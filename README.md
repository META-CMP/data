## Data collection

### Literature data base search

We conducted a comprehensive search for literature that econometrically estimates effects of conventional monetary policy shocks on output, (un)employment or the price level.
We detailed our search strategy for relevant literature in [Sec. 3.3 and 3.4 of our pre-registration](https://osf.io/4jxk3). We used the [EconLit](https://www.aeaweb.org/econlit/) and the [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/) databases for our search of primary studies. Due to differences in their search behaviour[^1], we decided to use one comprehensive query for EconLit and multiple simpler search queries for Google Scholar.

[^1]: Check [Sec. 3.3 of the pre-registration](https://osf.io/4jxk3) for details.

- The raw results and procedural details of our EconLit search can be accessed [here](data/study_search/database_search/raw/EconLit_search).
- The raw results and procedural details of our Google Scholar search can be accessed [here](data/study_search/database_search/raw/Google_Scholar_search).

This yielded 7455 bibliographic entries from our EconLit search and 10810 bibliographic entries from our Google scholar search. After de-duplication, checks for the availability of abstracts and the inclusion of additional studies from related existing meta-studies (see [here](data/study_search/database_search/processed/preparation_for_abstract_screening) for detailed documentation of these steps and related files), our consolidated dataset of primary studies with available abstracts totaled at 10714 entries.

### Abstract screening

This dataset of 10714 studies then entered into the artificial intelligence-supported abstract screening to exclude clearly ineligible studies according to our eligibility criteria as defined in [Sec. 3.5 of our pre-registration](https://osf.io/4jxk3). The title and abstract screening was conducted independently by two researchers using [ASReview](https://asreview.nl/). [Sec. 3.6.1 of our pre-registration](https://osf.io/4jxk3) presents the details of the abstract screening process. [Sec. 3.7.1 of our pre-registration](https://osf.io/4jxk3) defines the stopping rules for the abstract screening phase. See [here](data/study_search/database_search/processed/abstract_screening) for further documentation and related files of the abstract screening.

After the abstract screening we conducted some validity tests as well as agreement and overlap analysis on the merged abstract screening data of both screeners. We then randomized the order of the potentially relevant studies and prepared files to assist and document the full text download. See [here](data/study_search/database_search/processed/post_AS/testing_merging_dowload_prep.pdf) for the documentation and [here](data/study_search/database_search/processed/post_AS/testing_and_merging_of_AS_data.R) for the R code for these steps. 

### Full text screening

#### PDF retrieval 

Following the abstract screening, we proceeded to download full texts of the potentially relevant studies. The full text download was conducted by research assistants using standardized procedures as documented [here](data/study_search/database_search/processed/post_AS/full_text_download_HIWI_sheet.pdf). The studies were divided into [26 sets](data/study_search/database_search/processed/post_AS/packages_for_full_text_download) about 100 bibliographic entries each. For each entry, research assistants attempted to access PDFs via the provided URLs or DOIs, or by searching Google Scholar when direct links were unavailable or not working. All PDFs were saved using their BibtexKey as filename in a centralized folder (which we cannot share due to copyright). During the download process, assistants verified that each PDF matched the bibliographic information, checked for the most recent version of working papers, and documented various attributes (see [here](data/study_search/database_search/processed/post_AS/packages_for_full_text_download_updated) for the updated study sets) including availability status, whether the paper was retracted, duplicates, and whether it was a master's/bachelor's thesis (which we defined as non-eligible). Special attention was paid to accessing the most current versions of working papers that may have been subsequently published in journals.

#### Full text assesment and coding

After retrieving the full texts, we conducted a systematic assessment and coding of each study following standardized procedures documented in our [coding guidelines](https://github.com/META-CMP/data/issues/12). Each study was independently reviewed by trained researchers who first assessed whether the study met our inclusion criteria. Importantly, studies were marked for exclusion if they lacked proper identification strategies (e.g., simple OLS without shock identification) or did not report confidence intervals or mean/median estimates. Reasons for exclusions were documented in the [26 updated study sets](data/study_search/database_search/processed/post_AS/packages_for_full_text_download_updated).

For eligible studies, we developed a custom `R` package ([MetaExtractR](https://github.com/META-CMP/MetaExtractR)) to facilitate systematic data extraction using individual [`JSON` files for each study](data/full_text_screening/JSON_files),[^2] enabling version control and transparent documentation of all coding decisions through Git and GitHub. Researchers coded a comprehensive set of study characteristics, including identification strategies, estimation methods, sample characteristics, control variables, and publication characteristics. The `JSON`-based [workflow](https://github.com/META-CMP/MetaExtractR?tab=readme-ov-file#basic-workflow) allowed us to handle multiple models per study efficiently while maintaining the _single-point-of-truth_ principle. When necessary, coding decisions were discussed among team members to ensure consistency and accuracy across the dataset. We also extensively double checked coding decisions, with a first round of subsample double checks to identify systematic deviations between screeners and multiple further rounds to ensure consistency of these cases. For difficult variables, 100% of the coding decisions were double checked.
