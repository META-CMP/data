# Do monetary policy shocks affect output, employment, and prices? Meta-analyses on the effects of conventional monetary policy

This repository contains all raw and transformed data for our [pre-registered meta-study on the macroeconomic effects of conventional monetary policy](https://osf.io/cduq4). Below, we refer to the documentation of our data collection, management and transformation, as well as scripts for our data analyses.

## Data collection

### Literature data base search

As a first step, we conducted a comprehensive search for literature that estimates effects of monetary policy shocks on output, (un)employment or the price level.
We detailed our search strategy for potentially relevant literature in [Sec. 3.3 and 3.4 of our pre-registration](https://osf.io/4jxk3). We used the [EconLit](https://www.aeaweb.org/econlit/) and the [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/) databases for our search of primary studies. Due to differences in their search behaviour[^1], we decided to use one comprehensive query for EconLit and multiple simpler search queries for Google Scholar.

[^1]: See Sec. 3.3 of the pre-registration for details.

- The raw results and procedural details of our EconLit search can be accessed [here](data/study_search/database_search/raw/EconLit_search).
- The raw results and procedural details of our Google Scholar search can be accessed [here](data/study_search/database_search/raw/Google_Scholar_search).

This yielded 7455 bibliographic entries from our EconLit search and 10810 bibliographic entries from our Google scholar search. The merged file can be accessed [here](). After de-duplication, checks for the availability of abstracts and the inclusion of additional studies from related existing meta-studies[^2], our consolidated dataset of primary studies with available abstracts totaled at 10714 entries.

[^2]: See [here](https://github.com/META-CMP/data/tree/main/data/study%20search/database%20search/processed/preparation%20for%20abstract%20screening#3) for details on the additions from existing meta-studies.
