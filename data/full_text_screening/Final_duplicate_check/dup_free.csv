In our analysis, the international transmission mechanism works through movements in the exchange rate, commodity prices, short-term interest rates and the trade balance. We find that an increase in the federal funds rate causes the euro to immediately depreciate, while commodity, and in particular oil, prices decline sharply, reflecting a decline in demand. Lower commodity prices stimulate household consumption in the short run, and the higher aggregate demand induces an expansion of eurozone economic activity. Our results show that the effects of changes in the federal funds rate on commodity prices are greater than previously found in the literature. Our analysis also assesses the likely effects on the eurozone economy of the European Central Bank's (ECB's) own responses to macroeconomic developments. We find that the expansionary effect of lower commodity prices and a depreciated euro on the eurozone economy is partially offset by the ECB increasing short-term nominal interest rates to curb inflationary pressures in an expanding economy. This result highlights the importance of commodity prices and the euro–dollar exchange rate as inputs into European monetary policy-making, as seen, for example, in the Eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections used by the Governing Council to assess the risks to price stability.","10.1111/j.1468-2362.2010.01251.x","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1468-2362.2010.01251.x","Neri_2010_the",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,10

A structural VAR approach is used with non-recursive contemporaneous restrictions. Several interesting results appear in the analysis. First, consistent with the predictions of a stochastic rational expectations model, a domestic monetary contraction generates a transitory fall in output and monetary aggregates. Second, there is no evidence of price and exchange rate puzzles. Third, the source of Chilean output, price level, and real exchange rate volatility is similar to that identified in industrial countries: monetary policy explains a relatively small proportion of output, price level, and exchange rate variability. Finally, foreign monetary policy innovations have very short-lived effects on domestic interest rates and have no major influence over other Chilean macroeconomic variables; while risk premium shocks influence significatively both the interest rate and the exchange rate. ____________________ I am grateful to Natalie Baumer, Rómulo Chumacero, Christian Johnson, Paulina Nazal, Nouriel Roubini, Klaus Schmidt-Hebbel, Raimundo Soto, and Andrés Velasco for their helpful comments and suggestions.

One of them involves the ‘sign restrictions on impulse responses’ strategy applied recently by several authors. I also propose another approach, namely, imposing restrictions on implied shock history. My argument is that in certain cases, especially in the case of the Hungarian economy, the latter identification scheme may be more credible. In order to obtain robust results I use two datasets. To tackle possible structural breaks I make alternative estimates on a shorter sample as well. The main conclusions are the followings: (1) although the two identification approaches produced very similar results, imposing restrictions on history may help to dampen counterintuitive reaction of prices; (2) after 1995 a typical unanticipated monetary policy contraction (a roughly 25 basis points rate hike) resulted in an immediate 1 per cent appreciation of the nominal exchange rate (3) followed by a 0.3% lower output and 0.1-0.15% lower consumer prices; (4) the impact on prices is slower than on output; it reaches its bottom 4-6 years after the shock, resembling the intuitive choreography of sticky-price models; (5) using additional observations prior to 1995 makes identification more difficult indicating the presence of a marked structural break.",NA,"https://www.econstor.eu/handle/10419/83585","Vonnák_2005_estimating",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,15

In Chapter 1, I investigate the impact of US uncertainty shocks on China's macroeconomy with a focus on the dynamic response of investment. Using a structural vector autoregression model, I find that the wait-and-see mechanism of aggregate investment in the face of heightened US uncertainty disappears in China. Robust evidence confirms that the increase in state-owned enterprises' investment in response to heightened uncertainty explains this puzzle, while private-owned enterprises' investment decreases as expected. I apply regime-dependent local projections to link uncertainty shocks with credit regimes to explore whether the impact of US uncertainty shocks on investment in China has varied over time in connection with the states of bank loans. The empirical results support a positive response of state-owned enterprises' investment to increased US uncertainty during the tightening of medium- and long-term bank loans but a negative reaction when short-term bank loans are tightening. Finally, I show that economic policy uncertainty conveying political signals leads to a decline in state-owned enterprises' investment. Overall, this paper provides richer empirical evidence on the investment-uncertainty nexus. In Chapter 2, I examine the time-varying responses of monetary policy to uncertainty shocks in China. Based on China's monetary policy regimes identified by the narrative approach to identify China's monetary policy regimes, the rolling sample VAR confirms the time-varying patterns of distinct monetary policy instruments in coping with uncertainty shocks. The time-varying parameters VAR further shows that heightened uncertainty leads to a persistent decline in the policy rate and money supply, suggesting that the interest rate is a more effective monetary policy instrument in response to uncertainty shocks. I finally investigate the state-dependent impulse responses to monetary policy shocks under low and high levels of uncertainty and find that money supply instrument is less effective during the high uncertainty periods while the efficacy of interest rate instrument won't be weakened by the increasing uncertainty. Overall, the empirical findings support the on-going transformation of China's monetary policy from the quantity-based to the price-based policy rule. In Chapter 3, I explore the cross-country economic policy uncertainty (EPU) spillovers in time and frequency domains, with a focus on how China's EPU influences EPU in other countries. The time-domain analysis shows that China is a net receiver of global EPU but has stronger outward spillovers during the global financial crisis. The connectedness network demonstrates that China only plays a minor role in the transmission network of global EPU. The frequency-domain results further uncover that international spillovers of China's EPU are mainly driven by short-term spillovers. However, during the global financial crisis, the medium-term and long-term spillovers temporarily dominate compared to the short-term spillovers. Overall, the empirical results have important policy implications because economic policy uncertainty arising abroad might have domestic consequences through international spillovers channel.",NA,"https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=eoh&AN=1936429&site=ehost-live","Yen_2020_essays",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,19

Second, comparison of estimated parameters, impulse responses and forecast error variance decomposition between India and the US brings out the differences in policy responses, the structure of the two economies and their inflationary processes. There is a higher impact of interest rate shocks on output and inflation, and lower impact of technology shocks on output but higher on inflation in comparison to US. The former indicates monetary policy over-reaction and the latter validates a supply curve that technology shocks shift and inadequate adjustment of actual to potential output. Habit persistence is higher, markup and interest rate shocks are more volatile in India. Markup shocks play a much larger role in determination of Indian inflation again pointing to the importance of supply side factors.

This heterogeneity across local housing markets can be partly explained by variation in housing supply conditions—housing prices are typically more sensitive to changes in interest rates in areas where land is more expensive. The fact that housing prices in more expensive areas are more sensitive to changes in interest rates than in cheaper areas indicates that lower (higher) interest rates increase (decrease) housing wealth inequality. However, the effects of monetary policy on housing wealth inequality appear to be temporary.

In light of this work, the Federal Reserve's recent policy of “quantitative easing,” with its goal of affecting the supply of liquid assets, appears to be a radical break from standard practice. Alternatively, one could posit that the monetary aggregates, when measured properly, never lost their ability to explain aggregate fluctuations and, for this reason, represent an important omission from standard models and policy discussions. In this context, the new policy initiatives can be characterized simply as conventional attempts to increase money growth. This view is supported by evidence that superlative (Divisia) measures of money often help in forecasting movements in key macroeconomic variables. Moreover, the statistical fit of a structural vector autoregression deteriorates significantly if such measures of money are excluded when identifying monetary policy shocks. These results cast doubt on the adequacy of conventional models that focus on interest rates alone.

Chapter 1 briefly outlines the theoretical foundations for the reforms undertaken in Zambia since the mid 1980s and the process thereof. The main issues addressed were the removal of interest rate and credit controls, exchange rate devaluation and the use of indirect instruments in implementing monetary policy. The review indicates that although the control of inflation is still difficult and figures are still in double digit levels, annual inflation rates have reduced significantly compared to levels achieved in the early 1990s. The nominal exchange rate has been depreciating prompting increased intervention from the central bank. Despite the increase in nominal interest rates, real deposit rates have remained negative. Chapter two analyses the monetary transmission mechanism in Zambia. Vector auto -regressions are estimated for the pre-reform and post-reform periods.Variance decompositions and impulse response functions are examined to see whether there are any changes observed in the monetary transmission mechanism after the reforms. Different systems are estimated in each period using alternate variables as measures of monetary policy shocks. The results show that contractionary monetary policy is followed by a fall in both output and prices. When compared, results from the two estimation periods show that both the responsiveness of prices and output to policy shocks and the magnitude of their forecast error variance decompositions explained by these variables have increased since the reforms. The results also show that the impact lags have reduced. There is evidence of the bank lending channel both before and after the reforms. Of the mechanisms estimated, the exchange rate mechanism seems to be the most important mechanism for transmission of policy shocks to both prices and output during the post-reform period. Chapter three investigates whether monetary aggregates have useful information for predicting inflation other than that provided by inflation itself. Forecasting experiments are conducted to see whether monetary aggregates and selected financial sector variables are useful in predicting inflation.We perform forecasting experiments and compare the performance of different models. We also estimate an error correction model of inflation. Of the monetary aggregates considered, M2 contains the most information and its growth rate is significant in the inflation model. The external sector variables are also important. The results indicate that inflation exhibits a high level of inertia suggesting the presence of implicit indexation and significant inflationary expectations possibly due to past fiscal effects and low policy credibility. Overall, the foreign sector variables seem to be more important for movements in prices than monetary aggregates even in the long run. The importance of the exchange rate to stabilisation policy in Zambia is underscored by the results obtained in chapters 2 and 3. In this paper, we pursue this idea by investigating the effect of central bank intervention on exchange rates in Zambia. Using a GARCH (1, 1) model of the exchange rate, we simultaneously estimate the effect of cumulative intervention on the mean and variance of the exchange rate.We find that central bank intervention in the foreign exchange market increases the mean but reduces the variance of the exchange rate. The explanation leans towards speculative bandwagons and a 'leaning against the wind' strategy. Although there is no attempt to distinguish through which channel intervention operates, we argue that this is more likely to be a signalling effect rather than a portfolio balance effect. This effect operates mainly through the supply and demand of foreign exchange in the market.",NA,"https://gupea.ub.gu.se/handle/2077/2930","Simatele_2004_financial",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,46

Design/methodology/approach – For this analysis, a new Keynesian theoretical model and the ordinary least squared methodology were used. The objective to be achieved was to determine if there is some effect of economic transparency on accountability, inflation average, output gap, interest and central bank credibility. Findings – The results highlighted that central banks with greater transparency contribute to decrease inflation rate and interest rate. The findings denote that an increase in the information quality (clarity) implies a significant change in the rate of readjustment of market expectations. Furthermore, central bank transparency contributes to anchor the public expectations and to affect long‐run interest rates. Research limitations/implications – Impulse‐answer research was employed to show how the central bank transparency affects the credibility of monetary authorities. Practical implications – This paper suggests that the central bank publicizes its outlook, its policy monetary decisions, its expectations and its preferences. Originality/value – The originality of the paper resides in the fact that empirical and theoretical studies were made in the single work. Also, new results were found denoting that economic transparency reduces uncertainty effect and increases the power of incentive contract made between the BC and public.","10.1108/01443580710830961","https://doi.org/10.1108/01443580710830961","Ferreira de Mendonça_2007_economic",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,47

Impulse Response Function showing a shock in OPT by one standard deviation has a negative effect on economic growth (for short-, medium, and longterms) through out. In other words, if OPT increases, economic growth decreases. An increase in Reserve Requirement (RR) has an immediate negative impact on growth. In a slightly longer period, the impact of RR on growth becomes positive. However, in other periods (medium- and long-terms) the impact of RR on growth was negative.

Several key coefficients in the model--such as the slopes of the Phillips and IS curves, the sensitivities of domestic inflation and output to ""global"" output, and so forth--are allowed in the estimation to depend on the extent of globalization (modeled as the changing degree of openness to trade of the economy), and, therefore, they become time-varying. The empirical results indicate that globalization can explain only a small part of the reduction in the slope of the Phillips curve. The sensitivity of U.S. inflation to global measures of output may have increased over the sample, but it remains very small. The changes in the IS curve caused by globalization are similarly modest. Globalization does not seem to have led to an attenuation in the effects of monetary policy shocks. The nested closed-economy specification still appears to provide a substantially better fit of U.S. data than various open-economy specifications with time-varying degrees of openness.

This paper exploits a stylized model to identify the sources of macroeconomic and exchange rate fluctuations in the US. The model consists of a productivity equation, a demand function, an exchange rate augmented Phillips curve, a monetary policy rule and an exchange rate equation (uncovered interest parity (UIP) condition). The stylized model implies a set of short-run restrictions that allow for the identification of the structural shocks in a vector autoregression model in order to test the model's consistency with data. We use real GDP for output, GDP deflator for price, Federal fund rate (FF) as monetary policy. The other two variables are unemployment rate and Nominal effective exchange rate (NEER). Throughout the analyses oil price is used as an exogenous variable. The Sample period starts from 1980q1, and ends at 2008 q2 to avoid possible non-linearity arise from 2008 financial crisis. Results show that more than half of the fluctuation in unemployment and output is explained by two shocks namely productivity/technology shock and aggregate demand shock. Monetary policy shock can explain around 15 per cent while supply and exchange rate shock explain less than 10 percent of the variation in unemployment and output. These results from our simple model are compatible with those from more sophisticated models found in current literature. Hence, our model is more appealing to the policy makers. Further, to gauge the importance of monetary policy in stabilizing the economy, a counterfactual simulation exercise is performed. The exercise shows that monetary policy has stabilized inflation and unemployment, though at the cost of increasing variability in output. The findings of this paper emphasize that policy makers should be aware of the importance of demand side shocks such as policy uncertainty and money supply. A positive uncertainty shock (an increase in uncertainty) may reduce investment and may slow the economic recovery. On the other hand, a prolong period of expansionary monetary policy may make the inflation expectations less anchored. Therefore, the policy makers should try to keep the impact of policy uncertainty at the minimum level and should follow prudent monetary policy.",NA,"https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=eoh&AN=1910104&site=ehost-live","Alam_2019_importance",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,65

Central to this investigation is the use of the Vector Autoregression (VAR) approach to estimate time series annual data from 1980 to 2012. The cointegration test result revealed that cointegration exists. The Granger causality test showed that gross capital formation Granger causes exchange rate and real interest rate. The impulse response function showed that output responded positively to monetary shocks, as interest rate increased. For exchange rate and private domestic credit, output showed that even in the long run, the effects of the shocks might not be transitory in order to converge towards a steady state. The variance decomposition indicated that fluctuations in gross domestic product per capita (GDPPC) were attributed to itself. While the total contribution of the real interest rate (RIR) and exchange rate (ER) was relatively insignificant. The error forecast of RIR was attributed by itself with an insignificant contribution of GDPPC and none by ER and private domestic credit (PDC).

Monetary policy and exchange rate shocks have the largest effect on the finance sector, whereas output and exchange rate shocks exert most influence on the property sector.

It makes use of both theoretical and empirical methods. Motivated by structural changes in the financial sector and the central bank's policy conduct in the last decades, this dissertation reappraises monetary policy's impact on the real economy. While the first two chapters focus on conventional monetary policy using the short-term interest rate as the primary policy tool, the third chapter shifts towards unconventional monetary policy using the central bank's balance sheet. Such policies came to prominence when the policy rate reached the effective lower bound during the 2007-2009 global financial crisis. The first chapter analyzes the implications of the recent rise in bank concentration for the effectiveness of monetary policy. I study how the structure of the banking system affects the transmission of monetary policy for stabilization and the credit cycle. First, I use branch-level data on deposit and loan rates to evaluate how monetary policy pass-through depends on the level of local bank competition and bank capitalization. I show that banks operating in high-concentration markets, as well as under-capitalized banks, adjust short-term lending rates more in response to changes in the policy rate, especially when the policy rate moves upwards. Second, I build a theoretical model with heterogeneous banks that rationalizes the empirical findings and explains the underlying mechanism. In the model, monopolistic competition in local deposit and loan markets, along with bank capital requirements, impose frictions on the pass-through to the real economy. Counterfactual analyses highlight that the recent rise in bank concentration strengthened the pass-through by two channels, which I label the market power and capital allocation channel. Finally, I demonstrate that both channels strengthen monetary policy transmission to output and investment, amplify the credit cycle, and lead to a flattening of the Phillips curve. The second chapter, written in conjunction with Rudiger Bachmann and Eric Sims, focuses on identifying monetary policy shocks. We propose a new approach to estimate monetary policy shocks that exploits exogenous variation in the central bank's policy rate. In particular, we use the nowcast errors of the central bank with respect to the output gap and inflation as instrumental variables to isolate exogenous variation in the policy rate. We then compute the effects of the shock on the real economy using local projection methods. The results indicate that a contractionary monetary policy shock has a limited effect on output but a persistent effect on prices. In contrast to alternative identification approaches, there is no price puzzle when analyzing the period from 1987 to 2008. Further, we validate the identification approach in an augmented New Keynesian model assuming that the central bank observes current output and inflation with nowcast errors. The third chapter, co-authored with Ronald Mau and Jonathan Rawls, turns to unconventional monetary policy and studies the interaction between the central bank's main policy tools--the interest rate and balance sheet. First, we derive the welfare loss function in a simple New Keynesian model with a role for the central bank's balance sheet. We show that in this model, term premium volatility enters the welfare loss function along with the standard inflation and output gap volatility terms. We then study optimal monetary policy for three cases using a single or dual policy tools, (i) the interest rate as the primary tool, (ii) the interest rate and the balance sheet together, and (iii) the balance sheet is the only tool. We reach several conclusions. First, we find that with optimal policy rate behavior under discretion, an exogenous balance sheet expansion is deflationary and lowers the implied path of the short-term policy rate. At the effective lower bound (ELB), optimal policy lengthens the ELB event duration following an exogenous balance sheet expansion. This serves as a potential theoretical rationalization for the so-called ""signaling channel"" of central bank asset purchases. Second, with endogenous balance sheet policy in addition to the policy rate, the central bank can simultaneously stabilize inflation, the output gap, and the term premium. Finally, we show that endogenous balance sheet policy rules exist that support a permanent policy rate peg.",NA,"https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=eoh&AN=1936438&site=ehost-live","Hanisch_2021_essays",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,71

This study, by disaggregating bank loans data and using the relevant interest rates in Sweden, investigates the behaviour of banks after a monetary policy tightening. By using an unrestricted VAR model and impulse response analysis, our results show that a shock on the policy rate affects the main components of the banks' loan portfolios differently. Initially, banks do not reduce lending to firms and households and they present a sluggish reaction concerning the relevant interest rates. On the contrary, they reduce lending to mortgage credit institutions significantly since real estate lending can be considered as a risky long-term investment. Moreover mortgage credit institutions reduce lending for housing purposes to non-bank public. This reduction is mainly driven by flexible rate loans and loans secured on tenant owned apartments. Consequently, theses actions have a significant effect on real economic activity, by amplifying the initial shock from the tightening monetary policy. The latter result provides evidence of the bank lending channel in Sweden working via mortgage lending and could be very important for policy makers.","10.1007/s11156-010-0222-z","https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=eoh&AN=1289611&site=ehost-live","Papadamou_2012_banks",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,72

This study aims to investigate and compare the role of Islamic banks in transmitting monetary policy to the real economy in Indonesia and Malaysia, two countries with established dual banking systems and a growing number of Islamic banks. To achieve its objective, the study relied on Impulse Response Functions and Variance Decomposition Analysis, based on Vector Autoregressive (VAR) methodology. The model consisted of four variables (Islamic banks’ deposits, Islamic banks’ financing, overnight interest rates, and economic output), while the monthly data used cover the period between January 2007 and December 2016. The principal conclusion is that deposits and financing of Islamic banks play an important although a modest role in transmitting monetary policy to the economies of Indonesia and Malaysia. A plausible explanation of this result is the relatively low market share of Islamic banks in both countries. Additionally, the lower significance of Islamic financing in Malaysia, compared to Indonesia, is due to Malaysia’s smaller proportion of profit-loss sharing (PLS) financing. As a result, PLS financing has a smaller impact on Malaysian economic growth. The results suggest that to enhance their economic impact, Islamic banks need to increase their PLS-based financing.

These asymmetrical effects could only be offset by labour mobility and wage/price flexibility.

To date, studies using US data indicate the significant effects of unemployment on health, while at least some research using non-US data suggests little or no effect (e.g., Browning et al. (2006) and Bockerman et al. (2007) with Danish and Finnish data, respectively). One possible source of these varying impacts may lie in differences in fiscal and monetary policies across countries leading to variation in the level of social protection and the value of the nominal stock of debt. Although most extant studies predominantly focus on the association between unemployment and health, a few studies have investigated the association between fiscal and monetary policies and health.  [Data and Method]The data used are from all OECD countries from 1980 to 2005. Models of the natural log of the suicide rate per 100,000 persons are estimated using population-weighted least squares by gender and age. The key independent variables are two fiscal policy variables (real expenditure on unemployment compensation policy and health policy per capita) and one monetary policy variable (the money market rate). The regression also includes the unemployment rate and real GDP per capita and its rate of growth. The model controls for unobserved country fixed-effects, time-specific effects and country-specific time trends.  [Results]The major finding is that fiscal and monetary policy has significant effects on the rate of suicide. We find these effects vary according to the types of policies and the different phases of the individual’s lifecycle. Similar patterns exist for men and women. There is a significant protective effect of expenditure on unemployment compensation on suicide, particularly for persons aged from 20 to 44 years, but we find no significant effect for persons older than 45 years. An increase in the money market rate (implying tighter monetary policy) increases the rate of suicide for persons less than 54 years of age, but there is no significant effect for those older than 55 years. The other main findings are that macroeconomic conditions (as proxied by the unemployment rate) affect the suicide rate differently depending on the person’s age. For instance, an increase in the unemployment rate increases the rate of suicide for those in their 20s and aged more than 40, but decreases the rate for those in their 30s. Finally, the effects of economic expansion on suicide persist over time, while the effects of the policies examined disappear, mostly within a year.

Design/methodology/approach--Johansen's (1995) cointegration technique and error correction models are used to explore the long-run relationship among variables. To investigate how macroeconomic aggregates respond to a one-standard deviation shock to the underlying monetary measures, the authors estimate impulse response functions based on error correction models. The study uses quarterly data covering the period 1980-2009. Findings--The results provide evidence that there is a long-run stable relationship between the authors' monetary measures and the underlying macroeconomic aggregates. They also find that the industrial production adjusts at a faster speed relative to commodity prices and the exchange rate over the examined period. Further, they show that the short-term interest rate has relatively stronger effects on output as compared to broad money supply, whereas prices and exchange rates adjust more quickly to their long-run equilibrium when money supply is used as a measure of monetary policy. Finally, the authors find significant evidence of a price puzzle regardless of whether they consider a closed or an open economy case. However, an initial appreciation of exchange rate is observed in response to a one-standard deviation shock to money supply, indicating the overshooting hypothesis phenomenon. Practical implications--The findings of the analysis suggest that the interest rate-oriented monetary policy is more effective when the monetary authorities' objective is to enhance the output growth of the economy. However, in case of inflation targeting, the broad money supply seems a more appropriate instrument. Our findings also suggest that the monetary policy has a significant role in stabilizing both real and nominal sectors of the economy. Originality/value--The main value of this paper is to examine the significance of monetary policy for a developing and relatively small open economy, namely, Pakistan. The authors use the error correction model, which improves the estimation by accounting for the long-run association. They also take into account the world oil prices by including the world commodity price index as a control variable in their empirical investigation.

One of the major objectives of the monetary policy in Nigeria is economic growth using money supply and inflation control (price stability) as a measure; but despite the various monetary regimes that have been adopted by the Central Bank of Nigeria over the years, inflation still remains a major threat to Nigeria’s economic growth. And it is on this premise that we want to analyze the impact of monetary policy on the Nigeria’s economic growth from 1981 to 2021. This study used secondary data sourced from Central Bank of Nigeria Statistical Bulletin (2021) in its analysis.

Credit flows and the instability of credit appear to be at the root of the financial instability problem. On the other hand, some authors recently questioned whether a too early and too strong leaning against the wind policy by central banks might have higher costs than benefits in terms of output and employment losses. In our paper, we include in an inflation targeting model a financial stabilization goal. In contrast to infinite horizon and two-period models, we propose a finite horizon model. The model is solved by using a new global solution algorithm, called Nonlinear Model Predictive Control (NMPC), exploring stabilizing/destabilizing effects of price and nonprice (credit volume) drivers of the output gap, inflation, and credit flows. We substantiate the theoretical part of the paper by approaching the subject empirically, relying to that end on a regime-switching structural vector autoregressive (VAR) for the euro area. The empirical model contains standard macroeconomic variables along with credit flows and loan interest rates, the central bank policy rate, and European Central Bank (ECB) balance sheet variables. The regime-switching feature of the model is meant to capture the state-dependent relationship between the variables, with specific nonlinearities having direct counterparts in the theoretical model. Based on a sign restriction methodology, we explore conventional and unconventional monetary policy shocks, loan supply, and demand shocks, under different regime assumptions to reveal the state-dependent effects of both interest rate and volume-based policies.

Results from impulse response functions indicate a wide range of possibilities from the states, in response to an exogenous monetary policy shock. The second paper, ""The Effects of Adjustable Rate Mortgages on House Price Inflation,"" deals with house prices and the mortgage market. At the peak of the housing boom, adjustable rate mortgages represented more than two thirds of the subprime market and more than 20% of the overall mortgage market. The focus of this paper is therefore to study what determines adjustable rate mortgages and to address the possibility of a feedback effect between house prices and adjustable rate mortgages. The results are consistent with earlier finding on the importance of the spread between fixed rate and adjustable rate mortgages as the key determinant of the share of adjustable rate mortgages in the mortgage market. The assertion of the potential for a simultaneous relationship between house prices and adjustable rate mortgages is a plausible one. The third essay ""Structural times series models of regional income and house prices,"" studies regional house prices, and regional income and the relationships between them. The use of unobserved components model gives us the tools to study unobserved factors affecting the relationship between house prices and income that is not often considered in traditional regressions.

Empirically, the co-movement of output, inflation, unemployment, and real interest rates is too weak to yield precise estimates of r*. These challenges are addressed by applying Bayesian methods and examining the role of several “demand shifters”, including asset prices, fiscal policy, and credit conditions. We find that the data provide relatively little information on the r* data-generating process, as the posterior distribution of this process lies very close to its prior.

In the first chapter, I introduce subjective and model-free measures of macroeconomic uncertainty, which are based on belief distributions for future inflation and output growth from the Survey of Professional Forecasters. I find that quantitatively important uncertainty episodes are rare, but persistent. My estimates of macroeconomic uncertainty exhibit strikingly different dynamics compared to existing uncertainty measures, suggesting that much of the variation in these measures is not driven by macroeconomic uncertainty. By re-examining recent empirical work on the relationship between macroeconomic uncertainty and real economic activity, I find that macroeconomic uncertainty shocks have a large and persistent effect on real activity, without an evidence of subsequent overshooting. Due to its model-free and subjective nature, I believe that my measure of uncertainty provides a natural benchmark to distinguish among several competing hypotheses about the association between macroeconomic uncertainty and economic activity. The second chapter investigates the effects of an expansionary monetary policy shock that results in a 1% long-run increase in the price level on output, the bilateral real exchange rate with the United States and the price level in developing economies with inflation targeting. With an empirical panel-VAR model, we show that such a shock leads to a temporary increase in output, a temporary depreciation in the real exchange rate with the United States and a half percent contemporaneous increase in the price level. A multi-sector model with a staggered wage-setting mechanism and asymmetries among sectors with respect to the frequency of price changes is capable of explaining these aggregate dynamics. The third, and the last, chapter uses quotes on options written on crude oil futures to construct nonparametric risk-neutral probability distribution functions (pdfs) for crude oil prices.

In investigating disaggregate inflation, we find that a contractionary monetary policy is more effective in reducing inflation in the manufacturing sector than in the agricultural sector. Further, the sacrifice ratios in all manufacturing sectors have improved over time. However, the commodities prices of some sectors respond positively after a monetary contraction, which demonstrates the presence of a cost channel in the Indian economy.

We run SVARs with the monetary policy instrument, the stock index, and the macroeconomic variables and show the impulse responses of the stock index to the monetary policy shocks. After comparing two restriction schemes, the short-run Cholesky restrictions and the short-run and long-run combined restrictions for identification, we conclude that the latter restriction method leads to better estimation than the former one. In general, a contractionary monetary policy shock lowers the stock price, appreciates the Chinese currency, reduces the output gap, injects deflation, and shrinks the commodity price gap.

In this model, inflation exhibits a persistent response to a policy shock even in the absence of its intrinsic inertia, because the kink causes a measure of price dispersion, which is intrinsically inertial, to become a key source of inflation persistence under the positive trend inflation rate.

However, monetary policy could be counterproductive if cost side effects of monetary tightening prevail. High energy prices may increase the cost of production by reducing aggregate supply in the economy. If tight monetary policy is used to reduce this cost push inflation, the cost side effect of energy prices will add to cost side effects of monetary tightening and will become dominant. In this case, the monetary policy could be counterproductive. Furthermore, simultaneous reduction in aggregate supply and aggregate demand will bring twofold reduction in output. Therefore greater care is needed in the use of monetary policy in the situation of cost push inflation.

To do this, six diﬀerent Structural VAR models are estimated on US quarterly data for the period 1970-2020. The estimations suggest that the own interest rate (Sraﬀa, 1932; Teixeira, 2015) produces more persistent and statistically signiﬁcant eﬀects on autonomous consumption and on output than the real interest rate. The implication of these results is twofold. First, these ﬁndings conﬁrm the hypothesis that monetary policy transmission passes through autonomous consumption, in particular via changes in house prices. Second, the persistence of the eﬀect of autonomous consumption on output reaﬃrms its long run implications that goes beyond the business cycle, in line with the recent literature on autonomous demand-led growth. Furthermore, after the inclusion of rents and the overall price level, a positive monetary policy shock leads to an increase in rents, while housing prices decrease and the overall price level increases, giving a possible explanation of the Gibson’s Paradox. This contradictory movement in rent prices explains part of the price puzzle since shelter has a signiﬁcant impact as one of the main components of the Consumer Price Index (Dias and Duarte, 2019). These latter results open a path for the discussion of the linkages between monetary policy and distribution, since recent expansionary monetary policy did not fail to translate into worsening house aﬀordability leading to a decrease in home-ownership (particularly aﬀecting lower-income households). In this sense, it is evident that autonomous consumption has to move in step rather than detached from income distribution, making the case for income and redistribution policies.",NA,NA,"Góes_NA_a",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,140

There is no consensus among economists on the effect of monetary policy on economic growth. The results of previous studies on the effect of monetary policy on economic growth in Nigeria are mixed. The main objective of this paper is to evaluate the effect of monetary policy on economic growth in order to ascertain if monetary policy can be used to achieve SDGs in Nigeria. The effect of monetary policy on economic growth in Nigeria from 1991 to 2020 was evaluated using ordinary least squares regression model. The findings indicated that there is long-run relationship between economic growth and money supply, treasury bill rate and domestic credit provided by banks in Nigeria. The money supply and domestic credit provided by banks had significant positive effect on economic growth; and short-term policy interest rate had significant negative effect on economic growth in Nigeria in line with economic theory. Monetary policy is a veritable tool that can be used to achieve SDGs in Nigeria. Economic growth will increase and SDGs will be achieved in Nigeria if money supply and domestic credit provided by banks are increased and short-term policy interest rate is reduced. Increasing economic growth touches on the objectives of monetary policy of the Central Bank of Nigeria and calls for radical and proactive monetary policy towards achieving SDGs. &nbsp; Keywords: Monetary Policy, Economic Development, Ordinary Least Squares Model,Nigeria JEL Classification: C01, E52, O11","10.51594/ijae.v4i6.360","https://fepbl.com/index.php/ijae/article/view/360","Chuba_2022_monetary",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,162

The diagnostic tests for unit root and cointegration revealed a long-run relationship among the variables, thus indicating a long-run equilibrium relationship. The results from the study show the strength of monetary policy interventions in promoting economic growth in Sierra Leone through real effective exchange rates and monetary sector credit to the private sector.

The transmission mechanism from refinancing rate, liquidity and hryvnia exchange rate against the U.S. dollar to sectoral lending and economic activity was studied using a structural VAR-model. A significant heterogeneity in the response of sectoral indicators was found, which should be taken into account by the National Bank of Ukraine when setting up monetary policy. In particular, the transmission to consumer lending rates differs from the transmission to corporate and interbank lending rates, as well as government lending rates. Consumer credit rates are reduced due to rising liquidity and do not react to refinancing rates. An unexpected decrease in such rates after the devaluation was evidently due to partial realization of the currency risk. The volumes of lending to the population depend only on the hryvnia to the dollar exchange rate. That is, the National Bank has virtually no direct influence on consumer lending. In addition, the change in interest rate channel from the beginning of 2015 was studied using a panel VAR-model. A positive change in monetary transmission during this period was the emergence of an effective interest rate channel, and hence effective transmission of the NBU refinancing rate to the short-term rates on loans in national currency. The pass-through of the weighted average rate on the NBU refinancing operations to short-term bank lending rates is about 30-40% (that is, such rates increase by 0.3-0.4 percentage points in response to 1 percentage point increase in the refinancing rate).",NA,"https://ideas.repec.org//a/eip/journl/y2017i2p129-152.html","Petryk_2017_the",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,169

The first chapter of my dissertation models liquidity effects after a contractionary open market operation in a framework that highlights the frictions of limited participation in financial markets and search frictions in labor markets. It is shown that Lucas rigidities, with the aid of labor market rigidities, can generate more persistent liquidity effects under flexible prices. In addition, simulation results show that this adapted liquidity and labor search model can explain observed monetary dynamics in response to shocks of a plausible magnitude, and deliver substantial movements along a downward-sloping Beveridge curve. The second chapter of my dissertation proposes a dynamic general-equilibrium two-country model incorporating limited participation with labor market search as well as pricing-to-market. This framework is then applied to analyze the distributional effects of monetary policy shocks on real activities across countries and to account for exchange rate dynamics. Rather than focusing on monopolistic competition models with nominal rigidities, the qualitative and quantitative implications of this model for international liquidity effects and exchange rate behavior in a flexible-price environment are assessed. This sheds light on the international transmission of monetary policy and lends support to models that explain exchange rate dynamics with monetary fundamentals. The third chapter of my dissertation constructs a random-matching model with a clearinghouse and investigates the effects of private money on the volume of exchange, economic efficiency and social welfare in different monetary regimes. Under certain conditions, welfare in a monetary steady state with private money is strictly higher than that attained in a steady state in which bankers are prohibited from issuing private banknotes.",NA,"https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=eoh&AN=1003377&site=ehost-live","Li_2007_essays",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,170

First, asymmetric adjustment is captured in three macroeconomic relationships for investment, the consumer price deflator, inventories and house prices. These relationships are then embedded in a small macroeconometric model of the UK economy. Simulations on this model allow us to trace through the interactions of these asymmetries so that a monetary shock--measured by a change in interest rates--affects output and inflation in the short run in ways dependent both upon the sign of the shock and the initial state of the economy. A monetary easing has significantly larger effects on inflation when the economy is close to capacity compared with when it is in recession. These effects are captured by intrinsic asymmetries in the model, due to the use of the logarithm of interest rates and the logarithm of unemployment in the wage equation, as well as the asymmetries coming from the non-linearities which we have introduced explicitly.","10.1111/1467-9957.00203","https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=eoh&AN=0541311&site=ehost-live","Arden_2000_the",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,171

This study makes effort to address both two aspects of monetary transmission mechanism, namely channels of monetary policy and the effect of monetary policy shocks on key macroeconomic variables. To address these issues, the paper specifies structural vector autoregressive (SVAR) models and estimates them using quarterly data from 1997q3 to 2014q4. The identification schemes used in this paper follow Kim and Roubini and Raghavan, Silvapulle, and Athanasopoulos with some modifications. The overall result is that the identifying restrictions used in the SVAR seem to appropriately identify a monetary policy shock even though the exchange rate puzzle is found. The results show that interest rate and monetary aggregate have played the dominant channels of monetary transmission mechanism in Thailand, while an exchange rate channel is decreasingly significant. In addition, Thailand economy is somewhat exposed to the foreign sector especially for the world price of oil and the U.S. monetary policy. The results also reveal the linkage and influence of U.S. monetary policy on Thailand monetary policy. The empirical findings are then used to provide Bank of Thailand (BOT) with insight into identifying the important monetary policy transmission channels. It would help the BOT to implement an effective monetary policy for achieving price stability through the appropriate monetary channels.","10.17265/2159-5526/2017.03.002","http://www.davidpublisher.org/index.php/Home/Article/index?id=32774.html","Popkarn Arwatchanakarn_2017_structural",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,172

Although the news shocks literature often concentrates on news about future technological changes, we on the other hand study news about a country interest rate and a monetary policy interest rate in the context of small open economies (SOEs). Country interest rate news shocks refer to the anticipated changes in the rate at which the SOE borrows/lends in the international financial markets. Monetary policy news on the other hand refers to the anticipated changes of the policy rate usually transmitted to the public through ""forward guidance."" We argue that such pieces of news about interest rates change the expectations of economic agents and influence current economic activity without any actual change ever occurring. Further, we extend our SOE framework to study an optimal monetary policy rule for Canada. In Chapter 2, we examine how anticipated changes in future country interest rates influence the business cycles of emerging SOEs like Argentina and Mexico. To this end, we introduce country interest rate news shocks in a SOE model. We use annual Argentine data from 1900-2005 to estimate our model using Bayesian methods. We find that anticipated shocks to country interest rates explain a good deal of variations in the growth rate of investment and trade balance-output ratio of Argentina. The model also generates business cycles statistics that are consistent with those of Argentina. We find similar results for Mexico as well. In Chapter 3, we extend our SOE framework of Chapter 2 to a New Keynesian SOE model in order to explore the role of monetary policy news shocks in Canadian business cycles. Once again, we perform a Bayesian estimation of the model with Canadian and US data from 1981Q3-2012Q4. The novel feature of the monetary policy rule employed in this study is the inclusion of US interest rate deviations in the Canadian monetary policy rule motivated by the highly correlated US and Canadian short term nominal interest rates over the above mentioned time period. Our estimation results show that the response coefficient of Canadian monetary policy to US interest rate deviations is indeed positive. Moreover, both the unconditional and conditional variance decomposition of variables in the model reveal that although monetary policy news shocks explain some of the variation in the growth rate of output and consumption, overall they are not a major source of Canadian business cycles. However, they explain a good portion of the variation in money supply growth and inflation in Canada. Chapter 4 builds on the New Keynesian Dynamic Stochastic General Equilibrium (DSGE) framework developed in Chapter 3. In this chapter, we ask the following question: does reacting to US interest rate changes help the central bank achieve its mandate? To this end, we represent the mandate of the central bank by a loss function which is a linear combination of the variances of inflation, output gap and nominal interest rate changes which the central bank seeks to minimize. The weights attached to each of the three terms of the loss function represent different policy regimes. We assess the performance of the estimated interest rate rule of Chapter 3 with and without reaction to US interest rate deviations in achieving the central bank's mandate under different policy regimes. We find that under the estimated rule, reacting to US interest rate deviations neither helps nor hurts the central bank to achieve its mandate. Next, we ask the following questions: what values of the policy coefficients would minimize the loss function and would the optimal simple rule include US interest rate deviations in it? We find that the optimal rule has a positive coefficient on US interest rate deviations (larger than its Bayesian estimate) for all the policy regimes. It also has a large coefficient on inflation. Therefore, our analysis suggests that the central bank should include US interest rate deviations in its reaction function and should react even more aggressively to US interest rate changes and inflation than it did based on our Bayesian estimates.",NA,"https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=eoh&AN=1747018&site=ehost-live","Obaid_2018_an",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,179

Also in the short-run, when a shock is imparted to the policy rate, the response of the exchange rate is insignificant. Other than that, the corporate sector along with real output growth and banking sector variables induces a significant change in policy rate when a shock is introduced. With variables responding in the ideal direction to shock in the policy rate, it is inferred that the movement is in line with what ideally should hold over time.

As a first step in the analysis, the paper analyzes the issue of inflation convergence and the monetary independence in the context of the existing exchange rate peg and the capital flow policy of Nepal. The paper employs a number of macro indicators, and alternative empirical strategies based on the peculiarities of Nepal. The results show that the existing exchange rate peg has resulted in the convergence of the Nepalese price level to the Indian price level in the long-run. Despite the peg, there is an evidence of the independence of the Nepalese monetary policy to a large extent. The narrative approach of identifying monetary policy shows the evidence of the bank lending channel, interest rate channel, and the asset price channel of the Nepalese monetary policy though there exists a lag in monetary policy transmission due to high information asymmetry, adjustment costs and the poor financial infrastructure. In addition, the SVAR approach provides the evidence of the monetary policy transmission, in which the effect of the expansionary monetary policy on the gross domestic product decays to zero at about 8 quarters. Moreover, the paper also shows that the money market liquidity is largely guided by the remittance inflows in recent years. The analysis of the money market development indicates the need for the review of the operating procedures and the implementation aspects of the monetary policy.

Also, the error correction mechanism model was estimated after establishing the long-run interaction among set of incorporated variables using the Engle-Granger approach.

Monetary (interest rate) transmission is explored via estimated Vector Autoregression (VAR) model for the representatives of the core (Germany, France, Belgium), as well as the periphery (Portugal, Spain and Greece), in the period 1999Q1-2018Q4. Observing the transmission of ECB's interest rate (the shock) to gross domestic product (GDP) growth (the response), the results of variance decompositions and impulse responses indicate that interest rate channel works countercyclical in general. However, while stabilizing (countercyclical) effect is evident for the core (especially Germany), it is almost absent in the case of Greece. The conclusions highlight the vulnerability of the EZ in the sense of heterogeneous membership and, accordingly, asymmetric response to ECB's monetary impulse.

While in d,eveloped economies, changes in monetary policy affect real economic activity in the short-run but only prices in the long-run, the question of whether these tendencies apply to developing countries remain open to debate. Literature is divided over monetary instrument to be employed in developing nations. While developed nations target interest rates as their intermediate targets, developing nations employ monetary aggregates as their intermediate targets mostly due to inefficient financial market and uncompetitive banking sector. Despite Kenya implementing monetary policy aimed at achieving stable prices and fostering economic growth, the economy has been reporting low economic growth and high rates of inflation. This inability of monetary policy to effectively maximize its objectives is as a result of the shortcomings of monetary instruments used in most developing countries including Kenya. Preceding from such a background, this study finds significance by seeking to inform policymakers which policy variable relates to output and prices; this would be instrumental in guiding the choice of monetary policy instruments applied, their overall effectiveness and thus assist the Central Bank of Kenya (CBK) in meeting its policy goals of low inflation and sustainable economic growth.

For instance, housing prices in the United States, Spain, and Ireland have been marked by one of the most striking boom-bust cycles in their history. The concomitant increase in housing prices (and in some cases boom-bust episodes) across many advanced economies raises the following important questions. Was there a housing bubble across advanced countries? What are the main determinants of the housing price movements in these countries? Are the advanced countries' housing markets interrelated? The three essays in this dissertation analyze two main topics on macroeconomic price adjustments. The first two essays attempt to answer the questions raised above by studying the latest evolution in housing market prices in the United States and eight other advanced economies (six Western European countries, Australia, and New Zealand). The third essay analyzes the price evolution of the war bonds issued by the United States in order to finance the World War I. The first chapter of the dissertation estimates a set of structural Bayesian VAR models for the U.S., France, Spain, and Greece that examine the relative effects of developments in the real production sector, the financial sector, and international capital flows on the housing market. A second exercise attempts to identify the presence of housing price bubble regimes by estimating a set of two state Markov-switching Bayesian VAR models. The main results for the U.S. show that foreign capital inflows, measured by the current account balance as a percentage of GDP, account for more than 30% of the variance of the shocks hitting housing prices, while adjustable mortgage rates contribute about 38%. In France, monetary policy has the largest explanatory power for the housing market evolutions, while in Spain and Greece, the variable mortgage rates and housing investments exert the largest influence on the housing market. All the countries experienced a bubble regime over most of the 2000s. The second chapter uses a Global VAR model estimated using quarterly data from seven countries, for the period 1987-2011, to analyze the interdependencies that exist between domestic and international factors in housing markets. We find that housing price shocks originating in the U.S. have large spillover effects on all the countries, with the largest magnitudes on Ireland. This result suggests that housing markets may be subject to contagion effects and that housing can be analyzed as a speculative asset, based on international data spanning the past two decades. Linkages in long-run real interest rates are positive and statistically significant across all the countries, although they have a limited role on the evolution of housing prices. Negative shocks to the U.S. housing prices have negative and statistically significant effects on real GDP in the U.S., Canada, and Ireland. The third chapter studies the price fluctuations of war bonds issued by the U.S Treasury in order to finance the World War I between November, 1917 and December, 1920. Bayesian time series techniques are used to carry out the analyses. We are focusing on the effects that the bond purchasing program of the War Finance Corporation (WFC) had on the evolution of war bond yields. Our main results show that positive shocks to WFC purchases display a negative and statistically significant effect on all types of war bond yields. Furthermore, WFC purchases of Liberty and Victory Bonds, except the First Liberty Loan, had a statistically significant effect on the evolution of commercial paper rates. WFC purchases of the Second and Fourth Liberty Bonds had significant and positive effects on commercial paper rates, suggesting a twist in the bond yield curve.",NA,"https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=eoh&AN=1405083&site=ehost-live","Solcan_2012_essays",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,197

The second essay explores more the relationship between the housing market and the mortgage market with a special focus on the 2007-2009 financial crisis. The first essay studies the role of housing in the US economy since 1971. The focus is on the impact of the housing and mortgage markets on the business cycle and monetary transmission mechanisms. A ten variable TVP-SV-SVAR is used to address several issues. I study the effect of housing demand and supply shocks on the US business cycle and mortgage rates. Additionally, the impact of mortgage credit shocks on the US business cycle and the housing market is examined. Finally, I discuss the interactions between the US housing market and Fed monetary policy. The evidence shows: (i) housing demand shocks play only a small role in the US business cycle and in determining mortgage rates; (ii) housing supply shocks are more relevant to the 2007-2009 financial crisis than housing demand shocks; (iii) mortgage credit supply shocks have considerable effects on housing supply and inflation; (iv) monetary policy has a substantial effect on the US housing market since 1971.

Third, I evaluate the effectiveness of the quantitative easing (QE) programs in reducing the mortgage spread. Five main findings emerge from the estimations. First, a shock to the private-label share of MBS generates an increase in house prices, especially in 2004-2006. Second, housing demand shocks raise private MBS issues relative to securities issued by the GSEs. This response is particularly strong from 2003 to 2006.

Therefore, importing monetary policy from the United States via a dollar peg may guarantee stable inflation for AGCC countries but not necessarily stable non-oil output growth.

First, there is evidence that macroprudential policy in recipient countries can partly offset the spillover effects of monetary policy conducted in core countries.

Thus, we estimated a Bayesian VAR model based on an asset-pricing framework allowing for rational bubbles in the United States, the United Kingdom, and Canada. In addition, this estimation framework separates the fundamental component of housing prices from its bubble component, derived as the deviation of observed prices from the fundamental values. This allowed us to examine the responses of both components to a monetary policy shock and assess how bubbles may affect the responses of housing prices to monetary policy tightening. According to the results, we found that housing prices respond negatively to an interest rate hike, as common intuition would imply.

The paper uses a graphical analysis, impulse response functions, and variance decompositions to support the argument that the decline in inflation has in fact been a ""wage and import price moderation,"" brought about by declining union membership and international competition. Exchange rate effects have lowered inflation through cheaper import and oil prices, and have indirectly affected wages through strong dollar policy, which has lowered manufacturing wages due to increased competition.

"ref_0226","3",2248,"9X94HQ29","Villar, Daniel","Essays on Sticky Prices and High Inflation Environments",2016,NA,NA,NA,"thesis","It has been well established for a long time that sticky prices are fundamental to our understanding of monetary policy. Indeed, sticky prices are a common micro-foundation in models of monetary policy and nominal aggregate fluctuations, as monetary variables typically do not have real economic effects if prices are fully flexible. This is why price stickiness has been the focus of much research, both theoretical and empirical. A particularly exciting development in this literature has been the recent availability of large, detailed, micro data sets of individual prices, which allow us to observe when and how often the prices of individual goods and services change. This type of data has greatly improved our ability to discipline the theoretical models that are used to analyze monetary policy, and advances in sticky price modelling have also provided important questions to ask of the data. The most common data set used in this literature has been the micro data underlying the U.S. Consumer Price Index. While work with this data has produced important results, an important limitation is that it has, until recently, only been available going back to 1988. This is a limitation because it means that the data set only cover periods of low and stable inflation, which limits the types of questions that the price data can help answer. In this dissertation, I present an extension to this data set: in work carried out with Emi Nakamura, Jon Steinsson and Patrick Sun, we re-constructed an older portion of the data to extend it back to 1977. With this new sample, we can study the high inflation periods of the late 1970's and early 1980's, and in this dissertation I explore various questions related to monetary policy, and show that several important insights can be gained from this new data set. Chapter 1, ""The Elusive Costs of Inflation: Price Dispersion during the U.S. Great Inflation"", presents the extended CPI data set and addresses a key policy question: How high an inflation rate should central banks target? This depends crucially on the costs of inflation. An important concern is that high inflation will lead to inefficient price dispersion. Workhorse New Keynesian models imply that this cost of inflation is very large. An increase in steady state inflation from 0% to 10% yields a welfare loss that is an order of magnitude greater than the welfare loss from business cycle fluctuations in output in these models. We assess this prediction empirically using a new dataset on price behavior during the Great Inflation of the late 1970's and early 1980's in the United States. If price dispersion increases rapidly with inflation, we should see the absolute size of price changes increasing with inflation: price changes should become larger as prices drift further from their optimal level at higher inflation rates. We find no evidence that the absolute size of price changes rose during the Great Inflation. This suggests that the standard New Keynesian analysis of the welfare costs of inflation is wrong and its implications for the optimal inflation rate need to be reassessed. We also find that (non-sale) prices have not become more flexible over the past 40 years. Chapter 2, ""The Skewness of the Price Change Distribution: A New Touchstone for Sticky Price Models"", documents the predictions of a broad class of existing price setting models on how various statistics of the price change distribution change with the rate of aggregate inflation. Notably, menu cost models uniformly feature the price change distribution becoming less dispersed and less skewed as inflation rises, while in the Calvo model both relations are positive. Using a novel data set, the micro data underlying the U.S. CPI from the late 1970's onwards, we evaluate these predictions using the large variation in inflation over this period. Price change dispersion does indeed fall with inflation, but skewness does not, meaning that menu cost models are at odds with these empirical patterns. The Calvo model's prediction on price change skewness are consistent with the data, but it fails to match the positive relationship between inflation and the frequency of price change, and the negative relationship between inflation and price change dispersion. Since the negative correlations for dispersion and skewness are driven by the selection effect in menu cost models, the evidence presented suggests that selection is less substantial than in menu cost models. Chapter 3, ""The Selection Effect and Monetary Non-Neutrality in a Random Menu Cost Model"", presents a random menu cost model that nests the Golosov and Lucas (2007) and Calvo (1983) models as extreme cases, as well as intermediate cases, depending on the distribution of menu costs. This model includes idiosyncratic technology shocks and aggregate demand shocks, so it can be applied to price micro data, and to evaluate the degree of monetary non-neutrality implied by different kinds of menu cost distributions. This model can match the empirical patterns presented in Chapter 2. I find that a random menu cost model with a much weaker selection effect (than in existing menu cost models) no longer predicts such a negative relationship between inflation and price change skewness, but still predicts that the frequency of price change rises with inflation, as in the data, and contrary to the Calvo model. This model also predicts a very high degree of monetary non-neutrality, and the results overall provide evidence in favor of high non-neutrality. Chapter 4, ""The State-Dependent Price Adjustment Hazard Function: Evidence from High Inflation Periods"", considers a model-free approach to understanding sticky prices and non-neutrality. The price adjustment hazard function has been used to establish the relationship between individual firms' price setting behavior (micro-level price stickiness) and the response of the aggregate price level to monetary shocks (aggregate stickiness, or monetary non-neutrality), but scant work has been done to estimate the function empirically. We show first that various types of hazard functions (with widely different levels of implied aggregate stickiness) can match the unconditional moments that have been the focus of empirical work on sticky prices (such as the average frequency and size of price changes). However, the relationship between inflation and the shape of the price change distribution over time provides considerable information on the shape of the hazard function. In particular, we find that in order to match the positive inflation-frequency correlation, and the non-negative inflation-price change skewness correlations, the hazard function has to be asymmetric around zero (price increases are overall more likely than decreases) and relatively flat for small to intermediate values of the desired price gap. The latter feature means that our estimated hazard function implies a large degree of aggregate flexibility.",NA,"https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=eoh&AN=1606875&site=ehost-live","Villar_2016_essays",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,226

In contrast, monetary policy shocks only have insignificant effects during a household leveraging state. These results are robust to alternative definitions of leveraging and deleveraging periods, different ways of identifying monetary policy shocks, controlling for the state of the business cycle, the level of households debt, and financial stress. To provide a structural interpretation for these empirical findings, we estimate a monetary DSGE model with financial frictions and occasionally binding collateral constraints. The model estimates reveal that household deleveraging periods in the data on average coincide with periods of binding collateral constraints whereas constraints tend to turn slack during leveraging episodes. Moreover, the model produces an amplification of monetary policy shocks that is quantitatively comparable to our empirical estimates. These findings indicate that the state-dependent tightness of collateral constraints accounts for the asymmetric effects of monetary policy across the household leverage cycle as found in the data.","10.2139/ssrn.3417568","https://papers.ssrn.com/abstract=3417568","Harding_2019_monetary",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,237

The sample consists of Annual data ranging from 1990 to 2018. The GARCH process is used in empirical work to correct for potential autoregressive conditional heteroscedasticity. Results - Expansionary fiscal policy reduces output; whereas, expansionary monetary policy raises output. In addition, real appreciation of the Australian dollar, a lower U.S. interest rate, a higher real stock price or a lower expected inflation would increase output. The finding that expansionary fiscal policy has a negative impact on real GDP suggests that the negative crowding-out effect on private spending dominates the positive impact. Conclusions - Fiscal prudence needs to be pursued. Real depreciation of the Australian dollar hurts output. Monetary tightening in the U.S. generates a negative effect on Australia's output.

The results of two identification strategies are compared. One is based on traditional zero restrictions and, as an alternative, an identification scheme based on more recent sign restrictions is proposed. The main conclusion is that the recent slowdown is caused by a combination of several shocks: negative aggregate supply and aggregate spending shocks, the increase of oil prices in 1999, and restrictive monetary policy in 2000. These shocks are more pronounced in the USA than the Euro area. The results are somewhat different depending on the identification strategy. It is illustrated that traditional zero restrictions can have an influence on the estimated impact of certain shocks.

Design/methodology/approach This study uses an open economy structural vector autoregressive model to generate MPE. Then, an autoregressive distributed lagged (ARDL) model is used to analyze the effect of FD on MPE across countries. Findings The findings revealed that FD plays a different role in MPE across countries. In Malaysia, a more developed financial system tends to reduce the MPE on output, whereas in Singapore, results show that the more developed financial system (stock market capitalization) tends to increase MPE on output. However, in the Philippines, the main results show that the effect of FD (liquid liabilities) upon MPE on output is depending on the policy variable (interest rates or money supply). Originality/value This paper fills this gap by providing the first study of ASEAN-3 countries in examining how effective is a monetary policy in response to the development of the financial market across the country. Second, this paper considers two FD indicators, namely, the banking sector and capital market development in investigating its effect on MPE on output and inflation. Third, the authors construct the MPE in each country using a structural (identified) VAR model by aggregating the response of output growth and inflation rate on monetary policy changes (interest rate and money supply) using impulse–response function.

This document is divided into three main chapters to allow for a separate discussion of each individual category. The first chapter studies the impacts of uncertainty shocks on the US economy in the presence of different specifications of financial constraints. Different specifications of financial constraints include assets-based constraints and earnings-based frictions. Quantitative analysis based on empirical and New Keynesian models suggests that uncertainty shocks have adverse impacts on the US economy. Furthermore, the New Keynesian analysis also suggests that uncertainty shocks might have economic impacts of different nature depending upon the nature of financial frictions considered. Additionally, the chapter suggests that both the collateral constraints and earnings-based constraints might have tightened due to uncertainty shocks during the great recession of 2008/09. The Second Chapter studies the impacts of oil price shocks on US employment growth. Using the GARCH-M-VAR model on monthly data of employment growth and oil price growth from 1974 February to 2018 November, this paper finds that oil price shocks have asymmetric impacts on employment growth in private sector while public sector employment growth show symmetric responses. Furthermore, the paper argues that asymmetric impacts of oil price shocks on aggregate and sectoral job growths might be attributed to oil price uncertainty. The Third Chapter assesses the roles of financial development and financial openness on policy effectiveness in spurring economic growth. This chapter uses the Dynamic Panel GMM model on the data of 107 countries from 1980 to 2018. The empirical model analysis suggests that financial development is negatively associated with monetary policy effectiveness on increasing output growth. Additionally, the paper also finds that the diminishing impacts of financial development on policy effectiveness are more pronounced in countries with a higher level of financial development. Lastly, the paper also finds that the negative impacts of financial development on monetary policy effectiveness are independent of the degree of financial openness of a country.

First, we design a framework in which fluctuations in households financial wealth are allowed—but not necessarily required—to exert an impact on current consumption. This is due to the interaction, in the financial markets, of long-time traders holding wealth accumulated over time with newcomers holding no wealth at all. Importantly, we introduce nominal wage stickiness to induce pro-cyclicality in real dividends. Additional nominal and real frictions are modeled to capture the pervasive macroeconomic persistence of the observables employed to estimate our model. We fit our model to post-WWII U.S. data, and report three main results. First, the data strongly support a significant role of stock prices in affecting real activity and the business cycle. Second, our estimates also identify a significant and counteractive response of the Fed to stock-price fluctuations. Third, we derive from our model a microfounded measure of financial slack, the “stock-price gap”, which we then contrast to alternative ones, currently used in empirical studies, to assess the properties of the latter to capture the dynamic and cyclical implications of our DSGE model. The behavior of our “stock-price gap” is consistent with the episodes of stock-market booms and busts occurred in the post-WWII, as reported by independent analyses, and closely correlates with the current financial meltdown. Typically employed proxies of financial slack such as detrended log-indexes or growth rates show limited capabilities of capturing the implications of our model-consistent index of financial stress. Cyclical properties of the model as well as counterfactuals regarding shocks to our measure of financial slackness and monetary policy shocks are also proposed.","10.1016/j.jedc.2010.06.028","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0165188910001582","Castelnuovo_2010_stock",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,277

These open-economy models can be grouped into two economic paradigms. The first is the ""conventional"" paradigm (or Phillips curve paradigm) and the second is the ""money matters"" paradigm. Under the conventional paradigm, inflation is determined by price adjustments in response to inflation expectations and by factor disequilibrium in labour or product markets. Under the money matters paradigm, inflation is determined mainly by monetary disequilibrium. Although most models are based on the conventional paradigm, there are nevertheless important differences within that paradigm. In particular, there are differences in the inflation process (linear/non-linear Phillips curve), the channels through which monetary policy affects the economy (short-term interest rates or the yield curve), and the sensitivity of output and inflation to changes in interest rates and the exchange rate. The authors also examine the dynamic properties of the various models when those models use the simple monetary reaction function proposed by [Taylor, J. B. (1993). Discretion versus policy rules in practice. Carnegie-Rochester Conference Series on Public Policy, 39, 195-214].

This is as true in India as it is elsewhere. While its floating exchange rate gives the RBI monetary autonomy, the country’s limited degree of integration with world financial markets and RBI’s interventions in the foreign exchange markets limit the strength of the exchange rate channel of monetary transmission. The country lacks large and liquid secondary markets for debt instruments, as well as a well-functioning stock market. This means that monetary policy effects on aggregate demand would tend to operate primarily through the bank lending channel. Yet the formal banking sector is small, and does not intermediate for a large share of the economy. Moreover, there is evidence that not only are the costs of financial intermediation high but also that the banking system may not be very competitive. The presence of all these factors should tend to weaken the process of monetary transmission in India. This paper examines what the empirical evidence has to say about the strength of monetary transmission in India, using the structural vector autoregression (SVAR) methods that have been applied broadly to investigate this issue in many countries, including high-, middle-, and low-income ones. We estimate a monthly VAR with data from April 2001 to December 2014. Applying a variety of methods to identify exogenous movements in the policy rate in the data, we find consistently that positive shocks to the policy rate result in statistically significant effects (at least at confidence levels typically used in such applications) on the bank lending rate in the direction predicted by theory. Specifically, a tightening of monetary policy is associated with an increase in bank lending rates, consistent with evidence for the first stage of transmission in the bank lending channel. While pass-through from the policy rate to bank lending rates is in the right (theoretically expected) direction, the pass-through is incomplete. When the monetary policy variable is ordered first, effects on the real effective exchange rate are also in the theoretically expected direction on impact, but are extremely weak and not statistically significant, even at the 90 % confidence level, for any of the four monetary policy variants that we investigate. Finally, we are unable to uncover evidence for any effect of monetary policy shocks on aggregate demand, as recorded either in the industrial production (IIP) gap or the inflation rate. None of these effects are estimated with strong precision, which may reflect either instability in monetary transmission or the limitations of the empirical methodology. Overall, the empirical tests yield a mixed message on the effectiveness of monetary policy in India, but perhaps one that is more favorable than is typical of many countries at similar income levels.",NA,"https://doi.org/10.1007/978-81-322-2840-0_3","Mishra_2016_monetary",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,303

The VAR model reveals that the contributions of transition rates in explaining unemployment differ across shocks. After a technology shock, unemployment fluctuations are mainly explained by the job finding process, while the contributions of the two margins are more balanced for the monetary shock. The theoretical model is not able to reproduce the underlying mechanisms inducing unemployment. In particular, the conditional contributions of the job separation margin are overestimated each time. For instance, after a technology shock, 60% of unemployment changes are generated by this margin, while the data suggest a contribution of 28%.

My dissertation is motivated by the fact that financial intermediation plays a critical role in economic development in low income economies. Assessment of financial sector performance is instrumental to understand the dynamics of economic growth. My dissertation's contribution to the empirical literature on least developed economies stems from adopting rigorous and robust econometric techniques to high quality data. This paves the way forward to better assess the effectiveness of monetary policy and efficiency of financial intermediation in these economies. My analysis, which focuses on Egypt takes into consideration various political, economic and social transformations that took place during the past five decades and which have substantially affected the macroeconomic performance of the country. My dissertation follows the primary model for dissertations and is divided into three different essays. The first essay examines the Demand for Money in Egypt. The second essay investigates the presence of a Broad Credit Channel for Monetary Transmission. In the third essay, I present an Aggregate Model for Savings Behavior and its Determinants in Egypt. The objective and proposed scope of my research is detailed below. The first chapter studies money demand which is critical for defining monetary policy options. In the context of developed economies with fully functioning financial markets, money demand is influenced by transaction demand, speculation motive and opportunity costs. This doesn't hold for least developed economies where market imperfections and frictions can play a key role in money demand dynamics. These factors weren't adequately covered in the empirical literature. This chapter attempts to cover these aspect and contribute to the empirical literature with particular emphasis to Egypt. The chapter provides a mixed strategy for estimating the money demand function that incorporates shifting from a system of equations vector auto regression (VAR) approach that maintains the information relating to the feedback between variables, followed by vector equilibrium correction model (VECM) in order to investigate the nature of short term and long term interactions. Key conclusion is that real money demand in Egypt is stable and can be confidently considered by monetary authorities as an important tool to adjust for long run growth in the real economy. The second chapter focuses on the credit channel for monetary policy in Egypt. Past research has shown that healthy financial intermediation should be able to support monetary policy and has the potential to mitigate transmitting economic shocks to the real sector (Bernanke, 2007; and Stein, 1998). However most of the past research has focused on developed economies with little research being devoted to low income countries. was devoted to least developed economies despite their relatively higher contingency to volatility, political instability and difficulty in obtaining reliable data (Fernandez, 2003). The objective of this paper is to fill this gap in the literature and in particular provide answers to three main questions regarding the conduct of monetary policy in Egypt: (i) Does banks credit operate as a transmission channel for monetary policy? If not, what is the alternative channel that transmits monetary policy in Egypt? (ii) Is the credit channel important to guide monetary authorities and financial economics profession? (iii) And finally, how can Structural Vector Auto Regression (SVAR) be adopted to model monetary policy strategy for Egypt? Our findings confirm the existence of a--statistically significant--credit channel for monetary policy when considering the monetary base as an operating target. The key outcome is that the credit channel--if properly considered--can help authorities propagate monetary policy shocks to the real economy In the third chapter, I study the behavior of savings in Egypt. Private sector savings play a pivotal role in financing development and sustaining growth. Understanding the dynamics of determinants of savings is critical to inform economic policy and devise reform programs. The Egyptian government adopted an economic reform program in the 1990's, the main pillar of which was to support financial development and achieve economic growth. This followed a full liberalization of interest rates, allowing markets to determine the opportunity cost of holding money. The purpose of this paper is to investigate private savings behavior in Egypt--for the first time--using quarterly data covering 1991-2010 and adopting a Vector Equilibrium Correction Model (VECM). The key finding is that Egypt's private savings follow the Life Cycle Model proposed by Modigliani 1954 in the long term. Controlling for population growth; empirical results indicate that real interest rate and financial development are key determinants for real private savings in the long run. However, in the short run economic uncertainty proxied by inflation and devaluation of the exchange rate are key determinants of private savings decisions. Robust macroeconomic and monetary policies are pre-requisites to maximize private savings and financing growth in Egypt.",NA,"https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=eoh&AN=1606979&site=ehost-live","Rostom_2016_essays",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,309

To test for this, we build an otherwise standard New Keynesian model that incorporates non-separable government consumption. The simulations of the model show that when government consumption has a crowding-in effect on private consumption, it will dampen the transmission mechanism of monetary policy, and vice versa.

Theoretically, this paper is motivated by “financial accelerator” effects stemming from impacts of monetary policy on financing conditions. In this context, recent economic conditions in Japan deserve our special attention for several reasons. One, a large fraction of business investment financed by bank loans is secured by land. Two, excessively sharp increases in the land dependence of small firms with the asset price inflation in the late 1980s may make a collateral effect bigger, if it exists. Extending existing work to a model with land prices, I find a strong effect of monetary policy on land prices: monetary tightening associated with a rise in the short-term interest rate produces a significant and persistent decline in land prices. I then analyze a role of land prices in the monetary transmission mechanism. Two results are interesting. One, after monetary tightening, output falls. But the impact on output appears more severe and deeper than was predicted in existing studies. Two, the monetary policy shock turns out to be an important source of output variation, as opposed to the findings of existing work in which monetary policy explains output fluctuations very little. The implication is that together with reduced flows of credit after monetary contraction, movements in land prices may play a significant propagating role in the monetary transmission mechanism.J.

For that, a dynamic stochastic general equilibrium (DSGE) model was developed for Brazil, which was estimated through Bayesian econometrics. Design/methodology/approach In the basic model, the government does not have any type of fiscal restriction. The other two estimated models, however, consider that the fiscal authority implements some kind of fiscal rule. One of these rules is the Constitutional Amendment 95/2016 (EA 95/2016), which includes a limitation for government spending. The other Alternative Rule seeks to represent the characteristics of a more austere fiscal rule, as proposed by Wesselbaum (2017). Findings It was possible to verify in this paper that the implementation of EA 95/2016 by the Brazilian government does not produce statistically different results and that it reduces the welfare of the households in relation to the scenario without fiscal rule. Thus, the proportionate benefit of EA 95/2016 is less than the cost associated with this fiscal rule (less welfare). If the government adopts a fiscal constraint similar to the Alternative Rule, it is possible to considerably reduce the interaction between fiscal and monetary policy, thereby reducing the fiscal dominance policy over monetary policy. However, the cost in terms of welfare is much higher than the baseline scenario. Thus, the fiscal authority is subject to a trade-off among public debt stabilization and household welfare. Originality/value The study intends to contribute to the literature on three specific points. First, the monetary–fiscal policy interaction within a representative model of the Brazilian economy is discussed. In addition, the study considers that the government can adopt EA 95/2016 and the Alternative Rule, used in the US economy. Second, the impacts of EA 95/2016 and the Alternative Rule on household welfare will be quantified.

As a result, an important issue of concern in this study is how can the use of monetary policy tools mitigate the effect of external credit shocks on economic growth in Nigeria? In answering this question, this study attempted to assess the influence of monetary policy tools on external credit and economic growth nexus in Nigeria, using annual data covering 36 years for the period 1980–2015. The study adopted the Cobb–Douglas production function and estimated a specified model using autoregressive distributed lag cointegration approach.

The various relationships between monetary policy and asset prices in the U.S. economy are investigated through steady state Bayesian VAR (SS BVAR) and revised Taylor-rule (Forward-looking rule) based on the Generalized Method of Moments (GMM). The multi-step ahead forecasts using steady state Bayesian VAR (SS BVAR), standard BVAR, and conventional VAR are executed. Equal predictive ability tests following Giacomini and White (2006) verify that the SS BVAR is superior in forecasting performance especially in the long-horizons when compared to the cases of standard BVAR and conventional VAR. Alternative identifications involving the housing sector are explored in two different ways: an economic theory-based approach and algorithms of inductive causations. The impulse response of housing price and investment to Federal Funds Rates (FFRs) in all alternative identifications illustrate that the magnitudes are relatively smaller, less significant, and shorter when compared to the Choleski case. Also, this finding can be fortified by historical decomposition and conditional forecast analyses which confirm that the recent high peak in housing prices cannot be well accounted for except by the housing price shock itself. With all these estimation results, it is hard to agree with the argument that the considerable responsibility of the current housing boom and fallout is due to monetary policy shocks. Rather, it can be said that there is still enormous uncertainty between monetary policy and housing prices. Institutional shocks such as fundamental change of mortgage markets including the mobilizing the mortgage debts could probably compose the ""uncertainty"". How does the Fed respond to stock price and inflation movements differently across high and low inflation sub-periods? The replicated linear estimation results of Dupor and Conley (2004)'s indicate that the Fed raises its target interest rate responding to stock price gap with statistical significance. The linear estimation results, however, are not statistically robust to small changes in the breakpoint especially in the inflation coefficient. Thus, a nonlinear model is constructed as an alternative way to relax this problem. Upon the nonlinear framework, the identification of the dominant cause of apparent change in the Fed behavior, between structural change and nonlinearity, is explored. Consequently, both nonlinearity and structural changes matter in an explanation of the Fed's behavior. Given a structural change, the inflation coefficients' movements show that the Fed has responded nonlinearly to the expected inflation pressure across the high and low inflation sub-periods, while the stock price gap coefficients' show an explicit break around the early 1990s in line with Dupor and Conley (2004)'s finding.",NA,"https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=eoh&AN=1075605&site=ehost-live","Son_2008_essays",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,328

However, little work has investigated how the market structure of banks can affect the transmission of monetary policy. The purpose of this paper is to investigate to what degree bank concentration dampens or enhances the response of manufacturing to monetary policy changes. Design/methodology/approach To test how back concentration affects the transmission of monetary policy onto manufacturing value-added, the author regresses real value-added in manufacturing on bank concentration, monetary policy and the interaction of these two variables. The data set consists of a panel of 22 OECD countries across 59 manufacturing sectors from 1993 to 2005. Findings The author finds that bank concentration has two distinct effects: growth in manufacturing is lower in countries with higher concentration and manufacturing is less responsive to monetary policy as well. A loosening of monetary policy by lowering interest rates has a significantly larger effect on growth in countries with lower banking concentration. Overall, a 1 per cent decrease in the monetary policy interest rate increases industrial growth by 0.049 per cent when the three-bank concentration ratio is equal to the sample average, but the same monetary policy change has roughly twice the effect if bank concentration is only 5 per cent lower, all else equal. Originality/value The author is the first to measure how bank concentration alters the effectiveness of monetary policy using real economic activity as the output variable.

This study tests whether, in an expansionary monetary policy environment, banks with market power can reduce the impact of monetary policy transmission into lower interest rates, price stability and exchange rate stability, especially for emerging countries with opaque financial systems. Additionally, this paper suggests that because banks ration credit in opaque credit markets, the emergence of credit information sharing can mitigate banks’ credit risk when distributing credit, as they will no longer allocate credit solely through interest rates. However, the effect of bank market power on monetary policy transmission in the aftermath of private information sharing coverage varies across the African Union’s various economic communities. The analyses also considered Africa’s economic communities in investigating the nexus between market power and monetary policy transmission to assess the regional effects of the information sharing institutional arrangements. Regional economic communities can induce greater market power because of possible expansion of market share. The results of persistent first difference dynamic GMM show that banks with market power can augment the effort of central banks, which use monetary policy to induce price stability and real interest rates stability. The evidence also shows that the emergence of credit information sharing institutions complements the effect of banks with market power to channel monetary policy transmission into price stability and interest rates stability.

The paper's main results are: (a) the decline in the U.S. natural rate largely follows the slide of the long-run real interest rate in the forecast data, but is partly cushioned in the short run by the contribution of domestic and to a significant extent also foreign productivity shocks; (b) the fall of U.S. measured labor productivity during this time contributed to a concomitant fall in U.S. output potential; (c) the past decade is also characterized by the compression of markups (negative cost-push shocks) which accounts for much of the cyclical upswing in U.S. output in spite of the fall in its potential; and (d) monetary policy has shown its efficacy boosting U.S. output and sustaining U.S. inflation close to its 2 percent target against the drag on inflation from the negative cost-push shocks during this time.

The first essay studies the interaction between monetary policy, financial markets, and the real economy. The second essay shifts the focus to fiscal policy. Both essays employ Markov-switching Bayesian vector autoregressions (MS-BVARs) to determine whether there were regime changes in U.S. monetary and fiscal policy over the last 60 years. In the first essay, I evaluate the roles of short- and long-term private and government interest rates and inside and outside money in the monetary transmission mechanism. With money and credit markets present, changes in monetary policy set off a chain of relative price and portfolio adjustments affecting output and prices. I study interest rate and money supply rules within this monetary transmission mechanism by estimating several MS-BVARs on a quarterly U.S. sample from 1960 to 2018. The best-fit MS-BVAR restricts MS to the impact and lag coefficients of the monetary policy and money demand regressions and the stochastic volatilities (SVs) of the structural shocks. Estimates of this MS-BVAR yield evidence of a SV regime that coincides with NBER dated recessions. This MS-BVAR also identifies a regime switch in the Fed's interest rate rule and banks' demand for reserves around the dot-com bust of 2000 and again from the 2007-2009 recession and financial crisis to the end of the sample. Counterfactual simulations show the 2007-2009 recession and financial crisis would have not been as deep and long-lasting if the fed funds rate had been as low as -8% in 2009 and remained negative from 2010 through 2016. In the second essay, I measure the effects of government spending and tax shocks on U.S. output in a MS-BVAR. Motivation for estimating a MS-BVAR rests on the idea that MSBVARs account for anticipation effects caused by households, workers, firms, and investors reacting to announcements of future fiscal policy changes. The best-fit MS-BVAR produces several interesting results about fiscal multipliers. First, the government spending multiplier is near one during expansions but ranges from 1.5 to 2 during recessions. Second, there is no strong evidence of a negative tax multiplier. This finding is at odds with a number of studies reporting tax multipliers ranging from -2 to -3. Comparing the estimated fiscal multipliers lends support to traditional Keynesian theory, which predicts U.S. output responds more to government spending shocks than to tax shocks.",NA,"https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=eoh&AN=2009591&site=ehost-live","Rich_2022_essays",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,355

The first chapter documents the accumulation of foreign exchange reserves and the simultaneous increase in the foreign direct investment (FDI) for emerging market economies. The second chapter discusses the performance of FDI firms and domestic firms in creating jobs using firm-level data from Orbis. The third chapter studies the proper exchange rate and monetary policy when emerging market economies denominate their external debt in foreign currencies. In Chapter 1, I study why emerging market economies hold high levels of foreign exchange reserves. I argue that foreign exchange reserves help emerging markets attract foreign direct investment. This incentive can play an important role when analyzing central banks' reserve accumulation. I study the interaction between foreign exchange reserves and foreign direct investment to explain the level of reserves using a small open economy model. The model puts the domestic entities and international investors in the same picture. The optimal level of the reserve-to-GDP ratio generated by the model is close to the level observed in East Asian economies. Additionally, the model generates positive co-movement between technology growth and the current account. This feature suggests that high technology growth corresponds to net capital outflow, because of the outflow of foreign exchange reserves in attracting the inflow of foreign direct investment, thus providing a rationale to the 'allocation puzzle' in cross-economy comparisons. The model also generates positive co-movement between foreign exchange reserves and foreign debt, thus relating to the puzzle of why economies borrow and save simultaneously. In Chapter 2, joint work with Sakai Ando, we study whether FDI firms hire more employees than domestic firms for each dollar of assets. Using the Orbis database and its ownership structure information, we show that, in most economies, domestic firms tend to hire more employees per asset than FDI firms. The result remains robust across individual industries in the case study of the United Kingdom. The analysis shows that an ownership change itself (from domestic to foreign or vice versa) does not have an immediate impact on the employment per asset. This result suggests that different patterns of job creation seem to come from technological differences rather than from different ownership structures. In Chapter 3, I investigate how the devaluation of domestic currency imposes a contractionary effect on small open economies who have a significant amount of debt denominated in foreign currencies. Economists and policymakers express concern about the ""Original Sin"" situation in which most of the economies in the world cannot use their domestic currencies to borrow abroad. A devaluation will increase the foreign currency-denominated debt measured in the domestic currency, which will lead to contractions in the domestic economy. However, previous literature on currency denomination and exchange rate policy predicted limited or no contractionary effect of devaluation. In this paper, I present a new model to capture this contractionary devaluation effect with non-financial firms having foreign currency-denominated liabilities and domestic currency-denominated assets. When firms borrow from abroad and keep part of the asset in domestic cash or cash equivalents, the contractionary devaluation effect is exacerbated. The model can be used to discuss the performance of the economy in interest under exchange rate shocks and interest rate shocks. Future directions for empirically assessing the model and current literature are suggested. This assessment will thus provide policy guidance for economies with different levels of debt, especially foreign currency-denominated debt.",NA,"https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=eoh&AN=1868633&site=ehost-live","Wang_2020_essays",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,357

We use annual data from 1981 to 2019 and employ an autoregressive distributive lag (ARDL) framework to examine the long-run and short-run impacts of IPO ﬁnancing and bank rate on GDP growth rate. Our ﬁndings suggest the existence of a long-run cointegrating relationship between IPO ﬁnancing, bank rate, and GDP growth. We ﬁnd that IPO ﬁnancing does not have a signiﬁcant long-run impact but shows only a one-period short-run positive impact on economic growth. On the other hand, bank rate shows a long-run negative and a one-period short-run positive impact on economic growth. Findings overall suggest that IPO ﬁnancing does not signiﬁcantly contribute to long-run economic growth while giving only a temporary boost. Further, increases in bank rate - as one would expect - depress economic growth in the long-run, while generating herd behavior immediately. Our ﬁndings stress the need for encouraging more quality IPO issuances, increasing the issuance size, and ensuring proper utilization of the funds by IPO issuers to make the capital market a key driver of economic growth.",NA,NA,"Barua_NA_the",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,362

More importantly, central banks adjust policy in response to a wide range of information about future economic developments. As a result, estimates of the effects of monetary policy derived using conventional measures will tend to be biased. To address this problem, we develop a new measure of monetary policy shocks in the United States for the period 1969 to 1996 that is relatively free of endogenous and anticipatory movements. The derivation of the new measure has two key elements. First, to address the problem of forward-looking behavior, we control for the Federal Reserve's forecasts of output and inflation prepared for scheduled FOMC meetings. We remove from our measure policy actions that are a systematic response to the Federal Reserve's anticipations of future developments. Second, to address the problem of endogeneity and to ensure that the forecasts capture the main information the Federal Reserve had at the times decisions were made, we consider only changes in the Federal Reserve's intentions for the federal funds rate around scheduled FOMC meetings. This series on intended changes is derived using information on the expected funds rate from the records of the Open Market Manager and information on intentions from the narrative records of FOMC meetings. The series covers the entire period for which forecasts are available, including times when the Federal Reserve was not exclusively targeting the funds rate. Estimates of the effects of monetary policy obtained using the new measure indicate that policy has large, relatively rapid, and statistically significant effects on both output and inflation. We find that the effects using the new measure are substantially stronger and quicker than those using prior measures. This suggests that previous measures of policy shocks are significantly contaminated by forward-looking Federal Reserve behavior and endogeneity.",NA,"https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=eoh&AN=0714256&site=ehost-live","Romer_2004_a",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,369
"ref_0370","4",894,"8DE3Y3IM","Bianco, Timothy","Three Essays on Credit Markets and the Macroeconomy",2018,NA,NA,NA,"thesis","Historically, credit market conditions have been shown to impact economic activity, at times severely. For instance, in the late 2000s, the United States experienced a financial crisis that seized domestic and foreign credit markets. The ensuing lack of access to credit brought about a steep decline in output and a sluggish recovery. Accordingly, policymakers commonly take steps to mitigate the effects of adverse credit market conditions and, at times, conduct unconventional monetary policy once traditional policy tools become ineffective. This dissertation is a collection of essays regarding monetary policy, the flow of credit, financial crises, and the macroeconomy. Specifically, I describe monetary policy's impact on the allocation of credit in the U.S. and analyze the role of upstream and downstream credit conditions and financial crises on international trade in a global supply chain. The first chapter assesses the impact of monetary policy shocks on credit reallocation and evaluates the importance of theoretical transmission mechanisms. Compustat data covering 1974 through 2017 is used to compute quarterly measures of credit flows. I find that expansionary monetary policy is associated with positive long-term credit creation and credit reallocation. These impacts are larger for long-term credit and for credit of financially constrained firms and firms that are perceived as risky to the lender. This is predicted by the balance sheet channel of monetary policy and mechanisms that reduce lenders' risk perceptions and increase the tendency to search for yield. Furthermore, I find that, on average, the largest increases in credit creation resulting from monetary expansion are to firms that exhibit relatively low investment efficiency. These estimation results suggest that expansionary monetary policy may have a negative impact on future economic growth. The second chapter evaluates the quantitative effects of unconventional monetary policy in the late 2000s and early 2010s. This was a period when the traditional monetary policy tool (the federal funds rate) was constrained by the zero lower bound. We compute credit flow measures using Compustat data, and we employ a factor augmented vector autoregression to analyze unconventional monetary policy's impact on the allocation of credit during the zero lower bound period. By employing policy counterfactuals, we find that unconventional monetary policy has a positive and simultaneous impact on credit creation and credit destruction and these impacts are larger in long-term credit markets. Applying this technique to analyze the flows of financially constrained and non-financially constrained borrowing firms, we find that unconventional monetary policy operates through the easing of collateral constraints because these effects are larger for small firms or those with high default probabilities. During the zero lower bound period, we also find that unconventional monetary policy brings about increases in credit creation for firms of relatively high investment efficiency. The third chapter pertains to the global trade collapse of the late 2000s. This collapse was due, in part, to strained credit markets and the vulnerability of exporters to adverse credit market conditions. The chapter evaluates the impact of upstream and downstream credit conditions and the differential effects of financial crises on bilateral trade. I find that upstream and downstream sectors' needs for external financing is negatively associated with trade flows when the exporting or importing country's cost of credit is high. However, I find that this effect is dampened for downstream sectors. I also find that downstream sectors' value of collateral is positively associated with trade when the cost of credit is high in the importing country. High downstream trade credit dependence coupled with high costs of credit in the importing country also cause declines in imports. There are amplifying effects of credit costs for sectors that are highly dependent on external financing when the importing or exporting country is in financial crisis. Further, the magnitude is larger when the exporting country is in financial crisis. Finally, I find that these effects on trade flows are large when the exporting country is a developed economy, but they are muted for developing economies.",NA,"https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=eoh&AN=1807968&site=ehost-live","Bianco_2018_three",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,370

Inferences from generalized impulse response function (GIRF) analysis indicated that an unanticipated Nigerian monetary policy shock depreciates the Nigeria-USA exchange rate, stimulates growth, decelerates inflation and expands the money stock in the short run for Nigeria. In Ghana, Nigeria's monetary policy shocks similarly depreciates the exchange rate, slows growth with high inflationary impact in the short run. In the Gambia, unanticipated shocks emanating from Nigeria strengthens the Gambia-USA exchange rate, depresses growth and inflationary pressures. Sierra Leone shares the appreciation of its currency with the Gambia, in addition to an economic expansion and rising inflation. Money supply also increases to accommodate the expanding demand.

Impulse response analysis and estimation of an interest rate augmented Phillips curve in Korea indicate the existence of a cost channel eﬀect of monetary policy before the currency crisis period. Based upon these empirical results, this paper develops a dynamic stochastic general equilibrium model in order to explain the price responses in Korea. The cost channel of monetary policy transmission is a key feature in the model. Moreover, in order to examine the role of the banking sector in the monetary policy transmission given cost channel, an explicit loan production function in the banking sector is introduced. I ﬁnd from policy simulation that the cost channel eﬀect of monetary policy has fallen dramatically since the currency crisis in 1997. The model suggests that this result comes mainly from the facts that it takes longer for ﬁrms to adjust their output prices, and that the capital adjustment cost has declined since the currency crisis. I also ﬁnd that, despite the existence of the cost channel, when the banking sector supplies loans eﬃciently, monetary policy has an eﬀect on the economy mainly through the changing of aggregate demand. This implies that, given the existence of the cost channel, the central bank can reduce undesirable output price movements by enhancing the eﬃciency of the banking sector.",NA,NA,"Yie_NA_the",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,375

In other words, whether the interest rate, inflation rate and money supply have impacts on the economic growth or not. The unit root test indicated that the variables were stationary at I(0) and I(1), accordingly the variables are qualified to apply ARDL model. The result of the F-bound test confirmed long run co-integration between the variables, the figure of ECM is positive, it means that there is no long run equilibrium converging. The study shows that monetary policy only has short-run effects on the economic growth in Turkey. Inflation in the short run is statistically insignificant, while, interest rate and money supply are statistically significant and they have negative impact on the economic growth in the short run. In contrast, in the long-run,all variables including interest rate, inflation rate and money supply are statistically insignificant, in other word they do not affects the economic growth in the long run in Turkey during the study period. The study recomends Create appropriate environment for both domestic and foreign investors by restoring confidence and economic stability to promote economic growth. As monetary policy alone is unable to effectively promote economic growth, fiscal policy also should use in line with monetary policy to accelerate economic growth.",NA,NA,"Abdullah_2020_the",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,386

An important point in studying the interaction between monetary and fiscal policies is the coordination between these policies in order to achieve the goals of economic growth. Accordingly, considering the interaction of monetary and fiscal policies in different periods of the Iranian economy using the TVP-VAR method, which can evaluate the effects of economic policy changes on macro variables over time, this article studies the shock effect of monetary and fiscal policies and their impact on the two macroeconomic variables, namely inflation and GDP in the period 1379 to 1398. The results show that the effect of fiscal policy on GDP growth is larger than monetary policy. The analysis of the interaction of monetary and fiscal policies shows two important results. First, the increase in government debt has a greater effect on output growth and increased liquidity than the monetary policy shock due to its more stable and broader effect. Second, monetary policy can lead to more sustained inflation. The most important policy recommendation of this study is that considering the dominant role of fiscal policy in the Iranian economy in the period under review, it is necessary for monetary policymakers to pay sufficient attention to the central bank using a regular monetary policy framework to control inflation and the main goal that is controlling inflation and maintaining stable economic growth.","10.22096/esp.2022.530843.1526","https://economic.mofidu.ac.ir/article_697441_en.html","Gilak Hakimabadi_2022_measuring",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,399

Extending this line of enquiry, the paper analyzes the effect of monetary policy shocks on the aggregate as well as on the sectoral output of Indian economy using reduced form vector auto regression (VAR) model. In order to understand the direction of response variables (aggregate and disaggregated output) to standard shocks (monetary policy), we employ impulse response functions. We find that the impact of a monetary policy shock at the sectoral level is heterogeneous. Sectors such as mining and quarrying, manufacturing, construction and trade, hotel, transport and communications seem to decline more sharply than aggregate output in response to a monetary tightening. We also augment the basic VAR by including three channels-credit channel, exchange rate channel and asset price channel of the monetary policy, and analyze the sector specific importance of each of the channel. The channels through which monetary policy is transmitted to the real economy are found to be different for every sector. In most of the cases, multiple channels are responsible for the changes in the aggregate and sectoral output to the monetary policy shock.

We use a Bayesian vector autoregressive (BVAR) model with Minnesota priors and 15 monthly variables, extending the system of Christiano, Eichenbaum, with Evans (1999). The benefit of the BVAR approach is that it can accommodate a large cross section of variables without running out of degrees of freedom. To identify the change in the transmission process, we divide the sample size into two subsamples, namely the pre-GFC period (March 2001 to August 2008) and the post-GFC period (September 2008 to February 2016). The results indicate that a change in the transmission of monetary policy occurred after the GFC. The magnitude of the effect of a monetary policy shock on output is considerably greater in the pre-GFC period compared to the post-GFC period. Moreover, the impact of a policy shock on inflation is not statistically significant in the post-GFC period. The variance decomposition shows that the interest-rate channel has possibly weakened in the post-GFC period.","10.1111/saje.12238","https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=eoh&AN=1834544&site=ehost-live","Kabundi_2019_the",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,409

I do so by providing empirical evidence and by employing structural models calibrated to household balance sheets data. In the first chapter, I show that monetary policy has heterogeneous effects across euro area countries. I provide evidence of strong correlations between cross-country monetary policy potency and housing and mortgage market institutions, namely the share of adjustable-rate mortgages and the homeownership rate. This study highlights that the housing and mortgage markets play an important role in determining the potency of monetary policy across countries in the eurozone. In the second chapter, I incorporate the share of adjustable-rate mortgages and the homeownership rate into a quantitative currency-union New Keynesian model which I calibrate to Spain and to the euro area. My results reveal that a higher adjustable-rate mortgage share and a higher homeownership rate interact to amplify the effects of monetary policy on economic activity due to smaller mortgage interest payments and a higher fraction of mortgaged homeowners operating in the market. I use the model to show that a euro-area-wide mortgage market requiring shared financial regulation decreases the heterogeneous effects of monetary policy by weakening the pass-through to average mortgage interest rates. The last chapter shows that house price changes are strongly correlated in the data following monetary policy shocks. I build a New Keynesian model of the housing market where households choose the optimal amount of housing and mortgages. To accommodate realistic house price movements, I extend the housing market structure to include search frictions and house price rigidity so that the housing market clears through the relative fraction of successful buyers and sellers each period. I show that the house price momentum does not translate into slow movements of output and therefore it cannot explain the high degree of persistence found in the data following a contractionary monetary shock. I also highlight important redistributional effects between savers and borrowers in the economy. In particular, house price momentum coupled with the loan-to-value constraint forces the indebted households to cut their consumption for several quarters following a contractionary monetary shock.",NA,"https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=eoh&AN=2009244&site=ehost-live","Pica_2022_essays",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,411

Using the structural cointegrated VAR framework, the following questions are addressed. What is the role of money in the transmission process? What is the role of monetary policy shocks in exchange rate behavior? How important are exchange rate shocks in CPI inflation? Does monetary policy respond to exchange rate shocks? What is the impact of foreign price shocks on the domestic economy? The first model is identified with short run and long run restrictions and the second with contemporaneous restrictions motivated from rational expectation assumptions. The empirical results suggest that the impact of monetary policy shocks on output is temporary and marginal. Leading indicators of output are aggregate supply and IS shocks, the later more pronounced in the short run. CPI inflation is mainly due to aggregate supply and exchange rate shocks. Generally, monetary policy has served to dampen inflationary pressured induced by exchange rate shocks. Foreign price shocks modestly affect short run output and CPI inflation. We draw policy implications for monetary targeting from two key observations. First a positive monetary policy shocks leads to a sharp and persistent rise in money supply. But this is not translated into strong consumer price response. Second, though the money demand is stable, money demand shocks have modest role in consumer price and in the short urn. These suggest that reducing inflation further, especially to single digits, under the current regime is likely to be problematic. This may be due to a weakened link between money and inflation, giving rise to situations where getting the monetary target does no produce the desired inflation outcome and where money fails to produce reliable signals of the stance of monetary policy. We conclude that since food price has the largest share in CPI and exchange shocks have dominant role in inflation dynamics, policies meant to increasing domestic food supply and stablizing the exchange rate likely to help Zambia achieve and sustain lower inflation.",NA,"https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=eoh&AN=0802374&site=ehost-live","Mutoti_2005_monetary",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,418

We employ state-dependent local projections to compare monetary policy power – the sensibility of inflation to changes in policy interest rate – between periods of high credit of public banks and periods of high credit of private banks. We do not find evidence that monetary policy is less powerful in periods of high credit of public banks. Even though periods of high credit of public banks present a lower effect over output, those periods present less persistent price puzzles than periods of high private credit. Robustness of results is enhanced by performing several tests.

Yet measuring monetary policy effectiveness is not straightforward; it requires empirical work to understand the impact of financial infrastructure, competitiveness of financial markets, and current economic conditions. In particular, monetary policy effectiveness depends on the extent to which the chosen interest rate affects all other financial prices—including the entire term structure of interest rates, credit rates, exchange rates, and asset prices. This paper examines the effectiveness of monetary policy in Turkey by focusing on interest rate pass-through outcomes by way of an interacted vector autoregressive (IVAR) approach. The results suggest that policy-led rate changes are fully transmitted to deposit and credit rates within eight months. Competition in the banking sector (as well as that sector’s liquidity and profitability), dollarization, exchange rate flexibility, inflation, and term structure all have a positive effect on interest rate pass-through; whereas regulatory quality, GDP growth, monetary growth, industrial growth, and capital inflows have a negative effect. Using various tests, we find that the effect of financial development and macroeconomic variables on interest rate pass-through is neither robust nor time-invariant.","10.1007/s40822-017-0068-y","https://doi.org/10.1007/s40822-017-0068-y","Avci_2017_effectiveness",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,422

Three issues appear central to this disagreement: (1) the specific type of changes in the policy coefficients, (2) the treatment of heteroskedasticity, and (3) the real-time nature of the data used. This paper addresses these issues in the context of forward-looking Taylor rules with drifting coefficients. The estimation is based on real-time data and accounts for the presence of heteroskedasticity in the policy shock. The findings suggest important but gradual changes in the rule coefficients, not adequately captured by the usual split-sample estimation. In contrast to Orphanides (2002, 2003), I find that the Fed's response to the real-time forecast of inflation was weak in the second half of the 1970s, perhaps not satisfying Taylor's principle as suggested by Clarida, Gali, and Gertler (2000). However, the response to inflation was strong before 1973 and gradually regained strength from the early 1980s onward. Moreover, as in Orphanides (2003), the Fed's response to real activity fell substantially and lastingly during the 1970s.",NA,"https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=eoh&AN=0867503&site=ehost-live","Boivin_2006_has",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,432

While the first two are fiscal policy instruments, the latter is a monetary policy instrument. This paper aims to capture interactions among Indian monetary and fiscal policy actions, and the impact of such policy actions on select macroeconomic variables for the period 1990Q1–2011Q4. The policy actions are identified using the sign restrictions approach combined with magnitude restrictions in a Structural Vector Autoregression framework, and interpreted using impulse responses and variance decomposition. The results show that Indian monetary policy responds to tax rebate shocks and spending shocks differently. In the case of a tax rebate shock, Indian monetary policy responds by reducing interest rates thereby accommodating fiscal expansion. On the opposite, monetary policy seems not to accommodate expenditure shocks. Interestingly, the monetary policy shock is accompanied by a fiscal expansion that threatens the credibility of the central bank actions, thus indicating fiscal policy dominance. A comparison of the efficacy of the policies suggests that the interest rate is more effective in stimulating output. Out of the two fiscal policy instruments analysed, the tax rebate seems to be the better option for stimulating output considering the output-debt trade-off.","10.1080/17520843.2017.1297325","https://doi.org/10.1080/17520843.2017.1297325","Arora_2018_monetary",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,433

Lind and Mehlum (2010) U test estimation technique is used in determining the threshold level. Findings The empirical findings demonstrated that the monetary transmission mechanism through the credit channel is poor in the long run, and the effectiveness of monetary policy is dependent on the financial sector's performance. A non-monotonic relationship between monetary and economic growth was also discovered in the study. As a result, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) should not adopt an interest rate for monetary policy that surpasses 23.7%. Practical implications Because of the non-monotonic link between MPR and economic growth, it is necessary to expand the financial market and ensure that the policy rate does not exceed the threshold level. Originality/value To the best of the authors' knowledge, this is one of the first studies to look at the MPR as a potential source of negative economic growth.

It is however very important that a central bank should respond to the problem of monetary policy transmission mechanism. With respect to monetary policy shocks a monetary authority or central banks needs to know the elasticity of price rises in order to decide the amount by which value of the policy instrument should change so as to get hold of a preferred amount of change in inflation. The monetary authority should also be familiar with the standard amount of time taken for the full impact of a monetary policy shock on inflation to become visible. In cooperation with information of the suppleness, this it possible for the central bank to take timely measured policy actions aimed at managing inflation. The objective of this project was to establish the effects of monetary policies on inflation in the economy. To achieve this objective, a descriptive research design that covers a time series of five (5) years was adopted. The population of interest in this study consisted of monetary policy aggregates used by central bank over the study period. The study used secondary data obtained from the KNBS for the years 2009-2013.The variables of interest i.e. inflation rates, reserve ratios, CBR rates were entered into statistical package for social sciences and analyzed to examine their relationship and hence achieve the research objective. It was noted that there is a relationship between monetary policies and inflation. Evidence from the statistics showed that the coefficients of central bank rate are positive while that of reserve ratio is negative. This implies that there is a negative relationship between inflation rate and reserve ratio requirement while that of central bank rate is positive. The relationship can be used to formulate a targeted policy towards attaining acceptable level of inflation set at 5% in Kenya. The study recommends that in order for the country to realize a stable rate of inflation the central bank should focus on Reserve ratio requirement and develop best practices towards its full implementation. However the use of multiple monetary policy tools is therefore necessary so as to eliminate the bias related to period under consideration.",NA,"http://erepository.uonbi.ac.ke/handle/11295/98402","Koila_2016_the",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,445

Studying credit demand in China",2009,"China Economic Review","3","20","journalArticle","Chinese authorities have traditionally relied mainly on administrative and quantitative measures in conducting monetary policy, with interest rates playing a less prominent role. Additional support for this view resides in a number of earlier studies that have found that the impact of interest rates on the real economy has been miniscule. However, taking into account numerous reforms in the financial sector and more widely in the Chinese economy, interest rates may have gained some influence in the last few years. It is important to study the effectiveness of interest rates also in light of future reforms of the monetary policy tools in China. Whereas administrative policy measures were effective in guiding the behaviour of state-owned enterprises, the authorities may need to increase the use of more market-oriented monetary policy tools as the share of the economy in private and foreign ownership grows. We use a vector error correction model to study, within a credit demand framework, whether the impact of interest rates in China has become stronger over the last decade. Our results suggest that loan demand has indeed become more dependent on interest rates, albeit the channel from interest rates to the real economy is still weak.","10.1016/j.chieco.2008.03.001","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1043951X08000175","Koivu_2009_has",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,456

The use of vectorautoregression techniques provides empirical verification that monetary and fiscal policies do not have equal impacts on unemployment rates disaggregated by race and gender. In general, it was found that white males benefited from macro-policies more than any other category. However, black females were also shown to benefit significantly. Results were reported from both the 1970s and 1980s and indicate that these differential unemployment rate responses became magnified during the 1980s. The results for white males are consistent with a number of theories that have been offered by several writers, but the results for black females might seem, at first, to be difficult to explain. However, a close inspection of educational attainment scotes for black women over recent decades reveals a potential source of this finding.","10.1111/j.1536-7150.1991.tb02294.x","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1536-7150.1991.tb02294.x","Abell_1991_distributional",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,458

The main assumption in this model is that the dynamics of a large set of macro variables are captured by some observed and unobserved common factors. The unobserved factors are extracted from a large set of macroeconomic data. The key advantage of using this model is that it allows extracting the impulse responses of a wide range of macroeconomic variables to structural shocks in the federal funds rate. Findings: The results indicate that industries exhibit differential responses to an unanticipated monetary policy tightening. In general, manufacturing industries appear to be more sensitive compared to mining, and utility industries and durable manufacturing industries are found to be more sensitive than those within nondurable and other manufacturing industries to a monetary policy shock. While all industries respond to the policy shock, most of the responses are reversed between 12 and 22 months.","10.1108/JES-04-2020-0153","https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=eoh&AN=1950833&site=ehost-live","Ahmad_2021_monetary",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,459

If, however, the increase in the real interest rate also increases the probability of default on the debt, the effect may be instead to make domestic government debt less attractive, and to lead to a real depreciation. That outcome is more likely the higher the initial level of debt, the higher the proportion of foreign-currency-denominated debt, and the higher the price of risk. Under that outcome, inflation targeting can clearly have perverse effects: An increase in the real interest in response to higher inflation leads to a real depreciation. The real depreciation leads in turn to a further increase in inflation. In this case, fiscal policy, not monetary policy, is the right instrument to decrease inflation. This paper argues that this is the situation the Brazilian economy found itself in in 2002 and 2003. It presents a model of the interaction between the interest rate, the exchange rate, and the probability of default, in a high-debt high-risk-aversion economy such as Brazil during that period. It then estimates the model, using Brazilian data. It concludes that, in 2002, the level and the composition of public debt in Brazil, and the general level of risk aversion in world financial markets, were indeed such as to imply perverse effects of the interest rate on the exchange rate and on inflation.","10.3386/w10389","https://www.nber.org/papers/w10389","Blanchard_2004_fiscal",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,460

The Section Two challenges the conventional wisdom that government spending is effective and labor tax cuts are not effective, when interest rate is at lower bound (LB). I use a dynamic stochastic general equilibrium (DSGE) New Keynesian model with labor search and matching frictions to evaluate the effectiveness of fiscal policy. Labor search and matching frictions generate a steep aggregate supply curve, which changes the comparative curvature to the aggregate demand curve at the lower bound. Labor tax cuts are expansionary rather than contractionary, while government spending is not effective. The policy implication is that firms' supply side factors should be considered when conducting fiscal policy. After the Financial Crisis in 2008, the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) of the United States recovered only slowly to its pre-crisis level. There are two notable phenomena after the Great Recession: the fall in the labor force participation rate and the decline of the growth rate of Total Factor Productivity (TFP). In Section Three, I build a Dynamic Stochastic General Equilibrium (DSGE) model that includes endogenous growth and dynamic labor market components (including labor force participation), the first of its kind in the literature. A Bayesian estimation is applied to this model. I find four shocks (a monetary policy shock, a government spending shock, a financial related shock, and a labor productivity shock) can explain most of the variation in GDP that occurred after the financial crisis. Section Four evaluates and backtest commonly used Value-at-Risk(VaR) methods in practice, for three portfolios of assets: equities, bonds and currencies.

Findings The findings revealed that while the effect of monetary policy channels on the agricultural sector value added is largely heterogenous and significantly in-elastic, the one on the industrial and services sectors are overwhelmingly homogeneous and negative, but insignificant for the services sector. Moreover, the effect of monetary policy channels on sustainable economic growth is also homogeneously asymmetric, with imminent stagflation, while the interactive effects of monetary policy channels are heterogeneous on sustainable economic growth and economic sectors. Therefore, an inflation targeting monetary policy stance is generally recommended with prioritised exchange rate stabilisation amid sufficient fiscal space.

While the asset price channel of monetary policy transmission is clearly visible in empirical estimates, there is no evidence of monetary policy responding to asset price developments directly. Asset price changes also do not seem to influence the inflation path, suggesting why monetary policy may continue to refrain from responding directly to asset price cycles. Credit market shocks, however, explain significant part of asset price variations over medium to long-run, which though could be part of a broader comovement of variables over the business cycle, particularly real activity, credit flows and asset prices. Higher interest rates seem to cause contraction in output, credit demand as well as asset prices; hence, only the impact on asset prices should not be viewed as a good enough reason to use monetary policy for stabilising asset price cycles.

The New Keynesian dynamic stochastic general equilibrium model has become one of the standard approach to monetary policy analysis and macroeconomic forecasting. Therefore, many researchers are trying to come up with a better specification of the model. My dissertation goes in line with those efforts. The first chapter focuses on the specification of investment, the second on the firm's pricing, and the third labor market. The first chapter addresses the importance of rigorous investment specification. Dynamic stochastic general equilibrium (DSGE) models have a difficult time accounting for the slow response of investment spending to economic shocks that are generally found empirically. Four different specifications of investment dynamics are examined: (1) time-to-build as modeled by Kydland and Prescott (1982), (2) time-to-build as modeled by Casares (2006), (3) time-to-build as modeled by Wen (1998), and (4) investment adjustment costs as modeled by Christiano et al. (2005). Maximum likelihood estimation results indicate that the model with the investment lag specification of Casares (2006) fits the data significantly better than the other models. The second chapter examines the indexation schemes in Calvo-style sticky price model. While sticky price DSGE models with the dynamic backward indexation are widely used for monetary policy analysis, statistical plausibility of the indexation scheme has not yet been verified. The maximum likelihood estimation result does not find much support for the DSGE model with the backward indexation. The fit of the DSGE model with the dynamic backward indexation is no better than that with the static indexation. Also, the forecast of the model with the backward indexation is less accurate than that with the static indexation. The third chapter shows that when the workweek of capital and efforts are allowed to vary, the employment lag itself cannot generate a hump-shaped response of output to a monetary shock. The reason for this is that despite the fact that the size of employment is predetermined, firms can rely on other low adjustment cost margins such as the workweek of capital and efforts to meet the increase in demand due to a positive monetary shock.",NA,"https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=eoh&AN=1003327&site=ehost-live","Jung_2007_essays",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,468

Relative to policy shock identification, technology shock identification implies: (i) long duration durability in preferences instead of short duration habit, (ii) built-in inflation inertia disappears and price flexibility increases. In response to technological improvement, consumption durability increases hours worked because households temporarily increase labor supply to accumulate durables towards a new, higher steady state level.

However, monetarists argue that money supply is the most significant driver of economic growth by influencing the households demand for goods, firms production and hence economic growth. Hence, monetarists believe that monetary policy is more effective than fiscal policy.

The study shows that both fiscal and monetary policies have significantly increased the economic growth of Ethiopia. However, relative to the monetary policies, the fiscal policies are more effective. Finally, the study recommends that policy makers should focus on both policies to enhance the Ethiopian economy.","10.5171/2020.124855","https://ibimapublishing.com/articles/JARBT/2020/124855/","Demissew BEYENE_2020_is",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,477

The objective is to compare how monetary policy changes are transmitted to output in these economies. The analysis is based on evidence prior to the establishment of the common monetary policy within Economic and Monetary Union (EMU). A number of international studies over the last five years, in particular by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the Bank of International Settlements (BIS), have analysed how the effects of monetary policy can vary between countries. These studies have analysed most EU countries but Ireland has generally been omitted. This is due in part to the lack of the necessary quarterly national accounts' data for output but also to the small weighting of Irish output in the euro area. This paper re-addresses the omission of Ireland by using a constructed quarterly GDP data series from 1972 to 1998. The paper, in line with previous international studies, applies a common methodology based on time series relationships and economic theory that incorporates three variables--prices, output and interest rates. This common methodology is applied to thirteen EU countries. In order to compare the responses similar data series, sample periods and an identical econometric framework are used for all countries. The transmission mechanism is the process through which monetary policy decisions are transmitted into changes in output. Economic theory tends to draw a distinction between the short and medium term when distinguishing the effects of monetary policy on the real economy. Over the medium term inflation is primarily a monetary phenomenon and in terms of the real effects on output, money is considered to be neutral. In the short term, however, monetary policy is considered to have real effects. There are two important dimensions to the conduct of monetary policy to be clearly distinguished. The first is the adjustment of monetary policy instruments in reaction to changes in objective variables such as output and inflation. The second is the impact of monetary authorities' actions on the real economy. The paper concentrates on the latter. The monetary transmission mechanism consists of several inter-linked channels, such as the interest rate or money channel, the credit channel, the exchange rate channel and the asset price channel, which can differ substantially across countries. The focus of this paper is on the aggregate effect of these different transmission channels rather than on the relative importance of each in the different EU countries. The motivation for this focus arises from the need for the real effects of monetary policy to be relatively uniform across the different EU countries in order to facilitate the smooth conduct of monetary policy in the euro-area. It is also motivated by the lack of consensus on the effects of monetary policy changes through different channels in different countries or even within a given country. The lack of consensus stems from the difficulty in disentangling time series on interest rates into parts that are due to deliberate monetary policy measures and those that are due to endogenous responses of financial markets to unobserved economic disturbances. As a result, different empirical methodologies give rise to different estimates of the role and effect of monetary policy. The results from the common specification used by the international agencies would suggest that a monetary shock resulting in higher interest rates would seem to have an implausibly large and persistent impact on output in the Irish case in comparison to other EU countries. This may point to the need for a unique econometric specification for each economy in order to capture the differences in the monetary transmission mechanism more accurately rather than something unique about the Irish economy. The consequence of this recommendation would diminish the comparability of the results, but to proceed otherwise would be ill advised. Using a modified framework shows that the effects on output from interest rate changes in the smaller, peripheral countries in the EU, such as Ireland, Portugal, Finland and Denmark are deeper than those in the larger countries. While the magnitude of effects may be similar in these groups, the duration over which they occur can differ markedly. Therefore no consistent, common grouping emerges in terms of impact and duration. There is no evidence on the basis of this paper that there is a core group of countries, with the exclusion of Ireland, forming an obvious optimum currency area with the EU.",NA,"https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=eoh&AN=1028906&site=ehost-live","McCoy_2000_differences",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,478

In a benchmark full participation model, the effect of a contractionary shock on output is strongest in the impact period and decays over time.

Abstract: In the data, after a contractionary monetary policy shock aggregate output decreases over time, with a trough after four to eight quarters. This paper replicates the 'hump-shaped' response of output with a segmented markets model where part of the households are excluded from financial markets. A contractionary monetary policy shock is modeled as an unanticipated increase in the short-term nominal interest rate. Since households and firms need cash-in-advance to purchase consumption and hire labor, an increase in the nominal interest rate discourages the households' consumption demand and labor supply, and the firms' labor demand. In a benchmark full participation model, the effect is strongest in the impact period, and decays over time. When markets are segmented, however, the shock has an additional liquidity effect, increasing the real interest rate above fundamentals, and decreasing the growth rate of the participants' labor supply. As a result, the response of the aggregate labor and output has a trough several quarters after the shock. The model is able to replicate the sign, the magnitude and the persistence of the responses of output, money, prices and interest rates. It can generate a positive response of the real interest rate together with a negative response of the output growth rate.",NA,"https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=eoh&AN=0842918&site=ehost-live","Occhino_2004_market",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,479

The paper's principal aim is to provide stylised facts about the sectoral responses to unexpected changes in monetary policy and to help assess how monetary policy developments feed through the economy. It also provides indirect evidence about the underlying nature of the transmission mechanism. The first set of results relates to the largest industrial sectors - construction, services, production industries (including utilities and manufacturing) - which sum together to form the output measure of GDP. Thereafter the paper focuses on the manufacturing sector alone. Data sources for manufacturing are richer than for other sectors of the economy, which allows a more detailed analysis of the factors that might account for the pattern of responses to monetary shocks which we observe across manufacturing. Focusing first on the main industrial sectors, the paper finds that the effects of an unanticipated monetary policy tightening seem to be unevenly distributed across sectors of the economy. As might be expected, sectors such as construction show a sizeable and rapid decline in output, whereas others, like services, show a much more muted reaction. Manufacturing as a whole also responds quite sharply to a monetary tightening, but some large industrial sectors, notably the utilities, show a subdued reaction. Turning finally to the manufacturing sector alone, the paper shows that the (2 digit SIC) sectors that comprise manufacturing also exhibit diverse responses to a monetary shock. The paper shows the pattern of manufacturing sector responses seems correlated with the size characteristics of the firms in each sector. In particular, sectors which mainly comprise ""small"" firms tend to exhibit a stronger reaction to monetary shocks than sectors that mainly comprise ""larger"" firms. This might indicate that credit market imperfections play a role in the monetary policy transmission process.","10.2139/ssrn.74661","https://papers.ssrn.com/abstract=74661","Ganley_1997_the",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,480

Overall, the Bank of Canada is found to use a “hybrid” operating procedure in different monetary policy regimes, where it sets a monetary policy rate, while “leaning against the wind” to smooth exchange-rate fluctuations and to offset unexpected increases in long-term yields in order to maintain monetary conditions.

In the first essay, I analyze how the information contained in the disaggregate components of aggregate inflation helps improve the forecasts of the aggregate series using inflation data from Ghana. Direct univariate forecasting of the aggregate inflation data by an autoregressive (AR) model is used as the benchmark with which all autoregressive (AR), moving average (MA) and vector autoregressive (VAR) models of the disaggregates are compared. The results show that directly forecasting the aggregate series from the benchmark model is generally superior to aggregating forecasts from the disaggregate components. Additionally, including information from the disaggregates in the aggregate model rather than aggregating forecasts from the disaggregates performs best in all forecast horizons when appropriate disaggregates are used. The implication of these results is that better inflation forecasts for Ghana are produce by using information from relevant disaggregates in the aggregate model rather than direct forecasts of the aggregate or aggregating forecasts from the disaggregates. In the second essay, I use a structural vector autoregression (SVAR) to model inflation so as to identify the relative importance of shocks to real output growth, monetary growth and exchange rate depreciation in inflation dynamics in Ghana. The results show that neither monetary growth alone nor structural factors alone explain the inflation experience in Ghana and that the structural factors dominate monetary growth in the inflation dynamics. There is a fairly strong feedback between inflation and exchange rate depreciation both of which have weak relationship with monetary growth. These suggest that policies that boost domestic supply and therefore reduce import demand will be more potent than direct monetary management to curb inflation in Ghana. Finally, in the third essay, I the test whether the West African Monetary Zone (WAMZ) is a common currency area by using a vector autoregressive model to study the variance decomposition, impulse responses of key economic variables and linear dependence of the underlying structural shocks of the countries in the zone. The variance decomposition shows that the zone a whole does not have common sources of shock, which is expected because of the diverse economic structures of these countries. The correlation of the structural shocks also shows that these countries respond asymmetrically to common supply, demand and monetary shocks and will therefore respond differently to a common monetary policy.

The study used monthly data for the period 2000 to 2013 on the following variables: Consumer Price Index Inflation (CPI), money supply (M1), Repo Rate and the Nominal Exchange Rate (NER). The VAR methodology was used to investigate the response of inflation to monetary policy shocks under the inflation targeting framework. The findings from the study revealed that the response of inflation is not consistent with the Taylor rule hence increases in the repo rate meant to reduce inflation actually increase the inflationary pressures in the economy. This is due to the composition of the Consumer Price Index. Housing constitutes the largest weight on the CPI hence this has an impact on how the Repo rate affects inflation. Increases in the repo rate results in increase in the demand for rentals because prospective home owners tend to resort to renting because mortgage loans become expensive as a result of high interest rates. The increase in the demand for rentals pushes the rental price of houses. This results in higher inflation levels. Furthermore, the study established that the inflation targeting framework is effective in reducing inflation persistence because inflation approaches steady state with twelve months after exposure to structural shocks in the VAR system. The autoregression model of inflation showed that the sum of the coefficients is less than one (0.965) showing that inflation targeting has effectively reduced the persistence of inflation of South Africa.",NA,"https://repository.unam.edu.na/handle/11070/1664","Makuvaza_2015_an",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,499

I estimate a parsimonious recursive VAR in order to identify monetary policy shocks in the euro area. Its predictions as to the responses of the main economic aggregates are in line both with existing literature and with theoretical priors on the effects a monetary policy shock should produce, without suffering from the empirical puzzles that can be found in some previous works. The benchmark model is then extended to include the flow-of-funds variables. I find evidence of a certain degree of inertia in firms’ behaviour. In fact, following a policy tightening firms increase net funds raised at impact. Households adjust their financial investment and borrowing attitude quite rapidly after the shock, reducing the overall accumulation of financial assets and switching from deposits and mutual fund shares to short-term securities. Special attention is devoted to the impact of a policy tightening on loans to the private sector. As in previous studies on the euro-area economy, we find that an interest-rate hike is followed by an increase in loans granted to households and firms in the short run.

Using Bayesian MCMC estimation method we estimate a model consisting of output, inflation rates, interest rates, and exchange rates for the United States, Canada, Germany, Japan, and the United Kingdom. We find uniformly strong evidence over time that the exchange rate overshoots in response to an exogenous monetary policy shock. Furthermore, we find that the monetary policy shock played a significant role in the exchange rate dynamics, and its contributions were particularly large during the 2008-2009 financial crisis. Essay2: Commodity Return Comovement, Exchange Rate, and Uncertainty Shock This paper investigates how does the uncertainty shock affect the commodity return empirically, using a time-varying parameter dynamic factor model with stochastic volatility (TVP-DFM-SV). We extract a common factor and eight sector-specific factors from 43 different commodity returns(Ma, Vivian and Wohar, 2019). The common factor is interpreted as the combination of the shocks which only affects the commodity markets idiosyncratic through the general equilibrium (Alquist, Bhattarai and Coibion, 2019), and is orthogonal to the sector-specific factors and commodity-idiosyncratic factors. Then we show the time-varying impulse responses of the common factor and several relevant macro fundamentals to uncertainty shock identified by the external instrument variable (IV). We find that uncertainty shock decreases the commodity return through the common factor, and this effect is time-varying, specifically, during the recession it is stronger. Besides, the uncertainty shock could be a reason behind the negative relationship between commodity return and the strength of US dollar. Essay 3: A New Approach to Connecting the Dividend-Price Ratio and Stock Returns There is a long debate on the performance of dividend-price ratio on the stock returns predictability. Most of the literature argues that the predictability decreases after the 1990s. Since Campbell-Shiller decomposition shows that the dividend-price ratio contains the information of both the future returns and future dividend growth, a linear predictive regression of stock returns on the dividend-price ratio may generate biased results due to the measurement error or omitted variable issues. Therefore, this paper proposes a new approach to study the nonlinear Granger causality of dividend-price ratio on stock returns. We conduct an unobserved component model and connect stock returns and the dividend-price ratio through their innovations. We show that our model can be represented by a reduced-form ARMAX process, and it can increase the predictability both in-sample and out-of-sample.",NA,"https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=eoh&AN=1935940&site=ehost-live","Liao_2021_essays",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,513

Second, by breaking the income distribution down into different groups, I show that the higher an income group in the distribution is, the more favored it is by contractionary shocks.

However, during the pandemic, the central bank of New Zealand changed its policies 180 degree in 2 years, from an unprecedented low interest rate and a relaxed mortgage policy in 2020 to a 13-year record high interest rate and a tightened mortgage policy in 2022. Among the OECD members, New Zealand is the country that increased the interest rate the earliest and also the country that had its house prices fall the earliest. It provides natural quasi-experiments to test the monetary policy hypothesis empirically by the two policy changes as treatments on house prices. This study conducts a time series regression analysis on the housing markets of New Zealand to test the hypothesis in the pre-COVID and the COVID periods, ranging from 2016 Q2 to 2022 Q3. The results confirm that mortgage rates have a negative and significant effect on house price changes after controlling for the economic growth factor and the housing supply factor, no matter whether the monetary policy switches to expansionary or contractionary mode. The robustness test results of the housing markets show that a 1% fall/rise in the mortgage rate caused a 5.6% increase/decrease in house prices, ceteris paribus, in the COVID period.

While conventional impulse response analysis is restricted to evaluation using the conditional mean function, here, we propose an alternative impulse response analysis that traces the effect of economic shocks on the conditional quantile function. By changing the quantile index over the unit interval, it is possible to measure the effect of shocks on the entire conditional distribution of a variable of interest in our framework. Therefore we can observe the complete distributional consequences of policy interventions, especially at the upper and lower tails of the distribution as well as at the mean. Using the new approach, it becomes possible to evaluate two distinct features (called “distributional effects”): (i) a change in the dispersion of the conditional distribution of interest after a shock, and (ii) a change in the degree of skewness of the conditional distribution caused by a policy intervention. None of these features can be observed in the conventional impulse response analysis exclusively based on the conditional mean function. In addition to proposing the QIRF, our second contribution is to present a new way to jointly estimate a system of multiple quantile functions. Our proposed system quantile estimator is obtained by extending the result of Jun and Pinkse (2009) to the time series context.

Thus, we will use eight structural variable SVAR tools by using monthly time data series running from 1990:1 to 2014:12. This SVAR model is also carried out to generate impulse response function that raises the impact of economic policy shocks on growth in Cote d¡¯Ivoire. In addition, from the estimated SVAR equation, we passed through the estimated structural imposition of restrictions and we generated the forecast error variance decomposition analyses that help us make prediction. Our empirical results demonstrate that innovations in monetary aggregate impact in real activities and prices although very low. This implies that monetary policy shocks are not the main determinant of business cycle movements in Cote d¡¯Ivoire.

Using Jordanian data during a period when its currency was pegged to the U.S. dollar, vector auto-regression analysis reveals that there is evidence of a strong U.S. monetary policy influence on the Jordanian economy. The results show that adjustment of the policy rate by the central bank of Jordan in response to Federal Reserve actions has no significant impact on output while the interest rate differentials tend to have an immediate influence on inflation with short lags albeit small in magnitude. Although changes in the Jordanian financial system structure have altered the dynamics of the distributional effects of monetary policy shocks, the move towards market-based financial mechanism has made little difference to the relationships between financial and real variables. This finding of the weakness of the monetary transmission mechanism in Jordan is consistent with the open-economy model's argument that monetary policy is constrained in affecting real economic activity under fixed exchange rate systems. A key point of this study is that pegging the exchange rate is an impractical choice for a small economy that is interested in pursuing independent domestic macroeconomic policy goals.",NA,"https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=eoh&AN=1335846&site=ehost-live","Al-Lozi_2011_financial",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,543

Atiqur","External shock, monetary policy and the domestic economy: A structural VAR approach for Bangladesh",2015,"The Journal of Developing Areas","6","49","journalArticle",", Economies around the world are interdependent with one another in the present era of globalization. While some global shocks may affect the countries of the world together, domestic policies of a country sometimes can hardly work independent of external factors. Keeping these in view, a large body of literature has developed to address the impact of external shock on domestic economy as well as examining effectiveness of domestic policy in the context of an open economy. While effectiveness of monetary policy has been well studied in the context of both developed world as well as in the developing countries, only a few studies have been conducted in this field in Bangladesh and all these studies are made in a closed economy framework. Moreover, there is no study to formally examine the impact of external shock in Bangladesh. On this backdrop, the present paper makes an attempt to simultaneously assess the impact of external shock and that of monetary policy on the economy of Bangladesh. It builds up a structural vector autoregression (SVAR) model of Bangladesh in an open economy set up. Contemporaneous restrictions are set based on the spirit of the existing literature and the specific condition of Bangladesh economy. The SVAR model is estimated with quarterly data ranging from the year 1989 to 2013. Impulse response function and the variance decomposition analysis are used in exploring the importance of monetary policy and external shocks in explaining variation in domestic price level and output. Estimated Impulse response functions show that innovation in reserve money has a positive impact on price and output, although impact on price level is less significant. On the other hand external shocks seem to have more prominent impact on the domestic economy. Innovation in OECD GDP also has significant positive impact on domestic output of Bangladesh. Shocks in foreign price have an immediate positive impact on domestic prices. Variance decomposition exercise shows that external shocks weight more in explaining variation in domestic price and output compared to the monetary policy. Furthermore, effectiveness of monetary policy in the open economy model of Bangladesh economy seems to be lower compared to that in a closed economy version of the economy, implying that exposure to the rest of the world dilutes the effectiveness of domestic policy of Bangladesh. The findings have important implications. First, as monetary expansion has positive impact on price level, monetary tightening would be the right policy in controlling inflation. However, this may not always bring high success if the external factors are not favorable as the study finds importance of external factor affecting both price level and GDP. On the other hand, as innovation in OECD GDP has positive impact on GDP of Bangladesh, global recovery may have a positive stimulus to GDP growth of the country.","10.1353/jda.2015.0081","https://muse.jhu.edu/pub/51/article/586760","Rahman_2015_external",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,545

On the basis of the above findings and the evidence from other studies, lending and inflation rate generated substantial destabilizing impacts on the economic growth, suggesting that the monetary authorities should play a critical role in creating an enabling environment for growth. The determination of the optimal lending rate should reflect the overall internal rate of returns in the productive sectors with due attention to market fundamentals. In line with this, the Central Bank of CEMAC should be given complete instrumental autonomy to operate depending on a set of in-built targets by the individual countries of the zone.

The first one is the difficulty to identify the most appropriate indicator of monetary policy stance, which is usually assumed rather than determined from an estimated model. The second one is the fact that monetary policy decisions are based on the analysis of a wide range of economic and financial data, which is at odds with the small number of variables specified in most VAR models. To overcome the first issue, Bernanke and Mihov (1998) proposed a semi-structural VAR model from which the indicator of monetary policy stance can be derived rather than assumed. Meanwhile, the data problem has been resolved recently by Bernanke, Boivin and Eliasz (2005) using a Factor-Augmented Vector Autoregressive (FAVAR) model. In order to capture these two issues simultaneously, we propose an extension of the FAVAR model that incorporates a semi-structural identification approach a la Bernanke and Mihov, resulting in a VAR model that we denominate SS-FAVAR. Using data for Peru, the results show that the SS-FAVAR's impulse-response functions (IRFs) provide a more coherent picture of the effects of monetary policy shocks compared to the IRFs of alternative VAR models.

US monetary policy generates sizable output spillovers to the rest of the world, which are larger than the domestic effects in the US for many economies. The magnitude of spillovers depends on the receiving country's trade and financial integration, de jure financial openness, exchange rate regime, financial market development, labour market rigidities, industry structure, and participation in global value chains. The role of these country characteristics for the spillovers often differs across advanced and non-advanced economies and also involves non-linearities. Furthermore, economies that experience larger spillovers from conventional US monetary policy also displayed larger downward revisions of their growth forecasts in spring 2013 when the Federal Reserve upset markets by discussing tapering off quantitative easing. The results of this paper suggest that policymakers could mitigate their economies' vulnerability to US monetary policy by fostering trade integration as well as domestic financial market development, increasing the flexibility of exchange rates, and reducing frictions in labour markets.

The first chapter examines how monetary policy shocks in the U.S. affect the flows of workers among three labor market categories--employment, unemployment, and non-participation--and assesses each flow's relative importance to changes in labor market ""stock"" variables like the unemployment rate. I find that job loss accounts for the largest portion of monetary policy's effect on labor markets. I develop a New Keynesian model that incorporates these channels and show how a central bank can achieve welfare gains from targeting job loss, rather than output, in an otherwise standard Taylor rule. The second chapter examines the role of monetary policy in ""job polarization."" I argue that contractionary monetary policy has accelerated the decline of employment in routine occupations, which largely affected workers with a high-school degree but no college. In part by disproportionately affecting industries with high shares of routine occupations, contractionary monetary policy shocks lead to large and persistent shifts away from routine employment. Expansionary shocks, on the other hand, have little effect on these industries. Indeed, monetary policy's effect on overall employment is concentrated in routine jobs. These results highlight monetary policy's role in generating fluctuations not only in the level of employment, but also the composition of employment across occupations and industries. The third chapter introduces new direct measures of uncertainty derived from the Michigan Survey of Consumers. The series underlying these new measures are more strongly correlated with economic activity than many other series that are the basis for uncertainty proxies. The survey also facilitates comparison with response dispersion or disagreement, a commonly used proxy for uncertainty in the literature. Dispersion measures have low or negative correlation with direct measures of uncertainty and often have causal effects of opposite sign, suggesting that they are poor proxies for uncertainty. For the measures based on series most closely correlated with economic activity, positive uncertainty shocks are mildly expansionary. This result is robust across identification and estimation strategies and is consistent with ""growth options"" theories of the effects of uncertainty.",NA,"https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=eoh&AN=1747535&site=ehost-live","White_2018_essays",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,578

Each chapter looks at a different component of the macroeconomy. In the first chapter I study how empirically observed consumption behavior influences monetary policy transmission into output and prices. I show that extensive margin changes in employment status lead households to consume disproportionately more flexible price goods. In contrast to that, after intensive margin changes of permanent income households consume more sticky prices goods. In a multi-sector New Keynesian model with labor market frictions, non-homothetic preferences and home-production I argue that monetary policy--even if solely interested in price stability--should take into account developments in the labor market and optimally follows a dual mandate in inflation and employment stabilization. In the second chapter I study labor market responses to monetary policy shocks using individual-level microdata. In particular I distinguish between intensive margin responses of hourly wages and hours worked and extensive margin responses of changes in the labor market status. I find that expansionary monetary policy shocks have little effects on hourly wages and hours worked and thus do not influence the intensive margin. However, they have significant extensive margin effects through increasing employment and labor force participation. In the third chapter I empirically investigate how monetary policy during the financial crisis affected firm investment and firm financial outcomes. To that end I examine the floating-rate channel of firm bond-financing and study how the unexpected reduction in policy rates at the onset of the crisis differentially affected firms depending on whether they issued floating-rate or fixed-rate coupon bonds before the crisis.

The core channels of policy transmission — the neoclassical links between short-term policy interest rates, other asset prices such as long-term interest rates, equity prices, and the exchange rate, and the consequent effects on household and business demand — have remained steady from early policy-oriented models (like the Penn-MIT-SSRC MPS model) to modern dynamic, stochastic general equilibrium (DSGE) models. In contrast, non-neoclassical channels, such as credit-based channels, have remained outside the core models. In conjunction with this evolution in theory and modeling, there have been notable changes in policy behavior (with policy more focused on price stability) and in the reduced form correlations of policy interest rates with activity in the United States. Regulatory effects on credit provision have also changed significantly. As a result, we review the empirical evidence on the changes in the effect of monetary policy actions on real activity and inflation and present new evidence, using both a relatively unrestricted factor-augmented vector autoregression (FAVAR) and a DSGE model. Both approaches yield similar results: Monetary policy innovations have a more muted effect on real activity and inflation in recent decades as compared to the effects before 1980. Our analysis suggests that these shifts are accounted for by changes in policy behavior and the effect of these changes on expectations, leaving little role for changes in underlying private-sector behavior (outside shifts related to monetary policy changes).",NA,"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780444532381000089","Boivin_2010_chapter",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,588

It has been argued that the housing market in one country is then important when its mortgage market is well developed. The countries in the euro area follow unitary monetary policy; however, their housing and mortgage markets show some heterogeneity, which may lead to different policy effects on aggregate consumption through the housing market. Design/methodology/approach The housing market can act as a channel of monetary policy shocks to household consumption through changes in house prices and residential investment – the housing market channel. The authors estimate vector autoregressive models for each country and conduct a counterfactual analysis to disentangle the housing market channel and assess its importance across the euro area member states. Findings The authors find little evidence for heterogeneity of the monetary policy transmission through house prices across the euro area countries. Housing market variations in the euro area seem to be better captured by changes in residential investment rather than by changes in house prices. As a result, the authors do not find significantly large house price channels. For some of the countries however, they observe a monetary policy channel through residential investment. The existence of a housing channel may depend on institutional features of both the labour market or with institutional factors capturing the degree of household debt as is the loan-to-value ratio. Originality/value The study contributes to the existing literature by assessing whether a unitary monetary policy has a different impact on consumption across the euro area countries through their housing and mortgage markets. The authors disentangle monetary-policy-induced effects on consumption associated with variations on the housing markets due to either house price variations or residential investment changes. The authors show that the housing market can play a role in the monetary transmission mechanism even in countries with less developed mortgage markets through variations in residential investment.","10.1108/JERER-02-2015-0009","https://doi.org/10.1108/JERER-02-2015-0009","Milcheva_2016_the",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,592

We analyze the effects of four shocks on Turkish economy: two domestic shocks of interest rates and risk premium, and two external shocks of commodity prices and global demand. All shocks are found to have significant effects on main economic variables. Positive interest rate shocks appreciate the domestic currency and decrease the inflation whereas positive risk premium shocks cause a depreciation and an increase in inflation. Both of these shocks also cause a decrease in the domestic activity. Being an open and internationally integrated economy, Turkey is significantly affected by global shocks.

In particular, our framework features a sectorial decomposition of the productive sector, the use of intermediate inputs, imperfect pass-through, endogenous premium to finance capital accumulation, balance sheets effects due to liability dollarization, currency substitution, and price and wage rigidities. Additionally, eleven driving forces, both of domestic and international origin, are considered. While the recent literature has significantly improved our understanding of why these features are important for monetary policy, the relevance of any policy-related study strongly depends on whether the specific model (and its parameterization) used to draw recommendations is empirically sound or not. This argument is particularly relevant for these studies for several reasons. First, this line of research usually applies calibration techniques to assign values for the relevant parameters, many times using as reference studies from developed countries. Additionally, in spite of how the model is parameterized, these papers do not generally analyze if the model can adequately fit the data. Moreover, given this methodological approach, the question of which of the emerging-countries' frictions are empirically more relevant is not addressed, even though it is of great interest for policy design. Given these empirical concerns, we follow a Bayesian approach to estimate the model using a large data set from Mexico containing almost 30 year of quarterly data. Our goal is to address three main quantitative questions. First, can the estimated model fit the data? Our answer is generally yes, with some caveats. Second, are the estimated parameters similar to those calibrated in policy-related studies? The results show many significant differences, particularly for those describing financial frictions, price stickiness and money demand. Finally, which of the emerging-markets' frictions are more relevant in fitting the data? We found that including intermediate inputs is most relevant, while currency substitution does not seem to play a relevant role. Moreover, the financial accelerator mechanism and liability dollarization are also important. Additionally, we use our preferred specifications to study which of the included driving forces are more important in explaining the data. We found that, while foreign shocks play a non-negligible role (especially export prices), the most important sources of fluctuations have a domestic origin. In particular, sectorial (stationary) technology shocks account for more than 40% of the variance of most domestic observables. Country premium disturbances are also relevant to explain real variables, while shocks related with monetary policy shocks are mostly helpful in describing the dynamics of inflation. From a methodological perspective, we depart from the usual implementation of Bayesian estimation of DSGE models in two aspects. First, we modify the methodology proposed by Del Negro and Schorfheide (2006) to assign priors for the estimated parameters, providing a more transparent procedure of translating our a priori beliefs into a probability density (particularly for parameters describing driving forces). Second, in addition to the usual model comparison using the marginal likelihood, we perform a more thorough analysis by applying the loss function-based approach developed by Schorfheide (2000), which allows ranking models according to their ability to fit the data in many different dimensions.",NA,"https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=eoh&AN=1075564&site=ehost-live","Garcia Cicco_2009_estimating",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,599

The analysis covers both WPI and CPI-IW measures of inflation along with their component food inflation. The study uses cointegration approach to identify the determinants of inflation in India. Empirical estimates of the study show that there is a long-run relationship between inflation and its determinants that include expected inflation, output gap, rate of growth of money supply, exchange rate, interest rate, fiscal deficit, minimum support prices, rainfall international oil and food prices. These determinants also Granger cause both the measures of inflation. The normalised generalised variance decompositions suggest that determinants of inflation, in descending order of importance include expected inflation, exchange rate, rate of growth of money supply and output gap and least variation in them is explained by interest rates. This analysis is found to be similar for both the measures of inflation. Thus demand factors such as exchange rate, rate of growth in money supply and output gap explain significant variation in both the measures. On the supply side global factors like international oil and food prices play a key role in determining both overall and food inflation in the economy. This has important policy implications in the light of new monetary framework where flexible inflation targeting is adopted by the central bank. Inflation management will become a more challenging task as inflation is also significantly determined by the supply side variables.

Under a fixed exchange rate system, inflation in Bangladesh was moderately high and volatile during the 1950s and 1960s. Since the country’s independence from Pakistan in 1971, inflation in Bangladesh has remained moderately high on average and highly volatile and persistent under a fixed-pegged exchange rate system or under a managed floating system since 2003. Using data from the early 1970s or earlier depending on data availability, the article undertakes both Granger-causality and the structural vector autoregression (SVAR) analysis with two models. The first model is comprised of such variables as inflation, the real interest rate, the real exchange rate and output growth, and the second model is comprised of the volatilities of money growth, real output growth and inflation. Then, based on the empirical findings, the article concludes that a rule-based monetary policy, namely monetary targeting or inflation targeting, remains appropriate for Bangladesh provided that it adopts a more flexible, if not freely floating, exchange rate system. The article suggests that the use of monetary policy to achieve multiple objectives under a fixed-pegged exchange rate system creates a time-inconsistency problem, reduces monetary policy credibility and makes it (monetary policy) ineffective in lowering inflation and its volatility. Low credibility of monetary policy in particular raises inflation persistence. Within the present monetary-policy framework in Bangladesh, the article illustrates how the fixed-pegged exchange rate system has generated money growth volatility in the presence of large-scale inflows of overseas workers’ remittances and readymade garments export earnings. This does not seem to be a concern of the central bank of Bangladesh (Bangladesh Bank); rather, it (Bangladesh Bank) pursues monetary-base targeting to keep inflation low and stable after considering economic growth. The consequent diminishing credibility of monetary policy has kept inflation volatile and persistent, which has adversely affected economic growth.","10.1080/00036846.2015.1054074","https://doi.org/10.1080/00036846.2015.1054074","Hossain_2015_inflation",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,612

As a result, monetary policy has a countervailing effect on the employment concentration in large firms. (ii) There is an asymmetry in the effects of monetary contractions versus expansions with respect to firms' employment and hiring growth. Not accounting for such asymmetry leads to the fallacious conclusion that small firms respond more than large firms to monetary policy shocks.

(iii) The response of employment is weaker than that of hiring, highlighting the importance of using labor market flows.

We first show that it is possible to use more efficiently the available information when identifying monetary policy shocks. Using together quarterly series for GDP and monthly series for monetary aggregates and interest rates, it is possible to identify monetary shocks with the assumption that they do not have any impact on GDP within a month, by restricting ourselves to the identification of third-month-of-a-quarter shocks. With this new method, we obtain very similar estimated IRFs, as compared with the results obtained with quarterly data, although the price puzzle appears to be more pronounced in our estimates. Such a similarity is a new fact that quantitative models need to match.

I uncover that regional risk is strongly countercyclical: the conditional standard deviation of idiosyncratic shocks to U.S. state-level output growth is estimated to be 40% larger in NBER recessions than in normal times. However, the extent to which regions insure against these risks has not varied much over the business cycle. I argue that federal fiscal transfers that operate in a ""state-contingent"" manner during recessions can reconcile these results. To understand what these patterns of regional risk and fiscal integration imply for the aggregate, I build a New Keynesian model of heterogeneous regions with an incomplete asset market. The calibrated model suggests that during an economic downturn, increased regional risk worsens risk sharing, due to more regions being constrained at the borrowing limit; meanwhile, it amplifies the impact of aggregate productivity shocks, due to stronger precautionary saving motives leading to lower aggregate demand. However, state-contingent federal government transfers stabilize both the regional and aggregate economy, by providing insurance to the regions that need it the most--those with low productivities and high marginal propensities to consume. Taken together, this paper demonstrates the power of regional redistributive policies as automatic stabilizers in a fiscal union. Chapter 2: A Quarterly Dataset of US State-Level Aggregates: To build a balanced panel of state-level aggregates at the quarterly frequency that dates back to 1960s, we develop a Mixed-Frequency Bayesian Estimation method to deal with the existing state-level macroeconomic data that feature: time-varying frequency (e.g. GDP), mixed frequencies across variables, short sample (e.g. unemployment), and measurement errors (e.g. consumption). We confirm the precision of our estimated panel with multiple tests, and discuss its potential applications.

In addition, less capital-intensive states have larger responses to corporate tax cuts.

The first chapter, ""Monetary Policy Rules and Macroeconomic Stability Revisited: Limited Information Approach under Identifying Restrictions,"" provides a new approach to limited information estimation consistent with the forward-looking monetary policy rule. Recently, the weak identification in the conventional estimation method has drawn attention to the estimation of a forward-looking monetary policy rule. This paper identified a particular range for the value of the concentration parameter, for which the generalized method of moments (GMM) suffers from the weak identification problem, while the proposed method does not. This implies that GMM estimation generates spurious weak identification in the estimation of a forward-looking monetary policy rule. The proposed approach allows us to provide stronger messages to the estimation of a forward-looking monetary policy rule. The estimation results confirm a change of monetary policy in the U.S. In the 1960-1979 sample, the policy was inactive and it did not react sufficiently to the expected deviation of inflation from its target. In contrast, under the 1979-1997 sample monetary policy actively responses to the inflation with a high degree of interest smoothing. The second chapter of the dissertation is the extension of the first chapter, ""Estimation of a Time-varying Forward-looking Monetary Policy Rule: Limited Information Approach."" In this chapter, I estimate a time-varying forward-looking monetary policy rule by considering a time-varying structural vector auto-regression (VAR) model for the monetary transition mechanism. Assuming that the time variation comes from the coefficients and the variance covariance matrix, I illustrate this via modeling multivariate stochastic volatility. In a foundational paper, Primiceri (2005) estimated a time-varying structural VAR with stochastic volatility after assuming monetary policy shocks to be independent of any other innovations without forward-looking variables. Because agents are assumed to be rational, monetary policy changes can be incorporated into future forecasts. Kim and Nelson (2006) used a single equation to investigate the estimation of a forward-looking monetary policy rule in relation to the forward-looking behavior of agents. To account for the endogeneity, they suggested a two-step estimation technique based on the control function approach. However, as Chon and Kim (2014) argued, the error term in instrumenting equations for forward-looking variables follows moving-average (MA) dynamics, resulting in additional information loss. Consequently, this paper illustrates that one can recover this MA structure after considering the reduced-form of the time-varying VAR; the procedure suggested in this paper resolves the possible weak identification issues. The third chapter of the dissertation is ""Stock Market Reaction to Monetary Policy Changes: Identification through Heteroskedasticity with Markov-switching."" This paper investigates the estimation issues surrounding the response of asset prices to monetary policy changes. Because of the simultaneous relationship between stock prices and policy decisions, and because both react to numerous other variables, estimation of the impact of stock price to monetary policy action is difficult. In this paper, I use the heteroskedastic structure of monetary policy shocks to identify stock market reactions to monetary policy changes following Rigobon and Sack (2004). Especially, in order to consider all possible sources which affect shifts in monetary policy shocks, such as the alteration of expectations about the future path of the monetary policy and a change in the timing of policy moves, I incorporate the Markov-switching framework to detect different state endogenously. The procedure proposed in this paper can reduce the potential bias caused by misspecified timings in the shifts of monetary policy shocks and produce more precise estimate of the monetary policy actions on the stock market. Since the stock market is forward-looking, I focus on the surprised part of the policy actions within the conventional event-study framework. The empirical finding tells us that the heteroskedasticity on event day may well be a consequence of the asymmetric effects on the different types of policy actions: expansionary policy vs. contractionary policy. Also, we found that the unanticipated 25-basis point increase would decrease 1.91 percent in the S&P 500 returns.",NA,"https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=eoh&AN=1538270&site=ehost-live","Chon_2015_estimation",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,649

Inflation volatility is measured by conditional variance generated by fitting an empirical Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Hetroskedasticity (GARCH) model to a seasonally adjusted annualized quarterly consumer price inflation for the period 1960Q1-2013Q3. The volatility measure, together with macroeconomic control variables, was used to estimate economic growth models for two periods corresponding to two monetary policy regimes and a third period covering the full sample. The first period corresponds to the pre-inflation targeting regime covering 1960Q1-1998Q4. During this period, the country had adopted various monetary policy frameworks including exchange-rate targeting, discretionary monetary policy, monetary-aggregate targeting and an eclectic approach. This period was largely characterized by high and more volatile inflation. The inflation volatility in turn had statistically significant negative impact on economic growth during this period. Nonetheless, inflation volatility did not have statistically significant impact on real economic growth during the inflation targeting monetary policy period, i.e. 2000Q1-2013Q3. The empirical results for the combined growth model are consistent with the findings for the two periods. The implication of this is that by adopting the inflation targeting monetary policy framework since 2000, South Africa has succeeded in achieving low and stable general price level thereby creating a conducive environment for economic growth. The higher growth period of the mid 2000s followed the introduction of inflation targeting monetary policy regime. Nevertheless, higher Sacrifice Ratio of disinflation and entrenched structural bottlenecks continue to undermine growth and stifle the spillover effects from low and stable inflation to real economic activities.

In particular, I propose and quantify a novel channel to explain how population aging might affect the effectiveness of monetary policy and the flattening of the Phillips curve: older individuals purchase more from product categories with higher levels of price rigidity--categories which adjust their prices less often--so the aggregate frequency of price adjustment decreases as the population ages. Using micro data on consumer expenditure, I document the negative relationship between age and the frequency of price adjustment and find that it is mainly due to the higher share of services consumed by old households. At the macro level, if prices are more rigid output should respond more to monetary shocks. To test this hypothesis, I exploit the cross-sectional variation in demographic structures across the U.S. and I show that the economic activity in states with a higher old-age dependency ratio reacts more to monetary shocks. Finally, I rationalise these findings using a two-sector OLG New Keynesian model where demographic trends shift aggregate demand towards services, i.e., the stickier expenditure category. Combining the model with population projections for the U.S., I find that the changes in the age distribution between 1980 and 2010 increased the contemporaneous response of output to monetary shocks by 6% and will have increased it by 10% in 2050.

Some statistics are used to characterise the state of the economies from the backdrop of the 1970's up till recently. Major historical events, like the OPEC oil shocks and the ERM crisis, along with narrative evidence, are then used as a guide to identify ""monetary policy periods"", which reflect the stance of monetary policy at central banks during those events. The significance of these monetary policy periods are then assessed using an instrumental variables approach. The results find the policy periods to be significant in the majority of the countries. Chapter II: This paper examines the transmission mechanism of monetary policy within NNS models in terms of implications for movements in money market and implied CCAPM rates observed within six of the G7 countries. This chapter adopts the Christiano, Eichenbaum & Evans (1999) approach to identifying monetary policy shocks using vector autoregressions in NNS models with power utility and with habit. VAR's are used to trace out the dynamic responses of consumption, inflation and output arising from an exogenous monetary policy shock. These exhibit the typical hump-shaped responses observed in the literature. The results suggest that the movements of these two rates, as implied by the transmission mechanism of monetary policy in NNS models, are inconsistent and cannot be reconciled through the consumption Euler equation. Furthermore, they suggest that the puzzle may be resolved by de-linking real interest rates and consumption growth. Chapter: The transmission mechanism of monetary policy in NNS models predict that real interest rates and expected consumption growth should be perfectly correlated. The empirical literature on monetary policy documents a ""hump-shaped"" response of aggregate consumption to a monetary policy action, and finds the correlation between real interest rates and expected consumption growth to be low, and often negative.

The first chapter examines the relative information content of Divisia measures of money and interest rates in explaining key macroeconomic variations and provides a comparison between narrow and broad Divisia measures of money. Using three classes of empirical models, and monthly data from 1967 to 2018, the chapter shows that broad Divisia money measures are weakly procyclical and relatively more informative for predicting economic activities than the acyclical narrow money measures. Together with a SVAR-GARCH (1,1) analysis, the chapter concludes that broad Divisia monetary aggregates are superior to their narrow counterparts in terms of their ability to predict real economic activities and to transmit shocks within the US economy. The second chapter provides a comparative analysis of the relative importance of uncertainty, monetary policy, and leverage shocks in affecting business cycle fluctuations. According to the information-based monetary misperceptions model, monetary shocks are a principal source of business cycles. Recently, some researchers have alluded to uncertainty shocks as alternative drivers of business cycle fluctuations. This chapter assesses the predictive ability of various risk/uncertainty measures in predicting real economic activities and finds that the macroeconomic uncertainty index and the Chicago Fed national financial conditions risk index have the strongest predictive relationship with the economy. Using a penalty function approach to identify three shocks, the chapter concludes that uncertainty shocks are a relatively more important source of variations in the economy than traditional monetary policy shocks. However, monetary policy shocks still outperform uncertainty shocks in explaining inflation dynamics. The final chapter focuses on the role of money supply and leverage in monetary policy and business cycle analysis. Both leverage and the money supply affect the level of economic activity and the business cycle. Yet these variables are mostly not directly considered as key variables in recent monetary and business cycle analyses. Augmenting the standard Taylor-type reaction function of the central bank with measures of money and leverage, this chapter provides a comprehensive comparison of the effects of monetary policy shocks in an economy where the reaction function follows the standard Taylor rule and one that augments it with money and leverage. The identification is based on sign restrictions and other useful prior information of the researcher.

Specifically, the study evaluate the effect of monetary policy rate on manufacturing sector output in Nigeria, examine the effect of treasury bill rate on manufacturing sector output in Nigeria, access the effect of cash reserve ratio on manufacturing sector output in Nigeria and to investigate the effect of money supply on manufacturing sector output in Nigeria. Time series data covering 33 years, from 1987 to 2019 was employed. Descriptive statistics were used to explain the nature of the variables used for the analyses.

Our findings among others revealed that money supply; monetary policy rate and treasury bill rate have positive significant policy effects on manufacturing sector output in Nigerian while cash reserve ratio had negative and insignificant policy effect on manufacturing sector output in Nigeria. The study therefore concludes that monetary policies have positive and significant effect on manufacturing sector output in Nigeria.

In Europe, much of the interest in the effects of monetary policy is arguably a reflection of the introduction of the single currency: to the extent that transmission mechanism differ significantly across euro area countries, heterogenous responses of economic activity and prices to the policy instrument should be expected, an occurrence whose policy implications are of major relevance. To gain some insight into the likely causes of those differences recent studies have attempted to identify and assess separately the channels of transmission of monetary policy. This paper proposes a simple methodology to quantify separately the different parts of the overall impulse response that are transmitted through the various mechanisms at play in a model of the economy. It is shown that, under the maintained assumption of linearity, the decomposition of the effects of monetary policy into a number of channels delivered by our approach is exact (i.e., it leaves no unexplained residual). This conclusion holds regardless of the nature of the expectation formation mechanism and the way in which policy decisions are modelled. The features of the proposed approach are illustrated with an empirical application, using a model that features two distinct transmission channels and assumes rational expectations and a monetary policy reaction rule. We show that our approach produces an exact decomposition of the effects of a monetary policy shock.

We claim that China went through a monetary dominant regime from 1996Q to 2017Q4 since the response of CPI to a fiscal expansion was negative in the short run and about zero in the long run, while the monetary expansion had positive effects on CPI. During this period, the response of government spending and money supply to each other’s shock had the same sign, indicating that the two policies acted as complements. However, we argue that 2008Q4 was a turning point that divided this period into two different periods. The response level of M2 growth rate to a fiscal expansion kept rising from 1996Q1 to 2008Q4, indicating the central bank’s increasingly active cooperation with fiscal policy, while it decreased from 2009Q1 to 2017Q4. Since 2018Q1, the economy has been going through a fiscal dominant regime in that the response of GDP growth rate and CPI to the fiscal expansion has sharply increased. We also argue that the relative change of the role between the two policies should be mainly attributed to the variation in the fiscal authority’s characteristics because fiscal response to a monetary shock has remained at a similar level the whole time, even if there have been changes in the characteristics of the central bank.","10.3390/jrfm14090416","https://www.mdpi.com/1911-8074/14/9/416","Luan_2021_understanding",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,688

The Cointegration method is employed in the analysis of the data gathered with the aid of E-Views on the model consisting of exchange rate, interest rate, broad money supply and inflation as the exogenous variable while Gross Domestic Product is the endogenous variables. The findings indicate that monetary policy instrument (exchange rate) has a positive impact on the Gross Domestic Product by playing a crucial role in the increase in productivity for the 29 years span period and inflation, broad money supply, interest rate have negative impact on Gross Domestic Product. The study recommends that the monetary policy authorities and other financial regulatory body have to come up with possible solution that can help in addressing the long time negative influence of inflation, broad money supply and interest rate on economic growth.

To address the issue we use a single-equation approach where unanticipated changes in the federal funds rate are measured as residuals from policy reaction functions. We also estimate VAR specifications, which incorporate information about the timing of changes in the Federal Reserve's target federal funds rate. Our single-equation estimates provide evidence of strong responses of long rates to unanticipated changes in the federal funds rate both for the Greenspan period and for a longer period back to the mid-1960s.

The analyses entailed the computation of the various coefficients of correlation denoted as in the model to determine the effectiveness of monetary policy tools in countering inflation in Kenya. The study established that inflation and the money supply were positively correlate with each other. As money supply circulating around the economy increases inflation also increases. An increase in money supply leads to people spending the excess of their money supply over money demand. The study also established that exchange rate policyhas an important role in reducing or minimizing the risk of fluctuations in exchange rates, which will have an impact on the economy. Any changes in exchange rates will have a great impact on the economy. The study recommends that the policy makers need to keenly consider the levels of money supply in Kenya so as to ensure a stable retail price levels.

This evidence has been viewed as supportive of a ""Fed information effect"" channel of monetary policy, whereby an FOMC tightening (easing) communicates that the economy is stronger (weaker) than the public had expected. We show that these empirical results are also consistent with a ""Fed response to news"" channel, in which incoming, publicly available economic news causes both the Fed to change monetary policy and the private sector to revise its forecasts. We provide substantial new evidence that distinguishes between these two channels and strongly favors the latter; for example, (i) high-frequency stock market responses to Fed announcements, (ii) a new survey that we conduct of individual Blue Chip forecasters, and (iii) regressions that include the previously omitted public macroeconomic data releases all indicate that the Fed and Blue Chip forecasters are simply responding to the same public news, and that there is little if any role for a ""Fed information effect"".",NA,"https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=eoh&AN=1825385&site=ehost-live","Bauer_2020_the",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,701

For instance, does a multi sector model in which the frequency of price changes differs among sectors predict radically different dynamics for aggregate variables following a monetary policy shock than a one-sector model in which sectors are assumed to be homogenous in their frequencies of price changes? Is there any relative price effect of the shocks to monetary policy? If there is, can this relative price effect be related to the heterogeneity of the frequency of price changes among sectors? What insights can be gained if dynamic stochastic open-economy models are elaborated by including the heterogeneity of price flexibility among sectors? These questions are among the types of the questions that I address in this thesis. This thesis consists of three papers. The first paper studies the effects of a monetary policy shock on output, inflation and the real-wage in the United States. Next, the dynamics of these aggregate variables as predicted by the one- and multi-sector dynamic stochastic general equilibrium (DSGE) models are compared. The main finding is that the dynamics as predicted by the multi-sector model are quite similar to those as predicted by the one-sector model. The second paper focuses mostly on the effects of shocks to the federal funds rate on disaggregated sectors' prices in the United States. The two main empirical findings in this chapter are the substantial heterogeneity in sectoral price responses to the shock and that the price responses in sectors are only weakly associated with their frequency of price changes. The third paper, jointly written with Emek Karaca, is concerned with the effects of positive monetary shocks on output, the real exchange rate and the price level in developing countries which have adopted an inflation targeting regime. We find that such shocks are associated with a temporary rise in output; a temporary depreciation in the real exchange rate and a sizable contemporaneous increase in the price level in those economies.",NA,"https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=eoh&AN=1470812&site=ehost-live","Tugan_2014_three",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,706

The empirical evidence suggests that a U.S. monetary contraction leads to an immediate rise in the broad commodity price index, which possibly reflects an aggregation bias, greater expected inflation and speculation, high production costs or some overshooting due to overreactions. Then, the response erodes after six quarters as the positive interest rate shock vanishes and higher interest rates and liquidity drainage take traction. Despite this, the aggregate price response masks the existence of significant heterogeneity in the price responses of the different types of commodity sectors. More specifically, a positive interest rate shock leads to: (i) an initial pop in the price returns of the non-fuel commodities, which later reverses path and becomes negative (as in the case of the prices of agricultural raw materials); (ii) a positive and persistent rise in the volatile food prices; (iii) a fall in the beverage prices; and (iv) a persistent reduction in the prices of metals and the prices of energy prices. Our results also remain globally intact with respect to alternative specifications and identification schemes as well as to unconventional monetary policy effects. Similar results are also found when commodity futures prices are used.

We propose a multi-quantile version of the Generalized Method of Moments using the Laplace-type estimator. The empirical findings support the canonical NKPC with larger coefficients for marginal cost and expected inflation in the upper quantiles of the inflation distribution, while the hybrid NKPC fits better with the mid and lower quantiles. Accordingly, the risk of high inflation, measured by the right side tail of the conditional density, is more responsive to a change in expected inflation compared with the center and the left side. These results imply that monetary policy affects the future path of inflation in an asymmetric way, such that a tightening of monetary policy reduces high-inflation risks more than what we expect based on the point path, whereas the effect of expansionary policy on downside risk is minor. We also perform structural break tests and find that the model is unstable through 1983. There is a moderate change in the post-break data such that the downside risk of inflation becomes less responsive to expected inflation, which may reduce the cost of contractionary monetary policy.","10.1016/j.econmod.2016.02.002","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S026499931630013X","Lee_2016_the",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,711

However, the combination and harmonization of both monetary and fiscal policy are highly recommended.",NA,"https://papers.ssrn.com/abstract=3304047","Saqib_2017_impact",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,724

Second, the transmission to GDP growth has increased in OECD countries since the early 1980s. We also detect a more depressed GDP over medium term in the U.S., Canada, Japan, Australia, Norway and Sweden over the recent global financial crisis. Third, the size of U.S. monetary policy shocks during financial turmoil periods were unusual than normal periods and varies overtime. The financial crisis (2008–2009) is evidenced by decline in residential investment in the U.S. and propagation of this shock to Canada, Germany, Japan, Switzerland and New Zealand over the recent period. U.S. monetary policy shocks reduce share prices in most of the OECD countries; this impact is more pronounced over the turmoil period. Asset prices, interest rates and trade channel seem to play major role in propagation of monetary policy shocks.","10.1016/j.econmod.2012.07.020","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264999312002532","Kazi_2013_the",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,725

First, monetary policy induced-movements in house prices translate into consumption changes because of wealth eﬀects. Second, a contractionary monetary shock raises the cost of borrowing which reduces the demand and as a result the liquidity of the housing market, further depressing house prices and further increases the cost of borrowing. Furthermore, nominal long-term mortgage debt implies that changes in monetary policy result in redistribution between lenders and borrowers and generate cash-ﬂow eﬀects that are larger for borrowing constrained households. We build a heterogenous agent New Keynesian model with a frictional housing market to quantify the various mechanisms. The model is able to match the rich empirical heterogeneity in home ownership, leverage and MPC across households. In particular, our model is consistent with the signiﬁcant difference in MPC between low- and high-LTV households that we document in the data.

Second, we ﬁnd asymmetric responses of the economy to shocks, with contractionary shocks yielding a larger response of all variables.

Whilst inflation has been curtailed to single digit figures since the economic crisis of the 1970s, nevertheless, in the recent past, inflation volatility and unemployment have constrained Uganda’s growth outlook. Like many various developing countries, Uganda has interacted monetary and fiscal policy frameworks as macroeconomic tools to spur productive growth. Most developing countries like Uganda continue to grapple with the challenges of jobless growth which is largely attributed to unstable inflationary pressures as well as low investment which further eggravated rapid expansion in unemployment levels. Government policy efforts have recently been greatly inhibited by rising youth unemployment rates in the country, this has greatly affected Uganda’s growth dynamics. Whilst developed countries have successfully used monetary and fiscal policy frameworks in their pursuit to macroeconomic stability, due to their complex structural economic dynamics, low income countries face challenges in implementing both monetary and fiscal policy to stabilize their economies. Central banks across all countries strive for low and predictable inflation as key in fostering economic growth. The debate over the applicability between monetary and fiscal policy frameworks in the pursuit of enhanced growth continues among policy analysts. The general observation especially in low income countries pertains to the use and effective coordination of monetary and fiscal policy in efforts to stabilize these economies. Despite numerous public expenditure reforms implemented and decline in poverty levels in Uganda, unemployment continued to rise over the past decade consequently inhibiting the country’s growth prospects which has ultimately undermined the econoimy’s capacity to external shocks. Keynes and the monetarists ignited the contentious debate over the superiority between monetary and fiscal policy frameworks which has transformed macroeconomic policy application. A conducive private sector environment as well as large expansions of infrastructure are key fundamental aspects of the development strategy in developing countries, they enhance growth in per capita income. Whilst the monetary authority emphasizes price stability when formulating policies, the fiscal authority pursues its objectives accommodative of the underlying circumstances in the economy. This study aimed to establish an econometric model to predict the impact of monetary and fiscal policy on unemployment and inflation in Uganda using annual time series data for the period 1980 to 2013. The study sought to investigate the influence of monetary and fiscal policy variables on the Ugandan economy in relation to unemployment and inflation. The analysis in the study is based on a twofold oriented objective. The first objective was to investigate monetary and fiscal policy dynamics in Uganda in relation to unemployment. The second objective examined the conduct of monetary and fiscal policy framework on inflation in Uganda. The study analysis begins with a review of literature on the various monetarists and Keynesian theories in relation to the underlying monetary and fiscal policy frameworks. Considering the analysis was a twofold objective, two empirical models linked to unemployment and inflation as well as their relative determinants are specified. The Empirical literature review examined in the study is based on various monetary and fiscal policy theories as well as empirical works by Keynesians, classical economists and the Friedman views. The time series data used were obtained from published sources of the World Bank and IMF, the Uganda Bureau of Statistics (UBOS), Ministry of Finance, Planning and Economic Development (MoFPED) statistical reports and annual statistical drafts from the Uganda Revenue Authority (URA) and Bank of Uganda (BOU). To empirically investigate the influence of monetary and fiscal policy variables on unemployment and inflation in Uganda, considering the use of two dependent variables i. e unemployment and inflation, hence, two estimation techniques were applied in the study namely; the Modified Ordinary Least Squares that comprise of FMOLS and DOLS and the Autoregressive Distributed Lag (ARDL) approach. The estimation analysis in the study contains two main parts which are spread over two chapters. The first part of the analysis deals with the effects of fiscal and monetary policy on unemployment. The estimation techniques applied in the study included the Fully Modified Ordinary Least Squares (FMOLS) and Dynamic Ordinary Least Squares (DOLS) applied to a Vector Autoregressive (VAR) model. The analysis regressed monetary and fiscal policy aggregates on unemployment in a twofold objective. The first sub section regressed fiscal policy aggregates on unemployment using; total government expenditure, total government revenue, tax revenue and trade openness on unemployment using both FMOLS and DOLS techniques. The second sub-section regressed monetary policy on unemployment using; interest rates, money supply, real effective exchange rates and inflation being regressed against unemployment. To test for presence of unit root among the variables of the sample period of 1980 to 2013, the study employed three approaches; i.e. the Augmented Dickey Fuller (ADF) test, Phillips-Perron (PP) test and Kwiatkowski–Phillips–Schmidt–Shin (KPSS) test. Included in this analysis is the test for structural breaks to further determine stationarity in the data series. The results revealed the presence of structural breaks. Structural breaks tend to inhibit stationarity among the variables at levels. However, when presence of structural breaks is taken into consideration, it simplifies empirical estimation analysis under review. The Johansen Cointegration approach was further applied to establish existence of a stable long-run relationship between monetary policy and fiscal policy as well as their respective variables included in the model in relation to unemployment, this further entailed estimation of FMOLS and DOLS in the model estimation analysis. The results from the above analysys show a negative and statistically significant relationship between total government expenditure (LGOVTEXP) and unemployment (LUNEMPLOYMENT). However, tax revenue, trade openness as well structural reforms which denotes the (SB) coefficient all show a positive and significant relationship with unemployment. Additionally, total government revenue (LGOVTREV) shows a negative relationship with unemployment although statistically insignificant. The DOLS results in this analysis all show statistically insignificant results between all the variables and unemployment. The second subsection using DOLS, analysed the impact of monetary policy on unemployment, revealed a negative and significant relation between interest rates, real exchange rates and structural reforms (SB) with unemployment. Money supply indicates a negative but statistically insignificant relationship with unemployment. However, inflation has a positive and statistically significant relationship with unemployment. The normality tests conducted indicate normal distribution of the residuals. Similiraly, the AR inverse roots show stability of the models estimated whilst the multi-collinearity and Wald tests all showed unbiased estimation results. Having analysed the effects of fiscal and monetary policy on unemployment the interest was to further test the impact of fiscal and monetary policy on inflation. This part constitutes two sub-sections. The ARDL approach ws used to analyse the influence of fiscal policy on inflation. The results reveal a negative and statistically significant relationship between inflation (DLINF) and total government expenditure (DLGOVTEXP) both lagged twice. Similiraly, total government revenue (DLGOVTREV) and tax revenue (DLTAXREV) both lagged once indicate a negative and statistically significant relationship with inflation. However, unemployment lagged three times indicates a negative and statistically insignificant relationship with inflation whilst trade openness lagged three times has a positive and satatistically significant relationship with inflation. The Granger causality test results revealed among all the fiscal policy aggregates used, only inflation Granger causes total government revenue. The second part on the effects of fiscal and monetary policy on inflation used monetary variables; interest rates (DLINT), money supply (DLMS) and real exchange rates (DLREER). The ARDL results revealed all coefficients to have positive signs. Inflation and real exchange rates lagged five and four times respectively have a positive and significant relationship with the dependent variable of inflation. However, interest rate and money supply lagged five and three times respectively show a positive and statistically insignificant relationship with inflation. The estimated model showed no evidence of presence of serial correlation through numerous diagnostic tests performed. These include; heteroscedasticity, residual normality and misspecification tests as well as the Cusum stability tests. Under the analysis of monetary policy dynamics on inflation, the Granger causality test revealed that inflation Granger causes interest rates. Similiraly, real exchange rate Granger causes inflation. The ARDL results in this sub-section suggest that inflation regressed against its own lagged values is statistically significant in explaining variations on inflation. Further, interest rates, money supply and real exchange rates significantly explain variations in inflation during the period under review. The results from the above analysis suggest that firstly, the fiscal authority in Uganda should formulate dynamic as well as robust fiscal reforms that can effeficiently be coordinated with sound monetary policy reforms. This ought to stimulate meaningful economic growth in the economy which would further enhance employment growth. Secondly, policy authorities should implement macroeconomic policies which harmonise public spending whilst at the same keep inflation subdued. In this regard, inflation targeting policies should be strengthened. Thirdly, the macroeconomic policy framework in Uganda should be coordinated with strong employment targeting policies in an effort to broaden labour market dynamics.",NA,"https://vital.seals.ac.za/vital/access/manager/Repository/vital:27899?site_name=GlobalView","Sebuliba_2017_monetary",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,736

We find interest rate and lending channels to be operative in South Africa. For the interest rate channel, a percentage restriction in monetary policy increases lending rate by 0.29%; a percentage increase in the lending rate reduces investment by 0.063%; and a percentage fall in investment reduces inflation by 0.074%. For the lending channel, a percentage restriction of monetary policy reduces banking sector credit by 0.22%; a percentage fall in private sector credit reduces investment by 0.20%; and a percentage decline in investment reduces inflation by 0.086%.

Based on an estimated New-Keynesian model in which the only source of change is the move from passive to active monetary policy, we show that VARs may misinterpret good policy for good luck. First, the policy shift is sufficient to generate decreases in the theoretical innovation variances for all series, and decreases in the variances of inflation and the output gap, without any need of sunspot shocks. With sunspots, the estimated model exhibits decreases in both variances and innovation variances for all series. Second, policy counterfactuals based on the theoretical structural VAR representations of the model under the two regimes fail to capture the truth, whereas impulse-response functions to a monetary policy shock exhibit little change across regimes.

The stock market, therefore, affects the economy through two channels: through a traditional ""wealth effect"" and through its impact on agents' expectations. Monetary policy decisions also affect and are potentially affected by the stock market.

The results of the recursive VARs are broadly in line with the established empirical findings, especially when the interest rate is considered the monetary policy variable. Following a positive innovation in interest rate, GDP growth and inflation decrease while the exchange rate appreciates. When money growth and exchange rate are used as policy indicators, the impact on GDP growth contrasts with established findings. However, as expected, an exchange rate appreciation has an immediate impact on the reduction of inflation. Interest rate innovations are persistent, supporting the view that the monetary authority adjusts interest rates gradually, while innovations in money growth and exchange rate appreciation are not persistent. Several puzzling results emerge from the study: for most sub-samples, inflation does not decline following a contractionary policy shock; innovations to money growth raises the interest rate; when inflation does respond, it reacts to monetary innovations faster than GDP growth does; and exchange rate appreciations almost always lead to an increase in GDP growth. The results from the semi-structural VARs, which impose identification restrictions only on the policy block, are not different from those obtained from recursive VARs. The results show that none of the sub-samples since 1978 can be identified with a particular targeting regime. In contrast, the interest rate, monetary aggregates and the exchange rate, contain important information in relation to the monetary policy stance. Based on this premise, a monetary policy index is estimated for Sri Lanka. The index displays that unanticipated monetary policy forms a smaller portion of monetary policy action in comparison to anticipated monetary policy. It is also observed that a decline in GDP growth is associated with anticipated policy with a short lag, while reductions in inflation are associated with both anticipated and unanticipated components of monetary policy with a longer lag of 28 to 36 months.",NA,"https://mpra.ub.uni-muenchen.de/64866/","Amarasekara_2008_the",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,747

Using a reduced form model, he shows that the economic situation would have been improved if a more responsive monetary policy had been implemented. In this paper, we set up a two-sector New Keynesian DSGE model, estimated using Bayesian techniques, to evaluate Taylor's hypotheses. We assume a less responsive Taylor rule for the period of study, which allows us to separate the effects of the responsiveness of monetary policy and the effects of monetary shocks caused by other reasons. Our results contradict Taylor's hypothesis, that a less responsible monetary policy aggravated the housing boom. Instead, we find that monetary policy played a minor role. We do find, however, that a more responsive monetary policy may have stabilized housing prices during the transition period of 2004-2008, the period of the boom to the bust. Moreover, a more responsive monetary policy would have generated smaller responses of the real variables to shocks, except for the technology shock in the housing sector. One of the differences with the literature is that we introduce housing market segmentation through different discount factors, leading to a housing market that is occupied only by constrained (impatient) households. The impulse responses to monetary policy shocks and cost push shocks under this assumption deliver unconventional results. In particular, a contractionary monetary policy shock and a positive cost push shock will bring down the interest rate and inflation respectively. Moreover, the real housing price is reduced with these two shocks, leading to more binding constraints for the impatient households. To clear the housing market, the interest rate is reduced, automatically taxing patient lenders and subsidizing impatient borrowers. The theoretical variance decomposition indicates that the monetary shock explains about 21% of the variances in housing prices and the cost push shock explains about 63%, while the variance in the housing output is mainly explained by the technology shock in housing sector. Our conclusion is that monetary policy shocks, rather than the responsiveness of monetary policy, contributed to the housing boom, but with limited effect.",NA,"https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=eoh&AN=1538385&site=ehost-live","Zhang_2014_the",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,749

Financial shocks are identified by imposing a recursive structure (Choleski decomposition). Several results stand out. First, the effect of financial shocks on the real economy is fairly heterogeneous across countries, confirming previous findings in the literature. Second, the five financial shocks provide a surprisingly large contribution to explaining real fluctuations (33% of GDP variance at the 3-year horizon on average across countries) exceeding the contribution from monetary policy shocks. Third, the most important source of real fluctuations appears to be shocks to asset prices (real stock prices account for 12% of GDP variance and real house prices for 9%). Shocks to the term spread or to leverage (credit-to-GDP ratio or loans-to-deposits ratio) each contribute an additional 3-4% of GDP variance. Fourth, the combined contribution of the five financial shocks is usually higher for fluctuations in investment than in private consumption. Fifth, historical decompositions indicate that financial shocks provide much more important contributions to output fluctuations during episodes associated with financial imbalances (both booms and busts).

Emerging market economies are structurally different from advanced economies as they are generally associated with greater financial frictions, underdeveloped financial markets, as well as both a high average level and unequal access to dollarized assets, among others. Thus, the study on the impact of monetary policy in emerging economies requires additional specifications. The first essay investigates the distributional consequences of monetary policy in the context of a small open economy framework. I show that wealthy households (represented by the top ten percent of the income distribution), who are more able to save in foreign currencies, gain in purchasing power of their incomes by hedging against domestic inflation. At the same time, since the poor (represented by the bottom fifty percent of the income distribution) retain larger share of liquid assets denominated in domestic currency, consequently leading them to bear a greater burden of local currency inflation. I also show that contractionary monetary policy is associated with periods of higher income inequality in emerging markets. The second essay presents a comprehensive practical analysis of Kazakhstani city-level housing prices. The key focus is to test whether there is a single, integrated Kazakhstani housing market, and hence to examine potential long-run relationships among the seven city housing prices series for which we have monthly data during the period 2014-2017. We also explore how monetary policy shifts and subsequent exchange rate shocks could affect the system of relative prices. The results obtained suggest that city-level house prices are weakly related across cities in the long run, and the interest rate channel of monetary policy currently is surprisingly weak in Kazakhstan. The third essay discusses a relatively new take on Inflation Targeting as a single-mandate monetary policy, which effectively exposes its many disadvantages. Our discussion first introduces the issues of coordination and conflict between fiscal and monetary policies. Our empirical exercise directly addresses the unemployment outcome of inflation targeting policy compared to other monetary policy settings. Our results show that while IT actually reduced the average inflation rate prior 2008 financial crisis, it has a negative effect on the unemployment rate in the longer term.

Two asymmetries are defined. For the first asymmetric effect, referred to as the IF effect, an inverted L-shaped aggregate supply curve with negative-sloped equilibrium locus is proposed. This AS curve implies that the effect of an easy monetary policy differs in different inflation regimes. The easy monetary policy is expected to base a positive effect, no effect, and a negative effect on output during low, high, and very high inflation regimes, respectively. Our results support this hypothesis. Results regarding the second asymmetric effect, referred to as RE asymmetry, are contradictory. Different classifications of recessions yield contradictory results. By employing official classification. monetary policy shocks support the RE asymmetric hypothesis. The data, however, are not overwhelmingly in favor of the RE asymmetric hypothesis using Markov switching dating. Because the dates of recessions are markedly different for the two classifications, the results demand a more in-depth probe into business cycle dating.",NA,"https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=eoh&AN=0529021&site=ehost-live","Shen_2000_are",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,766

The main results are as follows: (i) the degree of exchange rate pass-through to import prices was quite high in the crisis-hit economies; (ii) the pass-through to Consumer Price Index (CPI) was generally low, with a notable exception of Indonesia; and (iii) in Indonesia, both the impulse response of monetary policy variables to exchange rate shocks and that of CPI to monetary policy shocks were positive, large, and statistically significant. Thus, Indonesia's accommodative monetary policy, coupled with the high degree of CPI responsiveness to exchange rate changes was an important factor in the inflation-depreciation spiral in the wake of the currency crisis.","10.1111/j.1538-4616.2008.00165.x","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1538-4616.2008.00165.x","Ito_2008_exchange",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,790

First, financial risk-return indicators of the banking sector based on a compound option-based structural credit risk model are embedded in a large macro-financial quarterly database covering the period 2008Q4-2019Q4. Second, a SFAVAR identifies and estimates the shocks' responses relating them to the endogenous build-up of banks' vulnerabilities which are consistent with the internally coherent structure of the credit risk model. By introducing structure in the understanding of banks' asset-liability management behavior following monetary policy shocks, the research strategy contributes to disentangling results that are often mixed in the empirical literature. The study finds that unconventional monetary policy, in particular the Asset Purchase Program of the European Central Bank, seems to have been more successful than conventional monetary policy in raising output and inflation. The desired boost to bank lending has been muted and loan cyclicality has varied across countries and loan types. The performance of the banking sector following monetary policy shocks can be characterized by a drop in expected return on equity and assets, a relaxation of lending conditions and increased correlation between banks' assets return and the market return, a mechanism pointing to enhanced risk-taking. While banks' probabilities of default fall following monetary policy shocks, the price of risk increases. Banks' net worth rises via higher market capitalization and implied assets value together with lower volatility, despite often incurring more debt. Risk-taking in the banking sector may pose a risk to financial stability, especially if its effects on banks' vulnerability spread and increase systemic risk.

In late 2000s with the financial crisis, critiques have argued that these economies had fallen into liquidity trap sooner because of the policy mistake of adhering to the 2% inflation target when the policy rate was already too close to zero. As the argument goes, since there was not enough room left to maneuver, central bankers were powerless in their attempt to revive the economy when aggregate demand collapsed. Using SVAR methodology, this paper formally investigates whether unanticipated deviation of OECD short-term rates from the fund rate can indeed explain differential unemployment rate with the US. It also discusses whether low-inflation targeting monetary policy is to be blamed for the financial crisis. The results show that interest rate differential shocks have no effects on unemployment in the very short-run. However, in the long-run, the cost for deviating drastically from US monetary policy is indeed higher and persistent unemployment at home, on average 30, 102, and 186 basis-points after 10, 15, and 20 quarters, respectively for the period 1989q1-2009q4. This cost is on average higher for inflation than non-inflation targeting countries. These findings suggest that the fear of unemployment was partly the reason central bankers kept interest rate low since commodity prices were falling as a result of globalization while the economies were returning to normal partly due to positive supply shocks. Since Canada had its interest rate well aligned with the fund rate prior to the crisis while the inflation target was 2%, but did not suffer as much because sound mortgage rules and financial regulation were in place, the view that higher inflation target might have produced a different outcome does not seem to rest on firm grounds. Therefore, this paper lends support to the view that lax mortgage rules and financial deregulations in the US were the main factors responsible for the crisis.",NA,"https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=eoh&AN=1372826&site=ehost-live","Louis_2013_lowinflationtargeting",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,810

For this purpose, we estimate the basic new Keynesian model by using the Bayesian method for the period of 2000Q1 to 2019Q1. Design/methodology/approach: We use the most recent quarterly dataset of the real gross domestic product index, consumer price index and short term interest rate for Turkey. The prior distribution of structural parameters and shock processes are determined according to the literature. Then, we estimate two different version of the basic new Keynesian model with six distinct chains of Metropolis-Hasting algorithm with each of 100000 draws. Finally, we examine the long term impact of aggressive monetary policy on the effects of structural shocks with the help of the unconditional variance decomposition. Besides, the short term and over time analysis are conducted via the conditional forecast error variance decompositions. Findings: The results of Bayesian impulse responses are consistent with theoretical framework of the new Keynesian synthesis. Besides, the historical shock decompositions of endogenous variables give valuable insight for the last twenty years of Turkish economy. The empirical results show that aggressive monetary policy increases the effects of monetary policy shock on inflation while its impact on output gap and interest rate decreases at every quarter. Moreover, the aggressive monetary policy boosts the effects of supply shock on the variability of output gap over time.",NA,"https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=eoh&AN=1960180&site=ehost-live","Gungor_2019_the",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,815

Impulse responses indicate that house prices rise after an output shock in nine of ten countries. But we also find evidence that real estate prices have a large impact on these key macroeconomic variables. We find out that the house price shock is a germane aggregate demand shock because it raises output and prices and leads to increasing money market rates in all countries. The story behind this finding is that increasing house prices lead to an increase in households' net worth which leads to increasing consumption expentitures and thereby stimulates aggregate demand. This stimulus on aggregate demand leads to increasing output and inflationary pressures on which the central bank reacts by tightening monetary policy. We find out that 12 to 20 percent of output fluctuations and around 10 to 20 percent of price fluctuations can be traced back to the housing demand shock.

We estimate that output growth falls by about one-third of one per cent in both the first and second years after a one percentage point rise in the short-term real interest rate, and by about one-sixth of one per cent in the third year.

As in Bernanke and Boivin, 2001, the model aims at capturing the following facts: monetary authorities use information from a large number of data series to extract a signal on current economic activity, which is typically measured with error. Due to strong collinearity between macroeconomic time series, relevant information is obtained by regressing the observables on few aggregates. Collinearity implies that a large panel of time series, which constitutes the information available to policy makers, can be represented as a dynamic factor model a la Forni and Reichlin, 1998, Stock and Watson, 1999 and Forni et al., 2000. Here we show how, in this framework, shocks can be identified structurally and the parameters of monetary policy rules, conditional on these shocks, can be estimated. Our results for the US economy between 1982 and 2001 show that: (i) Two shocks capture 80% of the variance of key variables such as output and inflation at all horizons; (ii) The monetary shock mainly affects the term structure of interest rates, but has virtually no effect on output and inflation so that monetary policy affects the economy through its systematic behavior rather than by surprising agents; (iii) Since demand and technology have been the main forces for the dynamics of cyclical output and inflation during the Greenspan era, while supply shocks have been negligible, monetary authorities did not face any tradeoff between inflation and output. By stabilizing inflation conditionally on demand shocks, they also achieved output stabilization; (iv) Conditionally on demand, Greenspan followed the Taylor principle while, conditionally on technology, monetary policy did not respond; (v) Systematic monetary policy had a substantial role in output and inflation stabilization.",NA,"https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=eoh&AN=0694815&site=ehost-live","Giannone_2002_tracking",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,826

Most literature on the welfare effects of inflation has largely focused on the aggregate welfare effects of inflation without much assessment about it’s redistributional effects. The first chapter examines, quantitatively, how different income brackets in the U.S. would be impacted in terms of consumption and asset positions if long-run inflation were to rise. The second and third chapters focus on the latter strand of macroeconomics. Recently, central bankers around the world have been debating on what should be the appropriate response of monetary policy to large swings in asset prices. In this spirit, chapter 2 examines what would have happened if the Federal Reserve had reacted to stock price misalignments prior to crashes and major financial crises such as the Great Recession by extending the standard New Keynesian model to include asset prices. First, the proposed model is used to estimate the response of monetary policy to the stock market using Bayesian techniques. We find that the Federal Reserve did not react to U.S. stock market fluctuations during the Great moderation period. We then undertake a counterfactual experiment in which we assume that the Federal Reserve targets stock price misalignments in addition to inflation and output gap. Our policy experiment suggests that had the Federal Reserve raised their policy rate in response to rising stock prices, the boom-bust cycle of stock prices would have been substantially reduced and surprisingly, this would not have been associated with a decrease in average output. For example, the exuberance of the dotcom in the late 1990s and the boom in stock prices associated with the housing market in the mid 2000s would have been milder. Further, the severity of the Great Recession in terms of output loss would have been significantly lower had the policy rate been reactive to rising stock prices prior to the crisis. In the wake of the Great Recession, this chapter contributes to the current debate on whether central banks should target asset price misalignments. The third chapter extends the second chapter to include financial intermediaries to emphasize the role of credit spreads that serve as an important business cycle propagation mechanism. This chapter asks three related questions. First, to what extent has the Federal Reserve adjusted interest rates in response to movements in credit spreads in the past and whether this response has evolved overtime. Second, how does the presence of financial intermediaries that are a source of credit growth, contribute to the fluctuations in the macroeconomy in the face of a monetary policy shock. Third, what effect does a financial shock that tends to increase credit spreads have on macro variables in the economy?",NA,"https://www.proquest.com/openview/fc8e06cf4bbe3558f6ea63fec9037238/1?pq-origsite=gscholar&cbl=18750","NA_NA_essays",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,838

Higher unemployment and tighter borrowing conditions make the richer (i.e., employed) comparably worse off. The result reverses, if we focus on the subsample of households whose head is employed.

This paper therefore estimates a medium scale New Keynesian model (with earnings and assets based collateral constraint) to explore the impact of such policy errors on Indian business cycles, capturing the prevailing narrative on both monetary and fiscal policies along with the actual inflation scenario. Our smoothed estimates of mark-up, productivity, interest rate and government expenditure shocks mimic the actual transition of the economy, with both policy shocks moving together in a similar pattern in the post crisis period. We find that the interest rate policy was highly contractionary during 2013-2016 which led to significantly lower output. We rationalize that if supply side shocks (adverse productivity or mark-up) dominate, such policy errors tend to occur, suggesting that policy makers need to pay attention to the sources of inflation in a developing economy while setting demand-management policies.

According to the dilemma hypothesis, global financial cycles determine domestic financial conditions regardless of an economy's exchange rate regime and monetary policy autonomy is possible only if capital mobility is restricted. We find that global financial cycles indeed reduce domestic monetary policy effectiveness in more financially integrated economies. However, we also find that another salient feature of financial globalisation has the opposite effect and amplifies monetary policy effectiveness. Economies increasingly net long in foreign currency experience larger valuation effects on their external balance sheets in response to exchange rate movements triggered by monetary policy impluses. Overall, we find that the net effect of financial globalisation since the 1990s has been to amplify monetary policy effectiveness in the typical advanced and emerging market economy. Specifically, our results suggest that the output effect of a tightening in monetary policy has been stronger by 40% due to financial globalisation. Insofar as valuation effects can only play out if an economy's exchange rate is flexible, the choice of the exchange rate regime remains critical for monetary policy autonomy under capital mobility and in the presence of global financial cycles. Thus, our results suggest that the classic trilemma remains valid.","10.24149/gwp222","https://papers.ssrn.com/abstract=2643948","Georgiadis_2015_trilemma",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,848

Following reasons could be attributed to this. First, the Central Bank strictly controls the volume as well as the rates on credit and deposits. Second, commercial banks mainly rely on long term deposits and interbank borrowing to finance credit, and not the Central Bank's discount window. Third, the security market is not well developed, and firms heavily depend on credit from banks to fund their projects. Fourth, the fixed interest rate does not cause problems, for firms while the Central Bank's quantitative restrictions in the credit might have effects on borrowings.

First, I study the perspective of equity investors and their reaction to the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) announcements, when they disagree on Nominal Interest Rate level decisions. My evidence shows that investor expectations formulated prior to FOMC announcements have a significant impact on equity prices, particularly when these expectations are not aligned with the FOMC committee decisions. My results reconcile past findings on the monetary policy surprise literature and more recent empirical findings on the effect of FOMC announcements on equity markets. Moreover, as I find no effect on equity returns when the FOMC committee decision is anticipated by the market, a practical implication of my study is that monetary policy authorities should take into account market expectations when formulating disclosure policy in order to improve alignment with financial market expectations and smooth out their economic consequences. Second, I provide evidence of the effects of the European Central Bank (ECB) monetary policy shocks on the real economy, specifically on industrial production and inflation. This analysis investigates how the ECB monetary policy shocks impact industrial production (output) and inflation (prices) following the established narrative methodology of Romer & Romer (2004). Past standard statistical approaches have yielded very limited results in terms of magnitude. The narrative methodology, conversely, has yielded significant effects of monetary shocks on prices and output. Most of these studies analysed the effect of monetary policy in the United States and only a recent portion of the literature has extended the analysis to other countries (United Kingdom and Canada). This chapter contributes to the extant literature in extending the narrative methodology to the Eurozone and adapting it to include the unconventional monetary policies put in place by the Governing Council of the ECB in the past decade. To do so, I gather a novel dataset of macroeconomic forecasts and construct a new measure of monetary policy shocks. Industrial production responds to unpredictable monetary policy shocks with a decline of over 0.5%. On the contrary, inflation responds weakly to monetary shocks, with a very modest and unstable decrease of 0.05%. Furthermore, I provide empirical evidence of the heterogeneous responses of inflation and output among Eurozone countries. These last results are particularly relevant to policy makers of the ECB Governing Council, given that their policy decisions should have a homogenous effect on the Eurozone economy. Third, I investigate whether financial market stability is a concern for monetary policy makers in the case of the European Central Bank (ECB) and Bank of England (BOE). Whether financial market stability should be a concern of monetary policy makers is an unresolved and long debated question, which has resurfaced after the 2008 financial crisis. In this chapter, I propose a forward-looking Augmented Taylor (1993) Rule to investigate the conduct of monetary policy and apply this idea to the 2003–2018 time period for both the ECB and the BOE. I show that a forward-looking Augmented Taylor Rule explains the deviation of observed rates consistent with its implied rates. By including a measure of Financial Market Stability Slack, I also show that the evolving preferences of monetary policy makers have taken into account the financial markets turmoil, particularly in the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis.",NA,"https://ueaeprints.uea.ac.uk/id/eprint/79751/","Murgia_2020_the",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,851

A key issue concerns the relationship between regional economic cyclicity and monetary union: in the absence of a common automatic fiscal stabilization mechanism and with limited geographical mobility of factors, the greater the asymmetry of shocks across the regions making up a currency area, the more that area departs from an optimal single currency space as far as monetary policy is concerned. Our aim in this article is to investigate whether the regions in the Eurozone have become more or less similar in their vulnerability and resilience to economic shocks since the monetary union. Using predictions based on a spatial panel model with random effects, an endogenous spatial lag and spatially autoregressive errors, we find that a common contractionary shock across the Eurozone has its biggest impact on the most geographically isolated regions, which are precisely those peripheral regions in Euroland that are suffering the most acute sovereign debt crisis, and which are among the lowest productivity regions of the European Union.

Inflation volatility is measured by conditional variance generated by fitting an empirical Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Hetroskedasticity (GARCH) model to a seasonally adjusted annualized quarterly consumer price inflation for the period 1960Q1-2013Q3. The volatility measure, together with macroeconomic control variables, was used to estimate economic growth models for two periods corresponding to two monetary policy regimes and a third period covering the full sample. The first period corresponds to the pre-inflation targeting regime covering 1960Q1-1998Q4. During this period, the country had adopted various monetary policy frameworks including exchange-rate targeting, discretionary monetary policy, monetary-aggregate targeting and an eclectic approach. This period was largely characterized by high and more volatile inflation. The inflation volatility in turn had statistically significant negative impact on economic growth during this period. Nonetheless, inflation volatility did not have statistically significant impact on real economic growth during the inflation targeting monetary policy period, i.e. 2000Q1-2013Q3. The empirical results for the combined growth model are consistent with the findings for the two periods. The implication of this is that by adopting the inflation targeting monetary policy framework since 2000, South Africa has succeeded in achieving low and stable general price level thereby creating a conducive environment for economic growth. The higher growth period of the mid 2000s followed the introduction of inflation targeting monetary policy regime. Nevertheless, higher Sacrifice Ratio of disinflation and entrenched structural bottlenecks continue to undermine growth and stifle the spillover effects from low and stable inflation to real economic activities.

In the first chapter, I introduce an OTC credit default swap (CDS) market into a search model of credit and unsecured debt. The model is developed to study the effects of CDS trading on liquidity, risk sharing, and corporate borrowing costs in an economy where agents are matched trilaterally to trade capital and issue debt. With firms subject to an exogenous default risk, risk averse lenders have the opportunity to purchase a CDS from insurers as protection against their underlying bonds. The model raises implications for corporate credit and investment demand; borrowing costs that vary with the degree of default risk; and potential issues pertaining to moral hazard, empty creditors, and financial sector stability. In addition, its theory corroborates empirical evidence regarding the relationship between corporate debt markets and derivatives trading. The second chapter investigates the implications of sector-specific credit supply shocks on real economic activity in the United States from 1952 to 2018. These sectors include private households, non-financial corporations, and banks. Within a structural vector autoregression (VAR) framework, I employ a novel sign-restriction strategy to identify one monetary policy shock, two aggregate macroeconomic shocks, and three sector-specific credit supply shocks. I find evidence that credit supply shocks not only vary by the sectors in which they arise, but also by their consequences for business cycle dynamics. Credit shocks originating in the banking sector can explain up to 25% of output fluctuations while those arising in the household and corporate sectors can each explain up to 15%. In addition, household and bank credit shocks may hold long-run consequences for inflation explaining up to 15% of its fluctuations. Within a historical context, the model identifies several periods when credit supply has been a significant driver of GDP. With respect to the 2008 financial crisis, I find a smaller role for credit shocks relative to aggregate supply shocks than is typically found in the literature. This supports recent empirical evidence suggesting that the early stages of the crisis were more reminiscent of an oil price shock recession. The third chapter analyzes the lending channel of monetary policy exclusively through credit card and small business bank loans. A time-varying parameter VAR is estimated providing evidence that the direction and strength in which credit card and small business loans respond to monetary policy are time-dependent. To investigate these findings analytically, I develop a general equilibrium model of consumer credit card and small business lending. Households and firms use a combination of monetary assets and bank loans to finance random consumption and investment opportunities. In accordance with conventional theory, when borrowers are sufficiently constrained, a monetary tightening reduces lending through the balance sheet subchannel of monetary policy. However, when borrowers are less constrained, a monetary tightening raises unsecured debt limits through a second subchannel and lending expands. This second subchannel, operating solely through unsecured credit, offers a new theory to justify an expansionary loan response to tightened monetary policy that the traditional lending channel literature has yet to address.",NA,"https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=eoh&AN=1936189&site=ehost-live","Littlejohn_2021_essays",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,870

In doing so, I draw on frontier methods in quasi-experimental design paired with rich micro-level datasets that allow me to study the effectiveness of aggregate policy measures. I also complement my empirical tools with theoretical models to pin down transmission mechanisms. The first chapter examines the impact of corporate tax policy in altering the efficacy of monetary policy. In recent decades there has been much focus in the macroeconomics literature on under-standing heterogeneous effects of monetary and fiscal policy. Although numerous empirical studies have explored monetary policy transmission via various financial and non-financial factors, the theoretical frontier has continuously highlighted that separate analysis of monetary and fiscal policy may overlook important policy interactions. In this chapter, I use narratively-identified variation in marginal tax reforms in the US and show that the average impact of monetary policy depends on preceding corporate tax changes. Specifically, I find that monetary policy is more effective on employment, sales and investment for firms facing an increase in the statutory rate relative to those with stable statutory tax rates. Moreover, I document that monetary policy is least effective on firms that received marginal tax cuts. The empirical findings are rationalized using a New Keynesian model featuring capital and corporate taxes. The theoretical model and empirical results demonstrate that tax shifts may significantly amplify or dampen the effectiveness of monetary policy. The second chapter of my dissertation analyzes post-WWII US corporate tax policy changes. This is part of joint work with James Cloyne and Paolo Surico, where we build two new proxies on marginal tax rate and investment tax credits and investigate the causal effects of corporate tax changes on business investment dynamics. We find that both marginal tax rates and investment tax credits are tools genuinely effective across the firm distribution, yet on average marginal tax rate changes are more effective at raising firms' investment rates than investment tax credits. Exploiting micro-level heterogeneity, we also show that small, low-leverage, and high-growth firms are more sensitive to corporate tax policy changes, which suggests that firm characteristics may have a role in propagating the effectiveness of these tax tools. Overall, our findings provide a comparison of the two most common tools used in corporate tax policy and highlight the role of firm characteristics in studying US corporate tax policy. Lastly, Chapter 3 documents the first micro-level evidence on the asymmetric effects of monetary policy in the US. Various studies on monetary transmission literature have documented non-linear effects of monetary policy at the aggregate level. However, there are few studies that use micro-data to explore sign-dependent monetary effectiveness at the disaggregate level. Focusing on firm-level data from 1980q3 to 2016q3, I find that monetary contractions have larger effects on firm-level employment, investment and sales than monetary expansions. These results are consistent with the aggregate findings in the literature and are robust to sample selection, sector-level analysis and alternative monetary policy shocks. Furthermore, I examine the role of financial characteristics in propagating the asymmetric effects of monetary policy. My findings show a larger employment and investment response to a monetary tightening for firms with small size, low leverage, high liquidity or no-dividend paying status. For the employment results, I also find firms with low leverage or high liquidity to respond more to monetary expansions; however, this effect is much weaker as compared to monetary contractions. These results provide evidence that financial characteristics have a role in propagating the asymmetric effects of monetary policy.",NA,"https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=eoh&AN=1936174&site=ehost-live","Kurt_2021_essays",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,871

The higher the LTV ratio, the higher are the effects of the government's housing policy instrument for stabilising the housing market on real macroeconomic variables such as consumption and output in Turkey.

Design/methodology/approach – The authors develop a small model that facilitates OLS and VAR estimates of the critical period. Findings – The empirical results support the claim of John B. Taylor and others who held that monetary policy was excessively stimulative in terms of the low fed funds rate 2002‐2005, but also support the view of Alan Greenspan and others that the linkages between short‐term rates, long‐term rates, and the housing market deteriorated during that decade. Originality/value – The model includes the Taylor Rule, a housing equation, and a mechanism linking the two relationships. The empirical results support elements of the camp that blames monetary policy for the recent housing crisis, and elements of the opposing camp which limits policy culpability. Specifically, it suggests excessive monetary ease and a structural change (for which the Fed cannot be blamed) in the monetary policy‐housing market linkage that occurred prior to the crisis. The results also support long‐term, prior crisis, channels of influence that run from the state of the economy to fed funds rates to mortgage interest rates to housing prices. A return to normalcy in the housing market should be accompanied by the re‐establishment of these channels.","10.1108/SEF-Feb-2012-0027","https://doi.org/10.1108/SEF-Feb-2012-0027","Spencer_2013_monetary",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,880

Such analyses typically require strong assumptions. Moreover, specific changes could have off-setting effects regarding the overall effectiveness of monetary policy. In order to shed light on this issue, we investigate whether there has been a significant change in the overall transmission of monetary policy to inflation and output by estimating a standard Vector Autoregression (VAR) for the euro area and by endogenously searching for possible break dates. We find a significant break point around 1996 and some evidence for a second one around 1999. We compare the effects of monetary policy shocks for these episodes and find that the well-known 'stylized facts' of monetary policy transmission remain valid.

Chapter 2 analyzes an important step in the transmission of monetary policy--the interest rate pass-through from money market rates to consumer retail loan and deposit rates--in Canada from 1983 to 2015 using a nonlinear vector error-correction model. I find that pass-through was complete for all rates before the financial crisis but since the end of the 2008-09 recession, it has signicantly declined for deposit rates.

We use recently proposed methods to construct a shadow interest rate that captures monetary policy at the zero lower bound and estimate a small open economy Bayesian structural vector autoregressive model. Controlling for the US macroeconomic and monetary policy variables, we find that Canadian unconventional monetary policy had expansionary effects on the Canadian economy. Chapter 4 shifts focus to fiscal policy. The rise in US partisan conflict following the Great Recession led to a popular belief that uncertainty about fiscal policy was impeding output growth. I explore this hypothesis by nesting it in a standard structural vector autoregression model traditionally used for estimating fiscal multipliers. I augment the model with stochastic volatility (a measure of uncertainty) and allow that to interact with the endogenous variables. I consider various trend assumptions, subsamples, information sets and estimation methods and find that the evidence does not support i this hypothesis. The results reveal that there is no systematic relationship between fiscal policy uncertainty and output. Moreover, a time-varying parameter version of the model shows that the lack of consistency across specifications is not driven by changes in the transmission of uncertainty shocks over time.",NA,"https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=eoh&AN=1677813&site=ehost-live","Popiel_2017_an",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,891

Although sales occur very frequently, macroeconomists often filter them out because sales are not responsive to economic shocks. Using micro data underlying CPI, I demonstrate that after sales, the price index of durables goes down gradually, and that the aggregation of sales of durable goods have a significant impact on the aggregate inflation. However, sales of nondurables--the focus of previous studies--do not show these results. To study the impact of sales, I then propose a two-sector menu-cost model with the feature of sales. The model is able to match the pattern of sales and moments in the micro data. By contrast, failing to account for temporary sales in a menu-cost model would increase the output effect by 73%, and the Calvo model calibrated to the frequency of regular price changes triples the output effect. Chapter 2 examines the impact of unconventional monetary policies on the stock market when the short-term nominal interest rate is stuck at the zero lower bound. Unconventional monetary policies appear to have significant effects on stock prices and the effects differ across stocks. In agreement with existing credit channel theories, I find that firms subject to financial constraints react more strongly to unconventional monetary policy shocks (especially large-scale asset purchases) than do less constrained firms. My results imply that the credit channel is as important as the interest rate channel in the transmission of unconventional monetary policies at the zero lower bound. Chapter 3 investigates the time-varying effects of monetary policy shocks on financial markets. I show that the corporate bond market is highly responsive to monetary policy shocks throughout 2000-2012, implying a high pass-through of policy-induced movements in Treasury yields to private yields even during the zero lower bound period.

The alternative approach incorporates available measures of market participants' expectations of economic variables in order to calculate economic innovations to those variables. In general, expectations measures should provide important additional information relative to a standard VAR analysis, since market participants presumably use a much richer information set than that assumed in a typical VAR model. The resulting innovations are easily incorporated in a VAR-like framework. ; The empirical results are quite surprising. First, when expectations are incorporated, the variance of all innovations is reduced substantially. Second, innovations to the federal funds rate derived using the alternative approach are only somewhat correlated with their VAR counterparts, while innovations to other economic variables are essentially uncorrelated. Still, monetary policy shocks derived using both approaches are still somewhat correlated, however, since innovations to prices and economic activity explain only a small fraction of innovations to the federal funds rate.

I address this question through the lens of a classic episode: the currency devaluations of the 1930s. From 1931 to 1936, many of the biggest economies in the world successively left the gold standard or devalued, leading to a depreciation of their currency by more than 30% against gold. In theory, the effect is ambiguous for countries that did not devalue: expenditure switching can lower their output, but the monetary stimulus to demand might raise it. I use cross-sectional evidence to discipline the strength of these two mechanisms in a multi-country model. This evidence comes in two forms: (i) causal inference of the effect of devaluation on country-level variables, (ii) new product-level data to estimate parameters that are essential to discipline the response of trade--the international elasticity of substitution among foreign varieties, and the pass-through of the exchange rate to international prices. Contrary to the popular narrative in modern policy debates, devaluation did not dramatically lower the output of trading partners in this context. The expenditure switching effect was mostly offset by the monetary stimulus to foreign demand. In chapter 2, Emi Nakamura, Jon Steinsson, and I provide new estimates of the evolution of productivity in England from 1250 to 1870. Real wages over this period were heavily influenced by plague-induced swings in the population. We develop and implement a new methodology for estimating productivity that accounts for these Malthusian dynamics. In the early part of our sample, we find that productivity growth was zero. Productivity growth began in 1600--almost a century before the Glorious Revolution. Post-1600 productivity growth had two phases: an initial phase of modest growth of 4% per decade between 1600 and 1810, followed by a rapid acceleration at the time of the Industrial Revolution to 18% per decade. Our evidence helps distinguish between theories of why growth began. In particular, our findings support the idea that broad-based economic change preceded the bourgeois institutional reforms of 17th century England and may have contributed to causing them. We also estimate the strength of Malthusian population forces on real wages. We find that these forces were sufficiently weak to be easily overwhelmed by post-1800 productivity growth. In chapter 3, Carlo Altavilla, Miguel Boucinha, and I propose a new methodology to identify aggregate demand and supply shocks in the bank loan market. We present a model of sticky bank-firm relationships, estimate its structural parameters in euro area credit register data, and infer aggregate shocks based on those estimates. To achieve credible identification, we leverage banks' exposure to various sectors' heterogeneous liquidity needs during the COVID-19 Pandemic. We find that developments in lending volumes following the pandemic were largely explained by demand shocks. Fluctuations in lending rates were instead mostly determined by bank-driven supply shocks and borrower risk. A by-product of our analysis is a structural interpretation of two-way fixed effects regressions in loan-level data: according to our framework, firm- and bank-time fixed effects only separate demand from supply under certain parametric assumptions. In the data, the conditions are satisfied for supply but not for demand: bank-time fixed effects identify true supply shocks up to a time constant, while firm-time fixed effects are contaminated by supply forces. Our methodology overcomes this limitation: we identify supply and demand shocks at the aggregate and individual levels. In chapter 4, I study how the fiscal side of the US government reacts to monetary policy. I estimate the response of several fiscal variables to monetary shocks. Following an interest rate hike, tax receipts fall, outlays excluding interest payments are constant, and interest payments and debt increase. The fall in output that follows a monetary tightening--not legislated changes in marginal tax rates--drives the response of receipts. The fiscal authority therefore responds passively to monetary shocks, keeping expenditures constant and letting debt adjust to satisfy its budget constraint. In heterogeneous agent models, this scenario dampens output's response to monetary policy.",NA,"https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=eoh&AN=2009326&site=ehost-live","Bouscasse_2022_essays",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,907

This thesis examines its effects on the transmission of monetary policy through the bank lending channel, and its effects on output in the host countries. The first essay develops a general equilibrium model to address the questions: 1) does the economy with a higher foreign bank penetration respond in the same way to external and internal shocks as one with a lower penetration; and 2) can domestic monetary policy still be used effectively to stabilize the foreign bank-dominant economy. We examine the propagation of external and internal shocks and the effectiveness of monetary policy in two alternative scenarios: an economy dominated by domestic banks and an economy dominated by foreign banks. By applying numerical simulation methods, we find that an economy with the foreign bank-dominant banking sector is associated with lower loan interest rates, more credit, and higher output, wage and employment, compared to a domestic bank-dominant economy. Moreover, the foreign bank-dominant economy is shown to be less responsive to changes in domestic monetary policy. This suggests that, in order to isolate the domestic output from the effect of external shocks, central banks in the foreign bank-dominant economies need to conduct the monetary policy more cautiously, taking into account a buffer effect from the presence of foreign banks. Overall we conclude that foreign banks play the role of a stabilizing force in the host economies, but the effectiveness of monetary policy is reduced due to the presence of foreign banks in these foreign bank-dominant economies. The second essay examines empirical evidence of the bank lending channel of the monetary policy by comparing the responses of domestic and foreign banks to domestic monetary policy shocks at the individual bank level. We investigate the effects of domestic and foreign ownership on the loan lending and deposit taking behavior of more than 1200 banks in the emerging economies in Eastern & Central Europe, Latin America and Asia over the period from 1996 to 2003. We employ pooled OLS and panel VAR methods, and find evidence for the existence of the varying degree of a bank lending channel across banks with different international ownership. Foreign banks are shown to be less responsive to domestic monetary policy shocks, that is, they adjust their loan and deposit growth rates less than domestic private banks. This lower sensitivity to domestic monetary policy by foreign banks can be explained by foreign banks' access to the internal capital market of their parent banks. The evidence from aggregated data also shows that the effects of monetary policy on total bank loans tend to be lower in economies with higher foreign bank penetration level. The third essay examines the implications of foreign bank penetration on resource allocation in host countries. It finds some evidence that foreign banks tend to have labor better allocated to more productive sectors. The effect of output reduction on unemployment rate is buffered in economies with higher foreign bank penetration level. This evidence is interpreted as consistent with a better labor allocation associated with foreign bank participation. This effect is still significant after controlling for the degree of competitiveness in banking sector, which could be interpreted as consistent with the hypothetical ""direct effect"" of foreign bank penetration on economic growth. However, the effect of capital on economic growth is not found significantly different with different level of foreign bank penetration. Overall, these findings suggest that the effects of foreign bank penetration on economic growth are modest and should not be overstated.",NA,"https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=eoh&AN=1002820&site=ehost-live","Wu_2008_essays",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,910

GDP no doubt is affected by the Monetary Policy of the state. Among the monetary policies that the CBK adopts in intervening the Kenyan economy, Open Market Operation is the one which is most frequently used due to its easily observable effect and relatively low cost during operation. Via buying and selling treasuries the C.B.K adjusts the money supply in the market and manipulates the economy. In recent years, a modern practice of this policy is used by the CBK which targets the money market funds rate to control the money supply. The research papers of various authors have been studied in this regard to prove the Hypothesis and after in depth analysis by applying Regression Analysis technique it has been observed that the relationship between the two exists. The data of past 10 years of Kenya has been used for driving the conclusion. The study proved that the Growth in Money Supply greatly affects the GDP of an economy, obviously various unknown factors also affects the GDP. This research shows that Monetary Policy has a Positive relationship with GDP although the relationship is not that significant. This positive relationship can be explained by the fact that the level of Money Supply in the economy influences the purchasing power of firms, Individuals and also the Expenditure of the Government. The research further shows that the Rate of Growth of Labour, EXPO, Government Expenditure and Aggregate Investment also do not have a significant determinant on the rate of growth of GDP. In addition, Money Supply the variable of interest was found not to be a significant determinant of GDP in Kenya this is because there are structural weaknesses in the financial sector such as weak legal framework, poor governance, and insufficient infrastructure, which have contributed to high interest rate spreads, inadequate financial intermediation and heightened risks and therefore hamper the transmission mechanism of monetary policy.

This study presents a small semi-structural dynamic general equilibrium (DGE) New Keynesian model for Bangladesh to explore the dynamic interrelationships among major macroeconomic variables related to the transmission mechanism of monetary policy. Our DGE model comprises of four key behavioral equations--the aggregate demand (output), aggregate supply (inflation), interest rate and, the exchange rate. Using quarterly data over the sample period from 2006:Q3 to 2016:Q2, we have used Generalized Method of Moments estimation technique, which is useful for estimating forward-looking reaction functions on the basis of expected values for macroeconomic variables. The findings demonstrate that the model is inclusive enough to capture how the selected variables are interrelated. In most of the cases, the study finds significant and similar nature of interrelationships among the major macroeconomic variables as found by previous studies on Canada, Thailand, and South Africa. The model is also flexible enough in understanding shock propagation and conducting policy analyses. For Bangladesh, the policy transmission mechanism is found less efficient to control the monetary system (over 10 years to revert to steady state after the occurrence of shocks), while Canada, South Africa, and Thailand need 5 years, 10 years, and 10 years, respectively. This happens mainly due to the weak monetary policy which has two consequences. First, a small reaction parameter in the interest rate equation which means that the interest rate is only marginally adjusted to high inflation. Second, a small effect of monetary policy on the economy through the output and exchange rate equations. Most notably, in the exchange rate equation, the uncovered interest parity indicates a low coefficient. This might happen due to the absence of inflation targeting monetary policy in Bangladesh. A strong and quick policy response is required which could be achieved by implementing two major policy tasks: adoption of an inflation-targeting monetary policy, and full autonomy of Bangladesh Bank in both administrative and functional areas.",NA,"https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=eoh&AN=1907726&site=ehost-live","Khan_2019_a",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,917

The first chapter investigates the relation between interest rate policy and nominal exchange rate volatility. Using data of countries in currency crisis, I employ a time-varying-transition-probability (TVTP) Markov-switching model to study the interest rate- exchange rate nexus. The second chapter studies the impact of macroeconomic policy by introducing different policy shocks into an equilibrium business cycle model. In particular, monetary policy is modelled as an interest rate rule (Taylor Rule) to investigate liquidity effects and persistence in output and inflation. The third chapter (with Charles M. Engel) revisits the role of heterogeneity and aggregation bias in explaining the purchasing power parity (PPP) puzzle. In Chapter 1 the interest rate-exchange rate nexus and the effectiveness of an interest rate defense are investigated theoretically and empirically. I construct a simple theoretical model by incorporating an interest rate rule in the model proposed by Jeanne and Rose (2002). The model has multiple equilibria, and under plausible conditions, higher exchange rate volatility is associated with higher interest rates. The theoretical model motivates me to adopt a Markov-switching specification of the nominal exchange rate with time-varying transition probabilities. The data of Indonesia, South Korea, the Philippines, Thailand, Mexico, and Turkey indicate that raising nominal interest rates leads to a higher probability of switching to a crisis regime. Thus, the empirical results presented here support the view that a high interest rate policy is unable to defend the exchange rate. Unlike other studies which consider linear models only, our findings are robust and consistent over different countries and crisis episodes (Asian 1997 crises, Mexico 1994 crisis, and Turkey 1994, 2001 crises). Chapter 2 examines the impact of macroeconomic policy shocks in a flexible-price general equilibrium business cycle model with money. In addition to technology shocks, I include government consumption, government investment, the tax rate and monetary policy as sources of random disturbances. The results show that this extended model does a good job of mimicking the characteristics of post-war business cycles, which may imply that monetary and fiscal shocks play an important role in the explanation of post-war business cycles. In particular, rather than adopting a money supply rule, monetary policy is modelled as the central bank using a simple interest rate rule (Taylor rule). Without assuming price stickiness or frictions in financial markets, the model can account for liquidity effects, generate high persistence in output and inflation, and capture positive cross-correlations between inflation and output. In Chapter 3, we show that recent studies which emphasize the importance of heterogeneity and aggregation bias may underestimate the half-lives of PPP deviations because of failure to account for small sample bias. Such bias plays a predominant role in good-specific persistence. Imbs et al.(2002) claim that there is no PPP puzzle when cross-sectional heterogeneity of goods is allowed for.

In order to do that, I estimate three different models that incorporate novel features that allow me to isolate those effects. The models are estimated using recently developed Bayesian techniques (Hamiltonian Monte Carlo) that allow me to consider non linearities and interesting economic features that could not have been considered in the past. In the first essay, I estimate the evolution of fiscal multipliers in the postwar era, using a time varying parameter vector autorregressive model that includes stochastic volatility. First, I find that there is significant evidence that the multiplier has changed over time, once we control for changes in volatility, but that there is no empirical support to claim that the fiscal multiplier is bigger during a recession even if we consider different components of government spending, as some recent literature has suggested. Second, I show that not accounting for stochastic volatility in the model can seriously affect both the size and the uncertainty around the fiscal multiplier. Finally, I show that government spending was extremely ineffective during the Great Recession of 2008, but taxes and transfer payments played an important role to stabilize the economy. In the second essay, I consider the contribution of changes in the conduct of Monetary Policy to the so-called ""Great Moderation"" (that is, the reduction of the volatility of several macroeconomic variables after 1985). I argue that a better monetary policy conduct can be responsible for the Great Moderation and the stabilization of the economy after the high inflation episodes of the 1970s, contrary to the findings of other authors. The estimation is based on a model that incorporates time varying responses of monetary policy to changes in inflation and output, and that, as a novelty, estimates the relationship between those responses and the volatility of those variables. There are two main findings. First, I show that there is evidence of a change in the conduct of monetary policy during the sample period. Second, using counterfactual exercises, I find that after Paul Volcker is appointed as Chairman of the Federal Reserve, the economy would have been more volatile if the conduct of monetary policy would not have changed. Moreover, the economy would have exhibit less uncertainty in the Pre-Volcker period if the policy conducted afterwards would have been in place. In the last essay, I propose a framework and a model-consistent estimation approach for the analysis of the dynamic consequences of changes in volatility. The proposed model is a Vector Autoregression in which time-varying volatility has a first-order impact on the observable variables. The volatility process is estimated within the model, and therefore, the proposed estimation approach does not rely on proxy measures of aggregate uncertainty as it has been generally done in the literature extant. Estimates of the proposed model using data from the United States show important quantitative and qualitative departures from estimates incorporating non-model-consistent measures of volatility. In particular, an increase in overall volatility similar to the one experienced during the Great Recession is predicted to have a strong negative and persistent impact on key macroeconomic indicators, including output, investment and the unemployment rate, and to worsen financial conditions. Moreover, a decomposition of the estimated volatility time series shows that fiscal volatility shocks are associated with important deflationary pressures, have a strong crowding out effect on investment and increase the cost of borrowing. Finally, the estimated model predicts that volatility has an asymmetric effect on the economy so that only rare shocks matter.",NA,"https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=eoh&AN=1537370&site=ehost-live","Montes-Galdon_2015_essays",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,923

We address the simultaneity problem of identifying monetary policy and leverage shocks by using a combination of short-run and long-run restrictions. We also use the sign restriction approach to the identification of shocks to distinguish between leverage supply and leverage demand shocks, as one would expect the macroeconomic effects of these two types of leverage shocks to be quite different.

Although standard methods such as GARCH are used to test volatility, the uniqueness of this study is that it tests the volatility of monetary policy using ordinary least squares (OLS), autoregressive distributed lag (ARDL) and IRF methods. We find that the standard deviation of the broad money supply and the real interest rate business cycle tends to have a negative impact on real growth in the short and long run, supporting the proposition that a high interest rate negatively affects real growth. We also document that the standard deviation of the real exchange rate business cycle has a positive (negative) effect on real growth in the short and long run and is not statistically significant. This suggests that the volatility of the real exchange rate does not affect real growth. Moreover, the magnitude of the volatility of the coefficients is lower in the long run than in the short run. To achieve sustainable economic growth, policy makers need to plan how to manage the volatility of the money supply and the interest rate in the short run and develop long-run strategies to manage volatility in the long run.

Romer and Romer (1989), Ramsey (1993), Oliner and Rudebusch (1995), and Morris and Sellon (1995) raised some doubts about the existence and effectiveness of the credit channel. Alternatively, several other studies have found support for the credit/bank lending channel (see for instance, Bernanke and Blinder (1988), Bernanke and Blinder (1992), Gertler and Gilchrist (1994), Bernanke and Gertler (1995), Peek and Rosengren (1995), Kashyap, Stein and Wilcox (1993), Kashyap and Stein (1995, 2000), and Suzuki (2004). Therefore, the validity of bank lending/credit channels remains largely inconclusive and an empirical issue. Although the transmission mechanism of monetary policy in Nigeria has been examined in numerous studies, there is no consensus on the most effective channel; and there is scant evidence of the role of credit channel in the transmission of monetary policy. In this paper, we examine the validity and efficacy of the credit channel in the monetary policy transmission in Nigeria, using a vector autoregressive model to analyse monthly data spanning ten years (2008-2018). The empirical analysis relies on Uslu (2016) modified slightly to substitute Bank total asset and Bank deposits to represent the asset side and liability side of the bank's balance sheet, respectively. Purchasing Managers Index (PMI), consumer price index (CPI) and the real effective exchange rate (REER) are used as proxy for development in macroeconomic activity; while all share index (ASI) and market capitalization (MK) denote substitutable assets in the balance sheet of the banks. All series except the money market rates were transformed into natural logarithms. In addition, nominal series were transformed to real variables by normalization using the consumer price index. We find that a positive shock to monetary policy rate has no effect on bank lending to private sector. This could be due to a few factors. Primarily, the Nigerian financial industry is plagued by a low ratio of lending to private sector. Nigerian banks show a preference for government bonds and other securities, which stifles lending to the presumably risky private sector. It is also possible that monetary policy rates are already so high, driven by Nigeria's growing debt needs and exchange rate crises; that the lending to private sector has declined to such a level that it no longer responds to positive credit shocks.",NA,"https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=eoh&AN=1910130&site=ehost-live","Udoh_2021_monetary",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,938

Researchers frequently find evidence of a 'price puzzle': increases in the policy rate are followed by higher rather than lower inflation. This can be explained by the forward-looking behaviour of the central bank. Inflation does not rise in response to an increase in the policy rate but, instead, the central bank raises its policy rate when it expects inflation to increase in the future. To identify the true causal effects of monetary policy on inflation, it is hence necessary to control for this systematic policy response to expected inflation. For Australia, however, the price puzzle has been found even when controlling for the cash rate's systematic response to the Reserve Bank's own inflation forecasts. I argue that this is due to an additional but omitted systematic response of the cash rate to credit market shocks. Easier credit market conditions lead to an economic expansion and higher inflation. Therefore, the Bank raises the cash rate--its policy rate--when credit spreads decline. However, the Bank's inflation forecasts do not fully capture the inflationary effect of easier credit conditions. As a result, cash rate changes are positively correlated with future inflation even when purging them of the cash rate's response to the Bank's inflation forecasts. Accordingly, I show that accounting for the cash rate's additional response to credit market conditions resolves the price puzzle. As expected, a higher cash rate reduces inflation and output growth, and raises the unemployment rate.",NA,"https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=eoh&AN=1826271&site=ehost-live","Beckers_2020_credit",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,961

Journal of Monetary Economics 34, 75–88] adopted a narrative approach to address the identification problems in time series models of monetary policy. Based on Federal Reserve documents, the Romers created a dummy variable equal to one in periods when the Federal Reserve contracted in response to perceived inflationary pressures. This paper shows: (1) the dummy variable is predictable from past macroeconomic variables, reflecting the endogenous response of policy to the economy; (2) unpredictable changes in the dummy do not generate dynamic responses that look like the effects of monetary policy. The identification problems that plague time series models also afflict the narrative approach.","10.1016/S0304-3932(97)00051-2","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304393297000512","Leeper_1997_narrative",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,964

There is, however, considerable cross‐industry heterogeneity in both the overall policy effects and the degree of asymmetry across the two business cycle phases. We then explore which industry characteristics can account for this cross‐industry heterogeneity. Differences in the overall policy effects can mainly be explained by the durability of the goods produced in the sector. This can be regarded as evidence for the conventional interest rate/cost‐of‐capital channel. In contrast, differences in the degree of asymmetry of policy effects are related to differences in financial structure, in particular the maturity structure of debt, the coverage ratio, financial leverage and firm size.

It plays a crucial, perhaps even central, role in the study of monetary economics. However, few studies have focussed on developing small, open economies, and even fewer have covered characteristics such as the aggregate demand components, the low independence of monetary policy, the weak developing financial markets and structural changes in the economy. Few quantitative empirical studies have been conducted on the monetary transmission mechanism in Vietnam, and they do not include a non-recursive structural vector autoregression model with structural breaks, and characteristics of a small, open economy. This study attempts to fill such research gaps. The aim of this thesis is examining the role of monetary policy in the Vietnamese economy, in terms of shocks to the economy via different channels, and the international dimension of the monetary transmission mechanism in the small, open economy of Vietnam. To answer these questions, the study uses quarterly data for the period 2000:1 to 2011:4 and the Structural Vector Autoregression (SVAR) approach. The SVAR is more suited than the Vector Autoregression (VAR) approach to examining structural shocks as a test of multivariate models. The findings show that the statistically significant break dates are found in this study, so a dummy variable is included in the SVAR model of Vietnam. The study’s findings reveal that the impacts of a monetary contraction on domestic variables are largely consistent with theories, except for its impact on price level. A monetary contraction causes the output to decrease, but weak. The monetary channels explain about 20 percent of fluctuations in real output. The higher output causes the domestic price to increase. A money shock is not a main reason in increasing the domestic price because of its small and statistically insignificant effects. Vietnam’s current price-controlling regimes are effective in ensuring price stability in spite of shocks in world oil and rice prices. The outcomes of this research illustrate that the interest rate channel is the most effective channel for transmission to the price fluctuations and the exchange rate for output variations. The study found the stock price channel as the least effective, which is consistent with the modest role of the stock market in the Vietnamese economy. This limits the statistically significant contemporaneous effects of monetary policy (the interest rate and credit) on stock prices. The monetary aggregate could not be a reliable tool to contemporaneously transmit monetary policy signals to the financial market. In addition, the study finds that domestic shocks have a more significant impact on the Vietnamese economy than foreign shocks do. Policymakers need to focus on solving the internal problems of the economy. However, they should keep a keen eye on some foreign factors in the short run because of significant effects of foreign output on domestic output, of foreign output on the monetary aggregate, of world gold price on the monetary aggregate, and of world rice price on the domestic price. In the analysis of aggregate demand components, significant contemporaneous relationships (the domestic price-exports, the domestic output-imports, and exports-stock prices) are evident. These relationships suggest policymakers’ cautious consideration on the trade-off between economic growth and price stability. Imports and exports are quickly affected by a monetary contraction; however, negative impacts on import demand contribute to improvements in Vietnam’s trade balance in the short run. The credit channel plays an important role in trade activities. The role of the exchange rate channel is less for prices, imports, and exports. Finally, the results illustrate that the effects of a monetary contraction on private investment and private consumption are consistent with economic theory and expectation, but these responses occur in a short time. The influence of monetary transmission channels on private consumption is higher than that on private investment. In this study, there is no evidence of the output and forward discount puzzles. The puzzles of price, liquidity and exchange rate are addressed but they are transitory, occurring in the short run and disappearing over time. Based on the major findings, this study suggests some policy recommendations: (i) there is a need to focus on solving the internal problems of the Vietnamese economy to create a strong motivation for the development of Vietnam; (ii) monitoring the important transmission channels, including the interest rate, exchange rate and credit channels in formulating monetary policy; coordinating monetary policy with other policies to effectively control inflation in Vietnam.",NA,"https://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/4286","Nguyen_2014_monetary",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,983

The model is constructed to incorporate the standard three-equation New Keynesian model as a special case. We refer to the parameterizations where demand shocks have expansionary effects regardless of the degree of price stickiness as Real Keynesian parameterizations. We use the model to show how the effects of monetary policy--for the same degree of price stickiness--differ depending whether the model parameters are within the Real Keynesian subset or not. In particular, we show that in the Real Keynesian subset, the effect of a monetary policy that tries to counter demand shocks creates the opposite tradeoff between inflation and output variability than under more traditional parameterizations. Moreover, we show that under the Real Keynesian parameterization neo-Fisherian effects emerge even though the equilibrium remains unique. We then estimate our extended sticky price model on U.S. data to see whether estimated parameters tend to fall within the Real Keynesian subset or whether they are more in line with the parameterization generally assumed in the New Keynesian literature. In passage, we use the model to justify a new SVAR procedure that offers a simple presentation of the data features which help identify the key parameters of the model. The main finding from our multiple estimations, and many robustness checks is that the data point to model parameters that fall within the Real Keynesian subset as opposed to a New Keynesian subset. We discuss both (i) how a Real Keynesian parametrization offers an explanation to puzzles associated with joint behavior of inflation and employment during the zero lower bound period and during the Great Moderation period, (ii) how it potentially changes the challenge faced by monetary policy if authorities want to achieve price stability and favor employment stability.",NA,"https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=eoh&AN=1710753&site=ehost-live","Beaudry_2018_real",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,985

This paper investigates asymmetries in the response of output to monetary policy shocks of different magnitude. Traditionally in the literature, the threshold determining which shocks are 'large' and which are 'small' has been imposed exogenously. To the extent that such a threshold is misspecified, tests for asymmetry will have low power. In this context, an unobserved components (UC) model of output with a TAR-driven transitory component augmented by a monetary policy variable is estimated. This framework makes it possible to introduce the threshold determining the size of monetary policy shocks as an additional parameter, instead of imposing an ad hoc definition. When the threshold is estimated from the data, there is strong statistical evidence that the response of output to monetary shocks of different sizes behaves asymmetrically. By contrast, when the threshold is imposed to be one standard deviation, linearity cannot be rejected. Moreover, the results found show some support for the implications of menu-cost models: smaller monetary shocks trigger a larger response on output. Second Chapter: ""Fiducial Distribution Confidence Intervals for Threshold Models with an Application to Credit-Market Crises"" (with Yunjong Eo and James Morley) We construct confidence intervals for threshold parameters of TAR processes. While there have been important advances in the asymptotic theory for inference in TAR models, their small sample properties have received much less attention. In this context, following Eo and Morley (2009), we propose a new method to construct confidence intervals for threshold parameters based on simulation of their marginal fiducial distributions (FD) from the likelihood function, by means of Markov-Chain Monte Carlo methods. Based on Monte Carlo experiments, we find that the FD confidence intervals for the threshold parameter have more accurate coverage rates and shorter expected length in comparison to bootstrap and asymptotic methods, even in small samples. We apply our method to a TAR model of the U.S. real GDP growth rate where the dynamics depend on whether credit conditions are tight or loose. Using our marginal FD approach, we find much tighter 95% confidence intervals for the threshold parameter that support the idea that recessions produced by credit crises exhibit largely transitory effects on the level of output. Third Chapter: ""Firm Heterogeneity, Imperfect Information and the Role of Aggregation in the Nonlinear Relationship Between Money and Output"" This paper addresses deeper empirical issues related to the role of aggregation in determining the nature of the nonlinear relationship between output and monetary policy variables. The results in Donayre (2009) support the notion that 'small' monetary shocks have larger effects on output than large shocks. However, the response of output associated with 'large' monetary shocks is not neutral as implied by menu-cost models. Thus, this paper argues that this difference between theory and empirical evidence might be caused by an aggregation problem. At the aggregate level, a particular monetary shock might be deemed small by some firms and large by others. That is, the response of output to monetary shocks is an average of the individual responses of firms and, as a consequence, that response is likely to capture the heterogeneity of behaviors. Moreover, when firms adjust their prices, they do not necessarily achieve the optimal price level, since they may face imperfect information. Based on this evidence, and using Markov-Chain Monte Carlo methods, an unobserved components model in which the transitory component is driven by a smooth transition autoregressive (STAR) process is estimated to account for the possibility of multiple (or a continuum of) thresholds, reflecting the heterogeneity of firms in the economy. A Bayesian estimation of TAR-driven and STAR-driven transitory components allows for a formal comparison of both processes and helps determining which one describes the nonlinear relationship between output and money better (Koop and Potter 1999, 2004).",NA,"https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=eoh&AN=1143140&site=ehost-live","Donayre_2010_inferences",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,986

The study established that, the stock markets of the 12 African countries are positively affected contemporaneously by their respective monetary policies through the interest rate channel, but could not find evidence to the reverse reaction. The study then estimated impulse response functions and thus established that both money supply and real interest rate decline in response to positive and negative stock market shocks respectively, whiles inflation responds positively to a negative stock market shock. Using the forecast error variance decompositions (fevds), we establish that between the two monetary policy stances considered (money supply and real interest rate), real interest rate has the greatest influence on the stock market and inflation. Conversely, the stock market turns to exert greater influence on real interest rate than it does on money supply, therefore indicating a reverse relationship between monetary policy and the stock market. Similar reverse relationships among the other variables have been observed.

Moreover, a common U.S. monetary policy does not fit all; it may have asymmetric effects on the economic performance across states, particularly at times of high dispersion in the household debt imbalances, as it may have been the case around the Great Recession.","10.1111/jmcb.12547","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/jmcb.12547","Albuquerque_2019_one",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,1010

The accumulated deficits and public debts have escalated, thus casted doubts on the capacity of fiscal expansion to endure economic growth. Yet, the limited empirical evidences are far from conclusive. This paper examines the Malaysian budget deficit-economic growth nexus during 1980-2018, with other macroeconomics variables (e.g. interest rate, inflation, exchange rate, domestic investment) taken into consideration. To capture the dynamic relationship, a set of comprehensive econometric procedures has been employed, including cointegration, Granger causality, error correction modelling, impulse response function and variance decomposition. Our analysis reveals that budget deficits contributed to economic growth and were bounded together with macroeconomic variables in both the long-run and short run with different magnitudes and shock adjustments. In brief, GDP is negatively linked to budget deficits, foreign exchange rate and interest rate, but positively linked with domestic investment and inflation. In addition, budget deficits exhibited bidirectional causality with domestic investment, and showed unidirectional causal effect on GDP. The finding would suggest that increases of budget deficits and domestic investment promotes economic productivity. Monetary expansion with lower interest rate and exchange rate appreciation would help to correct budget deficits but the impacts are minor, due to less-profound financial deepening. A balancing and well-coordinated public finance policy would help to sustain economic growth.",NA,"https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=eoh&AN=1866663&site=ehost-live","Yew_2019_three",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,1011

In particular, the answers to the following questions are of a critical importance for understanding the efficacy of fiscal and monetary policy interventions: 1) how much does government spending stimulate GDP? 2) how nominally rigid are prices and do these rigidities differ across sectors of the economy? In this dissertation I use state-of-the-art macroeconometric techniques to shed new light on the answers to these fundamental, but unresolved, economic questions. Firstly, I extend the Markov-switching vector autoregressive (MS-VAR) framework to allow for the estimation of models with multiple regime-switching processes governing distinct sets of model parameters. Secondly, using my extensions of the MS-VAR framework, I estimate a model to investigate the extent to which the fiscal multiplier varies over time and what factors cause the time variation. Lastly, I estimate a Dynamic Stochastic General Equilibrium (DSGE) model that has multiple production sectors to assess the extent of heterogeneity in nominal rigidities across sectors and the role these rigidities play in the transmission of monetary policy shocks to real economic variables. Throughout the dissertation I use Bayesian methods for statistical inference, which are based on the likelihood function implied by the macroeconomic model. I find that the government spending multiplier varies over time and, contrary to other recent results in the literature, it varies countercyclically. The results of the MS-VAR estimation suggests that ""expansionary"" fiscal policy may not expand GDP at the economy most badly needs an expansionary policy intervention and, furthermore, that current DSGE models may suffer from misspecification along dimensions important for evaluating the effects of fiscal policies. With regards to assessing nominal rigidities, I find that the choice of estimation method is key in evaluating the extent of nominal rigidities in multi-sector DSGE models.

This paper argues that, in studying monetary transmission mechanism process, consideration should be given to its impact on policy and less emphasis on random shocks basically because shocks account for less fraction of the policy instruments inconsistency. It further argues that the effects of monetary transmission mechanism on economic aggregates requires structurally modeling rather than VAR framework that lack policy direction as well as any meaningful economic interpretation. The paper therefore presents a structural model estimated using the Vector Error Correction (VEC) technique to determine the effect of interest rate channel of monetary transmission mechanism on the real economy variables considered. Our findings show that money supply, expected inflation, real interest rate and exchange rate are crucial for any meaningful economic growth, suggesting that manipulation of these variables is essential for the effectiveness of monetary policy in Nigeria.

Indeed, in a context of wage rigidity, a tightening monetary policy results in a slowdown in the activity level and an increase in the unemployment rate.

Hence, the main aim of this paper is to evaluate the relationship among these variables by applying dynamic panel data approach for 23 private and governmental banks during the 2008-2019. Method: For achieving this purpose, at first the inflationary environments have been extracted by Markov- Switching and then, by utilizing dynamic panel data and GMM estimator the short-run relationship between variables have been tested. Results: The empirical findings of this paper indicated that the first order lag of bank deposits has a positive and significant effect on the volume of deposits in current year and its amount is equal to 0.17. Also, the variable of the interaction of liquidity growth rate with severe inflation environments and banks 'legal reserve ratio has a negative and significant effect on private banks' deposit volume and the variables of long-term deposit interest rate, real GDP growth rate and liquidity quality have a positive and significant effect on deposit volume. State-owned banks are positive and meaningful, consistent with theoretical expectations. The deposit profit rate has positive and other monetary policy variables such as liquidity growth rate and rule of deposits ratio and cross effect of liquidity money growth with inflationary environment have negative impact on the total deposits of Banks. Regarding the negative and significant effect of the interaction of liquidity growth rate with high inflation environments, it can be argued that with increasing liquidity and increasing demand, the general level of prices increases and consequently inflation rate increases and the economy enters a severe inflation environment, so expect as inflation intensifies, demand for deposits in banks will decrease and the incentive to invest in alternative environments such as the foreign exchange market, gold and other assets will increase. In addition, the value of Sargan test statistics indicates that the null hypothesis is not rejected and the instrumental variables defined in the model are valid. Because the value of this test statistic shows that the instrument variables defined are not correlated with the error terms. It is worth noting that in this estimate, due to the shorter period of time under study, the second-order interval of the volume of deposits of private and state-owned banks is considered as an instrument variable. According to the results of Arellano & Bond, it can be inferenced that the order of self-correlation between the disorder sentences was of the first order. Therefore, this method is a best method to eliminate the fixed effects of the model. Conclusion: Considering the negative and significant effect of the interaction of liquidity growth rate with inflationary environments on the deposit volume of the banking sector, it is suggested that economic policymakers apply contractionary monetary policies to control and decrease the volume of liquidity and control the general level of prices and inflation. Provide calm and gentle inflationary environments as well as increase the investment of individuals and legal entities with banks and help increase their deposits.","10.22103/jdc.2021.18019.1147","https://jdc.uk.ac.ir/article_3090.html","Shaliha_2021_the",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,1023

On the one hand, exposure to global financial cycles dampens the output effect of a tightening in monetary policy in financially integrated economies and thereby reduces monetary policy effectiveness. On the other hand, another salient feature of financial globalisation is that economies have become increasingly net long in foreign currency, which amplifies monetary policy effectiveness: economies experience larger valuation losses and wealth effects on their external balance sheets in response to an exchange rate appreciation when monetary policy is tightened, hence triggering stronger output effects. We quantify empirically the net impact of financial globalisation on monetary policy effectiveness through these two opposing channels. We find that since the 1990s the second channel has dominated so that financial globalisation has amplified monetary policy effectiveness in the typical advanced and emerging market economy. By our estimates, the output effect of a tightening in monetary policy has increased by 25% due to financial globalisation.

The first chapter (joint work with Marco Airaudo) studies the existence of Stochastic Consistent Expectations Equilibria (SCEE) in linear Markov regime switching models. A SCEE exists when the model-implied mean and first-order autocorrelation coincide with those predicted by the agents via misspecified forecasting rules. For a simple regime switching monetary policy model, the parametric space where at least one SCEE exists is rather wide, and may extend well beyond the rational expectations equilibrium determinacy frontier. Misspecified expectations combined with regime-switching yield a strong endogenous amplification mechanism that helps generate the near unit root dynamics for inflation observed in the U.S. before the Great Moderation. The second chapter considers a New Keynesian model in which agents form expectations based on a combination of misspecified forecasts and myopia. The proposed expectations formation process is tested against Rational Expectations (RE), as well other assumptions about expectations, with inflation forecasting data from the U.S. Survey of Professional Forecasters. The paper then derives the general equilibrium solution consistent with the proposed expectations formation process and estimates the model with likelihood-based Bayesian methods. The paper yields three novel results: (i) Data strongly prefer the combination of autoregressive misspecified forecasting rules and myopia over other alternatives, including RE; (ii) The best fitting expectations formation process for both households and firms is characterized by high degrees of myopia and simple AR(1) forecasting rules; (iii) Despite the absence of real rigidities typically found necessary for New Keynesian models with RE, the estimated model with autoregressive forecasts and myopia generates substantial internal persistence and amplification to exogenous shocks. The third chapter proves that in Full-Information RE models with exogenous Markov regime shifts, ex-post regime-dependent forecasting errors can be described by available information at the time of forecast and ex-ante forecasting revisions, separately. In economic environments with structural changes, the FIRE hypothesis gives rise to waves of over- and under-response of forecasters to current events as well as new aggregate information at the time of forecast. Using inflation and output growth forecasting data from the Survey of Professional Forecasters, the paper presents new evidence of such waves, consistent with implications of Full-Information RE in models with regime shifts. Finally, the framework and insights are generalized to any dynamic stochastic general equilibrium model with exogenous Markov shifts, whose RE solution can be written as a Markov Switching VAR process.",NA,"https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=eoh&AN=1935767&site=ehost-live","Hajdini_2021_essays",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,1028

The exchange rate was the main channel of monetary policy transmission during that time frame. Furthermore, inflation sensitivity to the interest rate is low. Thus, a rise in the basic interest rate (Selic) generates relatively small benefits (a fall in inflation). However, an interest rate increase generates substantial costs: a slowdown in economic activity, the appreciation of the exchange rate, and an increase in public debt. Inflations low sensitivity to interest rates is seen as a result of problems in the transmission mechanism: a broken transmission mechanism reduces the efficiency of monetary policy. Price stability under ITR thus requires an excessively rigid monetary policy. The final outcome is, on the one hand, that inflation hardly gives in. 0n the other hand, the costs of high interest rates escalate.

Based on this, we formulated the main objective: to identify the impact of monetary policies on the dynamics of financial markets development, labor markets, and the markets for goods and services. As part of the applied methodology, the impact of the quantitative easing on the government bond yields curve was based on an indirect assessment using the seemingly unrelated regression model, considering the use of parameters from the functional benchmark form. Through the vector error correction model, another additional impact of the application of the monetary policy mechanisms on selected indicators of the considered markets was identified.

Applying the changes identified by the above models allowed us to determine the expected change in the rate of growth of the aggregate output of the euro area countries. Based on our results, we found out that Asset Purchase Programme had an impact on the growth of government bond yields issued by euro area countries, on lowering the risk rate on corporate bond markets, and increasing the nominal value of shares. In addition, growth in inflation and a decline in interest rates were affected.

It consists of three chapters. Chapter 1 explores the dynamics of monetary transmission mechanism. As China's domestic financial markets deepen and develop further toward a market-based system, the country's monetary policy transmission should continue to improve in the sense that the policy instrument's influence on economic conditions increases in magnitude and stabilized across time. Using a short-term key interest rate as a standard monetary policy tool and time-varying parameter techniques, this study empirically demonstrates that China's monetary policy framework is in the midst of transitioning to a market-based approach, and the analysis more closely examines the emerging monetary transmission mechanism in the modern era. Chapter 2 investigates the exchange rate pass-through to domestic inflation along various distribution stages in China. Exchange rate movement is correlated with consumer prices both via their direct pass-through effect, and indirectly through its impacts on input and producer prices, which, in turn, affect final consumer prices. The baseline results are compared between the recursive vector autoregressive and vector error correction models. An appreciation of the yuan is estimated to suppress inflationary pressure at various stages along the distribution chain in the domestic market. By incorporating the long-run information, compared to the recursive case, the error correction estimation reveals stronger pass-through effect to consumer price. Various modifications and cointegration restrictions are examined for robustness. Chapter 3 examines the effects of fiscal policy, as a change in government spending or taxes on macroeconomic variables comprising inflation, output and interest rates. The two central issues concerning fiscal policy makers are macroeconomic stability and growth stimulation. Built on the Blanchard-Perotti identification approach, this paper empirically analyzed the influence of fiscal policy to aggregate economic activity, and the effectiveness of fiscal policy instruments when compared to advanced economies. The findings suggest that, inflation positively responds to fiscal shocks, and output is positively correlated with tax revenue; however, a government spending shock tends to be neutral.",NA,"https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=eoh&AN=1807325&site=ehost-live","Ji_2019_empirical",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,1053

This paper considers the relative importance of two of these hypotheses.  First, global imbalances increased liquidity in the US financial system, driving down long-term real interest rates.  Second, the Federal Reserve kept interest rates low in the first half of the 2000s.  Both factors reduced the cost of borrowing and may have encouraged the boom in house prices.  This paper develops an empirical framework to separate the relative contributions of these two factors to the US housing market.  The results suggest that capital inflows to the United States played a bigger role in generating the increase in house prices than monetary policy loosening.  Using VAR methods, we find that compared to monetary policy, the effect of a capital inflows shock on US house prices and residential investment is about twice as large and substantially more persistent.  Results from variance decompositions suggest that, at a forecast horizon of 20 quarters, capital flows shocks explain 15% of the variation in real house prices, while monetary policy shocks explain only 5%.  In a simple counterfactual exercise, we find that if the ratio of the current account deficit to GDP had remained constant since the end of 1998, real house prices by the end of 2007 would have been 13% lower.

Linear regression have been exploited to analyze the impact of both monetary and non-monetary factors on gross domestic product dynamics of Poland, Check Republic, Slovakia and Hungary. The study have revealed that both monetary and non-monetary factors have impact on GDP dynamics of the Visegrad Group countries, but household final consumption, exports of goods and services, inflation, high-technology exports and broad money growth show the highest correlation with GDP of the countries. All regression models consider GDP dynamics as dependent variable. Collinearity of certain predictor variables have not allowed using the most significant factors to develop linear regression models. As a result, independent variables sets are not those of the highest statistical significance. Therefore, regression model of Poland includes inflation, high-technology exports and real interest rate as predictor variables. Regression model of Check Republic shows the correlation between GDP dynamics as dependent variable and high technology exports, domestic credit provided by financial sector and broad money growth as independent ones. The following independent variables are used to develop the regression line of Slovakia: domestic credit provided by financial sector and broad money growth. Linear regression model of Hungary includes inflation and foreign direct investment as predictors. The study have confirmed the strong positive effect making by foreign direct investment on economic growth of the post-communist countries.

In the presence of nominal or financial frictions, when interest rates increase, the real cost of owning a house increases, and this increase may make some people prefer to rent instead of buying. This change in consumption behavior increases the price of rents relative to other goods. Starting in 1983, homeownership costs are based on a measure of implied owner equivalent rent, which is calculated using observed house rents. This change implies that, directly and indirectly, prices in the rental market almost entirely command the shelter component of CPI, which weighs around 30% in the overall index. When we take these two pieces into account and use CPI net of shelter services as a measure of inflation, we obtain impulse responses of prices to a monetary contraction shock more in line with what is predicted by theory. In addition, our results also suggest that inflation is much less persistent than what is implied by analyses using a measure of inflation that includes shelter services.

The consequence is strengthening of domestic inflationary pressures and appreciation of the exchange rate. This paper examines counter-cyclicality of monetary policy and the role of fiscal policy in this regard. The stance of fiscal policy and the manner of financing government expenditures have a significant effect on the conduct of monetary policy. Our empirical observations indicate that, fiscal and monetary policies in Iran are generally expansionary, particularly during economic booms, often resulting in subsequent large depreciation of the domestic currency followed by higher inflation rates and economic slowdown. Under fiscal dominance, monetary policy is ineffective and both targets and instruments of monetary policy will not be under the control of the central bank. A structurally balanced fiscal rule that maintains an aligned exchange rate allows effective countercyclical monetary policies and discourages excessive foreign financing.

It is becoming clear from literature that financial reforms can change the monetary transmission by changing the overall impact of the policy or by altering the transmission channels overtime. Therefore, the impact of monetary policy on price stability and output growth can vary and portray delayed effects overtime. The paper finds that inflation and real output responses to monetary policy shocks changed over the period under the review. Importantly, beginning mid-2000s, the monetary transmission performed consistently with predictions of economic theory partly due to stable macroeconomic conditions and positive structural changes in the economy.

A standard monetary VAR shows that the transmission of unconventional monetary policy in the euro area is quite different: prices react more quickly, but the response of output is delayed and weaker. A block-restricted VAR is then used to measure the spillover of ECB policy abroad. The importance of euro area monetary policy for macroeconomic developments is confirmed for all six countries. A conventional monetary shock affects inflation and output in largely the same way as within the euro area. Unconventional measures have generated a variety of responses.

As our object is to let the data expose the key determinants of prices and output, we resort to a broad aggregate demand-aggregate supply model consisting of three markets: goods, money, and labor. Taken as a whole, the empirical evidence suggests that monetary expansions are basically accommodated through a higher price level, rather than a higher economic activity. In the short run, real exchange rate depreciations produce a moderate effect on inflation and an insignificant effect on output. In the long run, however, an undervalued currency results in production losses. In addition, we find that i) both inertial inflation and inflationary expectations are among the driving forces of price instability, and ii) shocks to nominal wages are recessionary at impact and this negative effect is persistent over time. Lastly, nominal wages are a positive function of capacity utilization and the expected rate of inflation, thereby suggesting a forward-looking wage adjustment process.

The model has two aggregate shocks: a monetary policy shock and a technology shock. Firms observe idiosyncratic noisy signals about these shocks and face strategic complementarities in price setting. In this environment, agents'""forecasting the forecasts of others"" can produce realistic dynamics of model variables, with associated highly persistent real effects of monetary shocks and delayed effects of such shocks on inflation. The paper provides a full Bayesian analysis of the model, revealing that it can capture the persistent propagation of monetary shocks only by predicting that firms acquire less information about monetary policy than about technology. To further investigate this finding, I augment the model to allow firms to optimally choose how much information to acquire about the two shocks, subject to an information-processing constraint a la Sims (2003). This constraint sets the rate at which firms can substitute pieces of information about the two shocks. I find that, in the estimated model, firms' marginal value of the information about monetary policy shocks is much higher than that about technology shocks. I argue that this finding admits two alternative interpretations. First, firms acquire implausibly too little information about the monetary shock in the estimated model. Second, the rate of substitution implied by the information-processing constraint is inconsistent with the data. In the third chapter, I develop a model where firms have incomplete and dispersed information to study how monetary policy effects agents' beliefs. I estimate the model through Bayesian methods and find that dispersed information has two main implications for monetary policy. First, it reduces the real effects of money.

Essentially, monetary authority responds positively and contemporaneously to output and inflationary pressures. Inflation is mostly driven by interest rate shock over the medium to long term, pointing to an impact of monetary policy. In the short term, however, exchange rate shock has relatively larger influence on inflation than that emanating from interest rate.

We then quantify the policy contribution on GDP growth in the last decade by means of a structural counterfactual analysis based on conditional forecasts. We find that global GDP growth benefited from substantial policy support during the global financial crisis but policy tightening thereafter, particularly fiscal consolidation, acted as a significant drag on the subsequent global recovery.

We use Canada, Mexico, and the United States to test the feasibility of a monetary union by documenting whether: 1) gross investments in Canada and Mexico are equally responsive to the real fund rate, and 2) Canada and Mexico's output growth and inflation respond differently to US monetary policy shocks and oil price shocks.

We estimated SVARs for the periods 1970-2008, 1970-1990, and 1991-2008 to find that a monetary union is feasible between Canada and the US for the first two sample periods. For Canada and Mexico, we find similar responses of output growth to US monetary policy shocks. We conducted further robustness tests by estimating two identified VARs with common US variables and oil prices for Canada and Mexico to assess commonality in responses to shocks with the US.

In both cases, the predictive power of money, for the prices and output, significantly increases when asset prices are considered in the model.

These changes in the aggregate impact of monetary policy can be explained by several important changes in the monetary transmission mechanism and in the composition of macroeconomic and credit aggregates.

It is important to study the influence channel of monetary policies on the real economy. Based on the structural VAR model, this study uses the monthly data from the Chinese financial sector and actual macroeconomic variables from January 2001 to December 2020 to analyze the influence channel of monetary policy and its impact on the real economy in order to find out about the effectiveness of monetary policy. Focusing on before and after the global financial crisis, this study elaborates on the transmission effects of monetary policy before and after the global financial crisis. The results are as follows. In terms of the impact of rising interest rates, before and after the global financial crisis, industrial production continued to be negatively affected for a long time and consumer prices continued to increase during this period leading to price difficulties. In addition, the money supply and the RMB exchange rate decreased. Due to the shock of rising interest rates, stock indexes have fallen as predicted according to the economic theories. Moreover, because of the shock of rising interest rate, higher money supply, industrial production situation was unexpected before and after the global financial crisis, which led to a positive effect on consumer prices in the short-term. The change of RMB exchange rate was not obvious statistically, but there was a negative effect. During this period, stock indexes was the opposite of expectation. The impact of some macroeconomic variables on monetary policy can be seen as different from predictions based on economic theories and it doesn’t have much statistical significance, indicating the lack of effectiveness and transmission effect of monetary policy. The influence channel and effects of monetary policies are similar to the black box. Inevitably there will be changes in the financial markets and the real economy according to the specific conditions. It also means the influence channel and effects of monetary policy don’t play a vital role. It takes a long time for monetary policies to affect the real economy. Therefore, to maximize the effect of monetary policies, it is essential to determine the current economic situation and implement the policies. Furthermore, it is vital to actively improve the financial market system. Hence, it will be possible to enhance the efficiency of financial resource allocation and enable the financial market to do its roles in structural adjustment and risk prevention.",NA,"https://www.earticle.net/Article/A410073","Hao_2022_monetary",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,1121

The ultimate goal is to aid in the appropriate design and implementation of monetary policy for the attainment of developmental goals. The dissertation empirically explores four issues on the pricing, behavioural and output implications of monetary policy. The four questions that the dissertation attempts to answer in Chapters Two to Five respectively are: 1) Does the effectiveness of monetary policy transmission depend on the financial development of an economy? 2) Can monetary policy be used as a tool in easing pressure on domestic currencies in the foreign exchange market? 3) Do banks engage in excessively risky behaviour when monetary policy is expansionary? 4) Does monetary policy influence aggregate variables like private capital formation, growth and their interrelationships? Chapter Two tests the completeness of the pass-through of the central bank policy rate to bank lending rates on one hand, and the interest rate pass-through as a function of the level of financial development on the other hand. The results show that the pass-through of central bank policy rate to bank lending rates is asymmetric for three Anglophone West African countries, namely: Gambia, Ghana and Nigeria, which are seeking to ascend onto a single monetary framework. However, there is no evidence that financial development affects the pass-through of monetary policy. These findings still prove relevant, especially with regard to the quest for effective monetary policy implementation and the ascension onto a single monetary framework by these 3 countries. The motivation for this study stemmed from policy discussions and academic debates on the premise that financial development is a key element in the pursuit of effective monetary policy implementation, focusing on the three Anglophone West African countries between 1975 and 2011. The study employs the bounds testing approach to cointegration, and the Autoregressive Distributed Lags (ARDL) by Pesaran et al., (2001). The findings show significant differences in the interest rate pass-through of the 3 countries studied. Ghana and Gambia were characterised by undershooting in the response of lending rates to monetary policy changes whilst Nigeria was characterised by overshooting in bank lending rates. Financial development proved significant in some, but not in all the cases, while economic growth proved mostly insignificant in the transmission of the policy rate to bank lending rates In Chapter Three, we show that contractionary monetary policy of high interest rates is able to correct disequilibrium in the foreign currency market in selected countries in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). The chapter also provides empirical evidence about the impact of macroeconomic fundamentals on the domestic foreign exchange market. The study assesses the impact of monetary policy on foreign exchange market pressure (EMP) in developing country contexts focusing on some selected countries in SSA. EMP is the sum of exchange rate depreciation and change in foreign reserves that is required to restore equilibrium to the domestic foreign exchange market. The study was motivated by the fact that most of the SSA countries are developing economies that have negative net export positions and stand to lose significantly from consistently deteriorating foreign exchange positions. This study thus sought to measure the ability of monetary policy to significantly address currency pressures that arise from trading on the global market. The hypothesis that a tighter monetary policy stance can lend strength to a currency was tested in this study using Generalised Methods of Moments (GMM) estimation in a dynamic panel setting. Data on 20 SSA economies for which data were available for the period 1991 to 2010 are used.

It aims at achieving six objectives. First, it investigates not only the channels associated with monetary-policy-induced changes in the financial markets but also those associated with the monetary-policy-induced changes in the goods market. Second, it assesses and compares the relative strength of each channel of monetary policy transmission, which has not been attempted previously in the case of the Indonesia. This attempt is made possible by the use of a single model to investigate the multiple channels of monetary policy transmission. Third, it examines whether the 1998 financial crisis has changed the course of each channel of monetary policy transmission. Specifically, whether the role played by each channel in the monetary policy transmission weakened or strengthened is investigated. Fourth, to achieve these objectives a structural vector autoregressive (SVAR) model of the Indonesian economy is constructed. However, before these objectives are addressed the issue of whether the monetary policy shocks have plausible macroeconomic effects is dealt with. To that end, a nonrecursive identifying strategy is applied. Likewise, the complexity of the actual monetary policy conduct in Indonesia that makes it hard to single out the monetary policy instruments actually in use in Indonesia is mitigated by devising eight SVAR specifications. Fifth, it addresses the issue of non-stationary data in VAR modelling by conducting unit root test that allows for one and two endogenouslydetermined breaks. Specifically, this study examines the robustness of the Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) unit root test to the presence of one and/or more structural breaks. Given the fact that most time series data have structural breaks, such an attempt has not been done in the case of Indonesia. Finally, it attempts to solve the identification problem associated with bank lending channel using cointegration procedures based on the autoregressive distributive lag (ARDL) model and the impulse response function analysis that have not been applied to an Indonesian case. (One advantage of the ARDL approach is that it is appropriate irrespective of whether the time series data used are integrated of degree one or zero). SVAR model specification that captures the most plausible effects of monetary policy shocks is selected out of eight specifications of the SVAR model of the Indonesian economy estimated using both monthly and quarterly data from 1984M12- 2003M12 (1984Q4-2003Q4). The eight different SVAR models are estimated out of the fact that in reality there are four potential measures of monetary aggregates: total reserves, base money, narrow money (M1) and broad money (M2) and two potential measures of short-term interest rates: interbank call-money rate (R1) and SBI rate (interest rate on Bank Indonesia bills) (R2) as monetary policy instruments. Based on the estimated impulse response analyses, the specification that best captures the effects of monetary policy shocks, as expected by theory, is selected. Overall, the monthly eight-variable SVAR specification that uses M2 as measure of monetary aggregate and R1 as short-term interest rate is superior to the other specifications. However, the quarterly version of the same specification is superior to all other specifications because it resolves the exchange rate puzzle (the initial depreciation of exchange rate following a monetary tightening). This model specification is used to empirically assess the relative strength of channels associated with the monetary-policyinduced changes in the financial and goods markets. In regards to the latter, it has shown empirically, relying on the concept of contribution derived from estimated SVAR models, that consumption spending plays a predominant role in the monetary transmission mechanisms. This result is more in line with the findings regarding the United States than with those regarding the Europe and Japan. For the latter countries investment spending is predominant in the monetary transmission mechanisms. As for the channels associated with the monetary-policy-induced changes in the financial markets, this study finds that bank loans are dominant. The accumulated response of output attributed to this channel is stronger than the exchange rate and asset price channels. A monetary tightening shock leads to a fall in bank credit, with a lag of about three quarters. However, the importance of bank loans has been exaggerated by the credit crunch during the financial crisis period. The role of bank loans is weaker during the period before the financial crisis, although stronger than the other two channels. The finding on the bank lending channel suffers an identification problem: do the monetary-policy-induced movements in bank loans originate from the supply or demand side? The “credit view” of monetary policy transmission requires that the former is the case. The estimation of error correction models where the cointegating vectors allow for one structural break and are based on the Johansen’s and Autoregressive Distributive Lag (ARDL) procedures find that the former is the case. Further, the impulse response analysis based on both vector error correction (VEC) models of the bank loans market and the eight-variable SVAR corroborates this result irrespective of the origin of shock, monetary policy or otherwise. Likewise, the first requirement of the credit view that a monetary tightening by the central bank is capable of constraining the supply of bank loans is satisfied. Similarly, this analysis also satisfies the second requirement of the credit view that the monetary-induced decline in the supply of bank loans depresses aggregate spending due to the significance of the bank-dependent borrowers. Thus, the bank lending channel is confirmed. The exchange rate channel is found to be the weakest. The reason is that during and after the financial crisis there are anomalies associated with this channel. The exchange rate channel operates against the conventional wisdom. A monetary tightening shock is accompanied by exchange rate depreciation and subsequently weakening the level of economic activity. These anomalies disappear when the estimation covers observations before the financial crisis only. These anomalies are due to the fact that during the crisis period the exchange rate depreciation was so enormous that monetary policy tightening had little or no effect in arresting the depreciation pressure. Further, since Indonesia is a highly indebted economy the enormous exchange rate depreciation has inflated the foreign-currency-denominated debts and hence greatly worsened firms’ balance sheets, thereby depressing firms’ investment and productive capacity and hence the level of economic activity. As for the asset price channel, the results reveal that the equity price channel is also weaker than the bank loans channel but slightly stronger than the exchange rate channel. Due to the collapse of stock market and sharp decrease in the use of equity financing during the financial crisis period, the equity price channel of monetary policy transmission had weakened during that period. Further, to the extent that this channel follows Monetarist view or Tobin’s view, the latter seems to play a dominant role. That is, the real effect of this channel is mainly due to investment spending increases spurred by higher Tobin’s q resulting from the increase in stock price following a monetary easing. Finally, this study also confirms the occurrence of credit crunch following the financial crisis.",NA,"https://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/640","Afandi_2005_monetary",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,1138

In the post sub-prime crisis period, however, there has been an overwhelming intellectual support for revisiting the issue of whether monetary policy should become more sensitive to asset price trends and respond proactively to prevent any build up of bubbles. In the Indian context, this paper provides empirical evidence to explain the relevance of a policy of no direct use of the interest rate instrument for stabilising asset price cycles. While the asset price channel of monetary policy is clearly visible in empirical estimates, there is no evidence of monetary policy responding to asset price developments directly. Asset price changes also do not seem to influence the inflation path, as per the impulse response analysis in a structural VAR model. This suggests why monetary policy may continue to refrain from responding directly to asset price cycles. Credit market shocks, however, explain a significant proportion of asset price variations over medium to long run, which though could be part of a broader comovement of variables over the business cycle, as visible in terms of simultaneous movement in real activity, credit flows and asset prices. Higher interest rates seem to lead to contraction in output, credit demand as well as asset prices; hence, only the impact on asset prices should not be viewed as a good enough reason to use monetary policy for stabilising asset price cycles. The financial stability concerns from asset price bubbles could be better addressed through micro and macro-prudential measures, and the effectiveness of such measures could be enhanced when implemented in a sound macroeconomic policy environment.",NA,"https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=eoh&AN=1670573&site=ehost-live","Singh_2012_monetary",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,1141

Monetary policy is non-neutral, for it moves the real rate, thus alters agents' intertemporal consumption decisions. The standard model is a simplified world without information frictions or regional heterogeneity. In a world with information frictions, monetary policy actions communicate to the public about the central bank's private information. Monetary policy can generate additional effects by shaping agents' beliefs about the true state of the economy or the future monetary policy path. In a world with regional heterogeneity, monetary policy can have interesting interactions with local characteristics. This dissertation investigates regime-dependent, state-dependent, and heterogeneous regional effects of monetary policy. Chapter 1 introduces a new regime dependence of monetary policy due to information frictions: the effects of monetary policy shocks depend on the type of the fundamental macro shock in the economy. Specifically, output responses to monetary policy shocks are amplified relative to their counterparts in perfect information models when the fundamental macro shock is a productivity level shock or a demand shock. In contrast, output responses are dampened when the fundamental macro shock is a productivity growth rate shock. Households observe the overall fundamental in the economy but cannot distinguish its persistent part from its temporary part. The central bank sets the interest rate tracking a function of the persistent fundamental plus a monetary policy shock, so the interest rate is a noisy signal about the persistent fundamental with the monetary policy shock as the noise. Exogenous monetary policy shocks lead households to update their perceptions about the persistent fundamental differently facing varying types of fundamental macro shocks, thus generating heterogeneous effects on output. Chapter 2 introduces the position effect: the effects of a monetary policy shock depend on its relative position in the monetary policy sequence. I use both event study and local projections methods to investigate how the effects of monetary policy depend on the relative position of monetary policy shocks in monetary policy sequences. The effects of monetary policy are less potent in the first half of monetary policy sequences, which I phrase as the position effect. Possible explanations include different implicit forward guidance, different information effects, and Fed's different interest rate smoothing behavior at different positions in the monetary policy sequence. I provide supporting evidence for the interest rate smoothing behavior: less interest rate smoothing in the first half of a monetary policy sequence shortens the shock duration, thus weakening the effect. Chapter 3, joint work with Ninghui Li, investigates the regional heterogeneity of monetary policy on local house prices. House prices in growing urban areas are more sensitive to monetary policy. We first define urban growth and urban decline using CBSA level population data and then test local house prices to monetary policy shocks using local projections. The housing supply elasticity does not drive our results, although it plays a role in house price dynamics. We find evidence supporting that the effect of monetary policy interacts with the long-run expectations driven by local population growth.",NA,"https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=eoh&AN=1936180&site=ehost-live","Shen_2021_essays",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,1144

Moreover, the impacts are volatile in the short-term, but stabilise after 10 periods.

Second, both shocks exhibit a distinct pattern over our sample period. More specifically, we find small output effects of a conventional monetary policy shock during the period of the global financial crisis and stronger effects in its aftermath. This might imply that when the central bank has left the policy rate unaltered for an extended period of time, a policy surprise might boost output particularly strongly. By contrast, the spread shock has affected output growth most strongly during the period of the global financial crisis and less so thereafter.

The focal point is to investigate the differential of monetary policy effects across sub‐sector firms' investment by examining the role of interest rates, and broad credit channel of monetary transmission. Design/methodology/approach – The following research design has been employed in examining the relevance of both monetary policy channels. First, the firm user cost of capital as a proxy for the interest rates channel is constructed. Second, the neoclassical model of firm‐level investment function has been estimated using the dynamic panel data technique. Findings – The results revealed that the monetary policy transmission mechanism works through both interest rate, and broad credit channels in influencing firms' investment spending in the Malaysian economy. Monetary policy has heterogeneous effects in respect of sub‐sectors of the economy. In the long‐run, the firm investment in the consumer products and services sectors are significantly affected by the interest rate and broad credit channels. However, the firm investment in the industrial products and property sectors has only been significantly affected by interest rates and broad credit channel, respectively. Originality/value – The empirical results provide new evidence on the microeconomic effects of monetary policy in a small open economy (i.e. Malaysia) in two dimensions. First, this finding has supported the relevance of interest rates and broad credit channel of monetary transmission in a small open economy. Second, monetary policy effects are also heterogeneous by sub‐sectors of the economy, as some sectors (for example, consumer products, industrial products, and services) are significantly affected by monetary policy, and other sub‐sectors (for example, property) are not affected.","10.1108/10867371211266919","https://doi.org/10.1108/10867371211266919","Abdul Karim_2012_monetary",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,1155

"ref_1177","12",2365,"L22EZ4EK","Skaperdas, Arsenios","Essays in Monetary Economics",2016,NA,NA,NA,"thesis","This dissertation focuses broadly on central bank intervention: under what conditions, and when, can stabilization policy be effective? As growth lags across the globe, central banks have become lead actors in spurring recovery from the Global Financial Crisis. In response, a large academic literature has developed in order to theoretically predict and measure to what extent central bank policies have succeeded in stimulating growth. The first two chapters of this dissertation focus on US monetary policy. I develop two new approaches for investigating the effectiveness of monetary policy at the ""zero lower bound"", that is, when interest rates are near zero. A novelty of these approaches is the usage of firm- and industry-level data in order to investigate effects of monetary policy. The zero bound on interest rates is the problem that--given low growth since 2008--the Federal Reserve would likely have lowered the federal funds rate further in to maximize employment and increase inflation. Previous behavior suggests that the Fed would have reduced the federal funds rate to a trough of 5 percentage points below zero. According to accepted empirics (Coibion 2012), a contractionary 5% monetary shock should lower GDP growth by a peak of 2.5%. This dissertation leverages the fact that the industry effects of detrimental monetary policy would be heterogeneous: a substantial portion of this reduction in growth would occur in industries such as construction, which typically would respond with a 10% reduction in revenues to a 5% contractionary monetary shock. In contrast, health care and other industries do not tend to respond as much to interest rates changes, and would thus likely be unaffected The first approach of this dissertation shows that growth rates of industries historically sensitive to interest rate changes, and therefore to monetary policy, do not seem to have fared poorly at the zero lower bound. This suggests that monetary policy was sufficiently accommodative since 2009 in spite of the zero bound constraint. The second approach quantifies the federal funds rate that would be implied by observed industry growth rates and macroeconomic variables following 2008. The results suggest that unconventional policy had an effect on the economy such that growth occurred as if the federal funds rate were in fact negative. Unlike previous literature, this estimate is based on growth rates of real rather than financial market variables. The technique extracts the path of the federal funds rate at the zero lower bound consistent with pre-zero lower bound macroeconomic dynamics. Given the negative interest rate estimate from this second approach, and the relative growth rates of interest rate sensitive industries, the first two chapters suggest that the combination of zero interest rates and unconventional policy succeeded in spurring economic growth in a comparable fashion to previous US recoveries. The third chapter of this dissertation focuses on an international aspect of central banking. Due to a combination of desires for precautionary savings and exchange rate undervaluation, central banks often accumulate reserves. This chapter examines the relationship between foreign reserve accumulation and domestic investment. A central bank's purchases of reserves implies an outflow of domestic savings. If capital markets are imperfect, foreign capital cannot be expected to compensate for this savings outflow. The third chapter thus measures to what extent reserve accumulation is correlated with decreases in domestic investment. In contrast to Reinhart et al. (2016), I find that reserve accumulation does not seem to hamper domestic investment. I conclude with a brief discussion of other possible explanations for the finding and directions for future research. The layout of this dissertation differs slightly from that of the three separate chapters. The first chapter presents the two approaches created for measuring monetary policy at the zero bound. The second chapter expands upon these two approaches, and shows that the findings are highly robust to specification choices, and unlikely to be caused by alternative explanations. Finally, the third chapter presents the portion of this dissertation examining open economy central bank interventions.",NA,"https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=eoh&AN=1607456&site=ehost-live","Skaperdas_2016_essays",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,2520

This paper overcomes this problem by extracting a novel series of monetary shocks using text analysis methods on central bank documents. The resulting text-based variables contain the informational content from changes in the policy rate. Thus, they can be used to extract exogenous changes in monetary policy that are orthogonal to any central bank information.

Two obstacles have prevented this integration in the past: the data gap in the federal funds rate during the zero lower bound (ZLB) period; and the utilization of a single equation rather than a system of equations to model the relationship between the mortgage rate and its determinants. First, we establish that the shadow federal funds rate introduced by Wu and Xia (2015) is a valid proxy for monetary policy during the ZLB period, and we use dimensionality reduction to create proxy variables for important macroeconomic measures. Second, we utilize the generalized impulse response approach to measure in level and first difference the impact of monetary policy and the macroeconomic environment on the long-term mortgage rate. Generally, the effect of macroeconomic variables outweighs that of monetary policy. In addition, omitting macroeconomics variables overestimates the impact of monetary policy on the mortgage rate in level and first difference. For example, shocking the first difference (level) of the federal funds rate by one standard deviation overestimates the impulse responses by 15% (51%) and the variance decompositions by 27% (37%). The current research implies that a noticeable increase in the mortgage rate is associated with an economic environment characterized both by tightening monetary policy and strong economic growth.

Particular attention is paid to the response of the price level, represented by HICP, to various monetary policy innovations. Except a shock in credit multiplier and asset purchase programme (APP), also the effectiveness of a conventional monetary tool, such as main refinancing operation (MRO) interest rate, is inspected. Methods: Use has been made of impulse responses from structural VAR models to analyze a large sample that covers the time horizon of 1999 to 2016. Several econometric tests are performed to provide a profound analysis. The conclusions from baseline models are verified in multiple robustness check models, which are specified under alternative conditions.

The breakout of the global financial crisis highlights the importance of financial shocks. Aiming to maintaining financial stability, Bank for International Settlements (BIS) initialized macro-prudential policies in the early of 2009. China, as one of important countries pioneering the practice of macro-prudential policies, adopted a so called two-pillar regulatory framework of monetary policies and macro-prudential policies to safeguard the macroeconomic and financial stability. However, due to the coincidence of policy targets and the interdependence in transmission mechanisms between monetary policies and macro-prudential policies, the practice of the two-pillar regulatory framework raises some important coordination issues (Beau et al. 2012). The aim of this paper is to discuss theoretically the coordination mechanisms between monetary policies and macro-prudential policies, and then evaluate empirically the effects of the practice of the two-pillar regulatory framework on policy targets, such as economic growth, inflation, and financial stability in China. One of main contributions of this paper is to estimate the causal effects of China's two-pillar regulatory framework from 2007 to 2017 by adopting new macroeconomic policy evaluation methods proposed by Angrist and Kuersteiner (2011) and Angrist et al. (2018). Compared to mainstream methods such as dynamic stochastic general equilibrium (DSGE) models, the macroeconomic policy evaluation methods based on Rubin's causal model alleviate the risk of model misspecification by avoiding to specify how an economy works and how outcome variables are determined. Moreover, the concept of dynamic treatment effect developed in the framework of macroeconomic policy evaluation coincides with the nonlinear impulse function induced by structural models. In other words, the new method can complement the DSGE models by providing parallel estimates insensitive with structural model setup. Another major contribution of this paper is to extend the existing macroeconomic policy evaluation methods by adopting statistical learning methods to estimating policy propensity score functions using macroeconomic big data and proposing a new test statistic for testing the conditional unconfoundedness assumption. It is well known that a major challenge in empirical macroeconomic research is how to capture exogenous policy shocks to identify causal effects. We address this issue in two aspects. First, in order to fully use all information available at the current period, we propose to model policy-making process based on macroeconomic big data and adopt statistical learning methods to solve the high dimensional problem. Moreover, we propose a new test statistic to test the exogeneity of the residuals estimated from the policy propensity scores using macroeconomic big data, which is a conditional unconfoundedness in the context of time series data. The latter actually provides a testable method of evaluating the validity of the use of the macroeconomic policy evaluation method. Finally, our empirical findings can be summarized as follows. First, when macro-prudential policies remaining neutral, monetary policies can effectively manage the aggregate demand and fulfill the output target by adjusting money supply and credit growth, while the transmission channel through interest rates does not work effectively. Second, when monetary policies remaining neutral, macro-prudential policies can maintain financial stability as expected, and at the same time, there are little effects on real economy targets. Last, when monetary policies and macro-prudential policies are jointly implemented, a same direction policy combination can further strengthen the effect on the output target and accelerate the process towards the target. However, the same direction combination has no significant exaggerating impact on financial stability variables. In addition, we find that the same direction combination may cause counteracting effects on some target outcome variables, such as the growth rate of capital adequacy ratio and the risk-weighted asset ratio. We ascribe the counteracting effect to the argument that the same direction policy combination weakens the negative correlations between monetary policies and banks' risk-taking level.",NA,"https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=eoh&AN=1964918&site=ehost-live","Liu_2022_estimating",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,1222

The main advantage of the DFM over the standard structural vector autoregression models (VARs) is that DFMs allow us to avoid “the curse of the dimensionality” and at the same time include the large number of macroeconomic series into the model. The monetary policy shocks here are identified by means of sign restrictions. 57 monthly time series spanning from 2003 to 2017 are used to estimate the SDFM.

The results for the whole period indicate the significant negative impact of the contractionary monetary policy shock on the real and financial sectors of the economy.

The existence of a long lag can mean that monetary policy does the opposite of what it is expected to do, that is, it may stimulate the economy when it is over heated and dampen it when it is recession, in effect making things worse rather than better. The problem of lag is further made difficult by the fact that the lag can be variable meaning that it can be of uncertain length. It is in this respect that this study empirically evaluates the lags in the effect of monetary policy in Nigeria using monetary growth model of aggregate demand.

The results of the study confirmed the notion that monetary policy affects its ultimate target after a lag, which is both long and variable. The existence of a long and variable lag suggests that government monetary policy should not attempt to be actively anti-cyclical but should behave in a manner that is cyclically neutral, also since monetary transmission mechanism plays a major role as far as the timing of monetary policy is concerned and so because of its important role, government should put in place more efficient financial structures to ensure that the transmission mechanisms is hitch free.",NA,"https://www.jstor.org/stable/25825261","Osinubi_2005_lags",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,1235

These factors not only influence inflation within the economy, but also the efficacy of monetary policy in its pursuit of its many goals. The South African economy has thus long been a victim of volatile inflation, low growth and low employment creation, which are all matters that form part of the mandate of monetary policy. This could be because of the indirect measures that have been used by the South African Reserve Bank (SARB) to control both money supply as well as inflation in the economy have become increasingly inefficient over time. Therefore, the primary objective of the study was to analyse the efficiency of monetary policy in South Africa, in terms of reaching its goals as set out by the mandate of the SARB regarding inflation, employment and economic growth and in having done so, investigating the existence of cost-push and structural inflationary factors within the South African economy. This study examined the effects of official interest rate, broad money supply, the exchange rate, government debt and government revenue on CPI inflation, as well as on the efficiency of monetary policy in reaching its objectives. It thus determines the long- and short-run relationships between the aforementioned variables from 2001 to 2017. The study further establishes the causal direction between the variables under study. Therefore, the study employed various econometric models inclusive of the Autoregressive Distributed Lag (ARDL) model, the standard ARDL bounds test to cointegration, the Error Correction Model and Toda-Yamamoto granger noncausality test. Furthermore, the study made use of a quantitative research design and included time series, macro-economic variables such as gross domestic product, employment, the repo rate, broad money supply, the nominal effective exchange rate, government debt, government revenue and consumer price inflation, quarterly from 2001 to 2017. These variables were used in two separate econometric models, one of which had consumer price inflation as its dependent variable, with all other variables as independent. The other combined gross domestic product, employment, consumer price inflation to create the Monetary Policy Success Index or MPSI. By employing the unit root and stationarity tests, the study found that all the variables under study comprised of variables that are stationary at either I(0) or I(1), with none of the variables stationary at I(2). This allowed the ARDL model to be used, which produced results that indicated that the South African economy is consistent with cost-push and structural inflation, which leads to inefficiency in the achievement of the objectives of monetary policy as it takes roughly 5.34 quarters for changes in monetary policy to affect the economy. Both long- and short-run relationships exist between independent and dependent variables. The study further performed the Toda-Yamamoto Granger non-causality test and found that variables such as government revenue and government debt have a short-run impact on consumer price inflation, supporting the existence of structural and cost-push inflation in the South African economy. Equally as important, the results of the residual and stability diagnostic tests, which were performed on both models of the study proved that the study models are normally distributed, none are serially correlated nor heteroscedastic and are both stable.

The effect of an announced increase in the policy rate on inflation expectations is significant and positive. According to the New-Keynesian model, the effect of an exogenous monetary policy shock depends on the assumptions made on the persistence of the shock process in the model. Alternatively, the results may be interpreted as the policy announcement signalling the central bank's private information on the direction of future inflation.

"ref_1256","13",829,"CNKUR3BP","Emiru, Tilahun","Essays in Macroeconomics and International Finance",2020,NA,NA,NA,"thesis","Only about 2.5% of the total external debt of emerging markets was issued in local currencies by the late 1990s (see Eichengreen et al., 1999). The rest was denominated in foreign currencies, predominantly in U.S. dollars. Recent data, however, shows that about a quarter of the total external debt of emerging markets is denominated in their own local currencies (see Arslanalp and Tsuda, 2014). Does this change in the currency of denomination of external debt alter the default incentives of emerging markets? The first two chapters of this dissertation provide an answer to this question. The third chapter of this dissertation examines another question that has gained considerable attention in the past decade--has monetary policy been one of the causes of rising inequality in the United States? A few decades ago, virtually all of the external debt of emerging markets was denominated in foreign currencies. Located at the heart of many emerging-market crises in the 1990s, this skewness in the currency of denomination has been termed 'the original sin', Eichengreen et al. (1999). Nowadays, many emerging markets are able to issue external debt in their own currency. How does this change in the currency of denomination alter default incentives? I show, empirically and theoretically, that an increase in local currency debt decreases the likelihood of default. The first chapter begins by showing that there is a statistically significant positive correlation between higher local currency external debt and better credit ratings, a proxy for the probability of default, and hence lower likelihood of default. This relationship between local currency debt and credit ratings could, however, suffer from endogeneity issues. One potential source of endogeneity is reverse causation--do countries issue more local currency debt because they have a lower likelihood of default or do they have a lower likelihood of default because they issue more debt in the local currency? Hence, estimating the causal effect of local currency debt on default probabilities requires a more solid identification strategy. To study the causal effect of local currency debt on the likelihood of default, I estimate a trivariate Structural Vector Autoregression (SVAR) model. Two rather mild assumptions are needed to identify the structural shocks: that the U.S. interest rate does not respond to the interest rate as well as the local currency external debt of emerging markets, and that the local currency external debt of emerging markets does not contemporaneously respond to the U.S. interest rate. Having imposed these identifying assumptions, I find that sovereign spreads shrink by about 40 to 60 basis points in response to a positive, one standard deviation shock to the local currency share of external debt indicating that the likelihood of default falls. The second chapter studies the relationship between local currency external debt and default likelihoods theoretically. I build a model of sovereign default where there are two currencies of denomination--the home currency and the foreign currency. A bond denominated in the foreign currency is an I.O.U to repay one unit of the foreign currency the next period whereas a bond denominated in local currency pays one unit of the home currency the next period. A benevolent government issues these bonds in the international capital market to smooth the consumption of a representative household that faces shocks to the endowment of traded goods. Moreover, the government prints money which it can use to repay local currency denominated external debt. Default occurs in response to a sufficiently large negative endowment shock, and when it does, the government defaults on all of its debt (i.e., both denominations). There are two costs of default--exclusion from international markets and output costs. Exclusion from international markets lasts for a random number of periods, and upon re-entry, the sovereign's entire stock of debt is erased off the books. I then solve the model and simulate two model economies that are otherwise identical except for the difference in the size of their local currency external debt. One economy has 90% of its external debt in the local currency while the other economy has only 10% of its external debt in the local currency. The default rates, as well as other business cycle statistics of the simulated models, are then compared. The results point to one major conclusion--an economy's stock local currency external debt is an important determinant of whether it will experience a debt crisis. In the model, an increase in the share of local currency debt from 10% to 90% leads to a decrease in the default rate from 4.6% to 0.3%. An important mechanism is behind this result. When there is sizable local currency debt, the government resorts to costly deficit monetization in response to negative output shocks before it exercises the option to default. However, given that inflation engenders welfare cost, outright default will still occur even when most of the external debt is denominated in the local currency. Thus, while the presence of local currency leads to lower default probabilities, it does not imply that outright default completely disappears. In addition to its prediction about default probabilities, the quantitative model is able to replicate some stylized facts about emerging market business cycles. In particular, interest rates and net exports are counter-cyclical, interest rates and net exports are positively correlated, and the standard deviation of consumption is higher than the standard deviation of income, which are all standard business cycle features of emerging markets. The third chapter of this dissertation empirically studies the effect, or the lack thereof, of monetary policy on inequality. The increase in inequality in the United States, while it is part of a trend that began decades ago, has attracted a renewed interest recently. With this attention has come the assertion that monetary policy has been one of the prime drivers of inequality in income and wealth. There are various channels through which monetary policy potentially affects inequality in income and consumption, and some of these channels conceivably work in opposite directions making a comprehensive empirical study on the topic even more important. This chapter provides one such study. The data come from Consumer Expenditure Survey (CEX) and other secondary data sources and run from the first quarter of 1984 to the last quarter of 2014. I construct three measures of income and consumption inequality--Gini coefficient, cross-sectional standard deviation, and percentile ratios--and use them in Vector Autoregression (VAR), Jorda's local projections, and proxy VAR models. Monetary policy in this study covers both conventional and unconventional types. To study the effects of these two policies, I use fed funds rate and rates on two-year treasury notes, respectively. In the local projections and proxy VAR exercises, I also use exogenous monetary policy shocks, proposed by Romer and Romer (2004) and Gertler and Karadi (2015). Estimation of the three models results in qualitatively similar results. First, The impulse responses and the associated confidence bands from the three analyses indicate that while there are some borderline significant effects on income and earnings, the effect of monetary policy, both conventional and unconventional, on income and consumption inequality is generally very weak, if there is any. Second, the results from local projections estimation indicate that monetary policy tends to increase income inequality in the upper half of the distribution and not in the bottom half of the distribution. However, neither in the top nor in the bottom of the consumption distribution does monetary policy have any significant effect. While I believe that this study will contribute to the growing literature on monetary policy and inequality by empirically documenting the relationship between monetary policy and inequality, at least one caveat is in order. Recent studies have shown that data from the CEX suffer from measurement errors. Thus, the inequality measures based on the CEX data are to be taken with caution. Moreover, earlier theoretical work on the topic focused on one particular link between monetary policy and inequality. A more general theoretical framework would be a valuable addition to the literature.",NA,"https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=eoh&AN=1868644&site=ehost-live","Emiru_2020_essays",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,1250

Area-specific shocks are thus more important in EMU than country-specific shocks used to be in the previous states, e.g. in Germany. It is thus not surprising that the models built by the staff of the European Central Bank (ECB) to study optimal monetary policy in the Euro area (for instance Smets and Wouters, 2004a, 2004b) typically assume that this works essentially as a closed economy, hit by domestic shocks--the same assumption made in standard models of U.S. monetary policy (see e.g. Christiano et al., 1999 ), where all shocks are domestic with the only possible exception of energy price shocks. Two-country models exist at the ECB (e.g. de Walque, Smets, Wouters, 2005) but they overlook asset price fluctuations and their international comovements. This paper studies monetary policy in the Euro area looking at the variable most directly related to current and expected monetary policy, the yield on long term government bonds. We explore how the behaviour of European long-term rates has been affected by EMU and whether the response of long-term rates to monetary policy has got any closer to that consistent with a closed economy. We find that the level of long-term rates in Europe is almost entirely explained by U.S. shocks and by the systematic response of U.S. and European variables (inflation, short term rates and the output gap) to these shocks. Our results suggest in particular that U.S. variables are more important than local variables in the policy rule followed by European monetary authorities: this was true for the Bundesbank before EMU and has remained true for the ECB, at least so far. Using closed economy models to analyze monetary policy in the Euro is thus inconsistent with the empirical evidence on the determinants of Euro area long-term rates. It is also inconsistent with the way the Governing Council of the ECB appears to make actual policy decisions. We also find that Euro area long rates respond more to financial shocks, in particular shocks to term premia, than they do to monetary policy ""shocks""--i.e. instances when the ECB deviates from its rule. This finding point to the importance of incorporating into the analysis of Euro area monetary policy of the effects of fluctuations in international asset prices.",NA,"https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=eoh&AN=0970901&site=ehost-live","Favero_2008_should",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,1263

Furthermore, in the short–run the level of production is more important in controlling inflation, but it is monetary policy variables that matter in the long–run. Therefore, there is the need to differentiate between short and long run monetary policy targets. It was recommended that, policy makers should concentrate on short-run output expansion policies and put measures in place to sustain growth in the long-run to control inflation.

After that the GDP price deflator declines. Our major findings regarding the borrowing activities of different sectors can be summarized as follows. First, following a contractionary shock to monetary policy, net funds raised by the business sector increases for roughly a year. Thereafter, as the recession induced by the policy shock gains momentum, net funds raised by the business sector begins to fall. This pattern is not captured by existing monetary business cycle models.

In the modeling strategy, a priori sign restrictions play an important role. They are imposed not on impulse response functions but directly on the reduced form single or multi-step equations, unlike in recent work by Uhlig and Canova. This is possible because in this context, the reduced form inherits important structural sign properties; basically, that autonomous expenditure has positive effects on near future GDP. We consider an economically large class of variables, including effects from interest rates, the credit channel and asset prices, the real exchange rate, yield spreads, inflation and interest rate volatility, oil prices (including asymmetries), structural breaks in fiscal and monetary policy, the recent behaviour of consumption, investment and profitability, and the evolutionary effect of globalization on the balance of payments constraint. We follow a general to specific methodology, including the help of PCGETS (Hendry and Krolzig, 2001) to reduce general models to more parsimonious ones. Relative to conventional VARs, our models imply longer lag structures than ever considered in VARs, as well as non-linearities, and so could never have been found with conventional VAR restrictions. Our results thus contradict the suggestion of Sims (1980) that VARs can resolve the problem of 'incredible restrictions' embodied in large macro econometric models. Our exercise of learning from the data through general to specific modeling is likely, in many cases, also to contradict the lag structures of such models.

However, it is hard to measure such effects owing to the difficulty in isolating credit supply shocks. This paper employs survey data to identify the impact of credit supply shocks in Australia over the past three decades, using a structural vector autoregression approach. We estimate that a one standard deviation shock to the balance of firms reporting difficulty obtaining finance (a 'credit supply shock') reduces Australian GDP by almost 1/3 per cent after one year and gross national expenditure by nearly 1/2 per cent. The effect on business credit is larger and more persistent, with credit declining by nearly 1 per cent relative to its baseline after two and a half years. During the global financial crisis, the cumulative impact of credit supply shocks is estimated to have contributed to a reduction in GDP of 1 per cent (in mid 2009). While credit supply shocks had a notable effect on GDP during the global financial crisis, this credit event appears to have been shorter and sharper than that experienced during the period of financial instability in the early 1990s. Consistent with a 'credit channel' of monetary policy transmission, an unexpected tightening of monetary policy results in a significant increase in the balance of firms reporting difficulty obtaining finance. We also find effects consistent with a financial accelerator mechanism, whereby an improvement in balance sheets results in easier credit conditions and higher GDP and business credit. Altogether, these results suggest that credit market developments have been an integral aspect of the business cycle in Australia since financial deregulation in the 1980s.",NA,"https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=eoh&AN=1311987&site=ehost-live","Jacobs_2012_the",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,1286

While the response of output growth rate to shocks from positive monetary policy was significant but negative, its response to shocks from negative monetary policy was positive and significant. It was equally noted in our analysis that positive monetary policy shocks to domestic interest reduces the exchange and output growth rate both at aggregate and sectoral levels. However, the effects of negative monetary policy were wider than that of positive effects. This shows that negative monetary policy would be more efficacious when output is desired to be increased.

The augmented Dickey–Fuller test and the Phillips–Perron test were used for the stationarity test. Further, the F-bounds test was run to justify the long-run relationship between monetary policy and economic growth. Thereafter, long-run coefficients were revealed from the auto-regressive distributed lag (ARDL) model and short-run coefficients from the error correction model. Furthermore, the vector error correction model (VECM) Granger causality approach was employed to demonstrate the causality of studied variables. Lastly, different diagnostics tests ensured the robustness of the models. Findings F-bounds test outcomes suggest that monetary policy has a long-run relationship with economic growth in both countries. Long-run coefficients revealed that money supply has a positive long-run impact on economic growth in both countries. Unlike the UK, the exchange rate exhibits an adverse effect on the economic growth of Bangladesh. The bank rate seems to promote economic growth for the UK. Findings also depict that increase in lending interest rates hurts the economic growth for both countries. Besides, the short-run coefficients portray random effects at different lags in both cases.

Using household- and firm-level datasets, I study these outcomes in the context of exploring the effects of monetary policy shocks. Most macroeconomic models use a representative agent framework to study the effects of monetary policy. In such models all consumers are assumed to be similar, therefore, it is only required to know the size of the monetary policy shock and its average impact to estimate the overall effect. But recent literature has emphasized the importance of agent heterogeneity for explaining observed aggregate dynamics and optimal policy design. Here, it matters which consumers get the extra income as people react differently to the shock. In a model with a realistically calibrated household balance sheet, monetary policy has redistribution effects because different agents have differential exposure to the interest rate and inflation risk born in their portfolios. For example, short-term or nominal borrowers will win from a sudden decrease in the interest rate and a sudden increase in inflation, while short-term lenders or nominal lenders will lose. In the first chapter of the dissertation, co authored with Anastasia Burya, we study the effect of heterogeneity in consumers' portfolios on the unemployment response to monetary policy. We develop a search efforts model with heterogeneous agents and then decompose the effect of the monetary policy shock on aggregate unemployment. The direction and the magnitude of the wealth effect will determine whether people search for jobs more actively after a monetary contraction. For example, if unemployed consumers are indebted, they experience a negative wealth effect after a contraction, search for jobs more actively and increase their probability of finding a job, therefore, reducing unemployment. In this framework, the sign of the overall effect of monetary policy on unemployment will depend on whether unemployed consumers are indebted and the magnitude of their debt. We test the prediction of the model in both micro and aggregate data. To test the prediction of the model in the micro data using the PSID panel dataset, we estimate the coefficient of the interaction term between various mortgage measures and Romer and Romer monetary policy shocks while looking at five main transition probabilities that indicate a higher increase in search efforts for indebted people after a monetary contraction: dynamic transition probability of moving from non employment to employment, moving from non participation in the labor force to employment, remaining a non participant in the labor force, remaining unemployed and taking up an extra job. In the aggregate data, we use a similar estimation approach with debt to income ratio. We also subject this to a variety of checks using age and Saiz instruments for increased robustness. In the second chapter of the dissertation, co-authored with Anastasia Burya and Martsella Davitaya, we show that inflation expectations are anchored. If inflation expectations are anchored, then their sensitivity to monetary policy should be smaller than if they are de-anchored. When the Fed pursues inflation targeting, the market expectations of Fed's reaction should affect the response to current monetary policy shocks. We use daily bond yield data to show that the sensitivity of inflation expectations to monetary policy is lower if the Fed is more responsive to inflation during the previous CPI release. Intuitively, the Fed announcement leading to a rate change that is higher than expected from the CPI release indicates that the markets expect the Fed to react more aggressively in the future. Therefore, markets do not adjust inflation expectations as much (leading to anchored inflation expectations). The empirical strategy consists of two steps. First, we measure market expectations about the Fed's reaction to inflation by regressing the changes of different interest rates around the CPI release dates on the surprise change in CPI. Second, we estimate the sensitivity of inflation expectations' response to monetary policy based on the expectations about the Fed's reaction to inflation. Product markets are characterized by the significant heterogeneity of demand elasticity between large and small firms. In many cases, the ability of larger firms to dictate prices is such that they are able to charge higher markups. In the third chapter, co-authored with Anastasia Burya, we develop a simple model of firms with heterogeneous market power. We connect the recent trend of increasing market power to the flattening of the Phillips Curve through the decreasing aggregate pass-through. We explore the sufficient statistic arising from this model and then proceed to estimate it in the data. Here, we consider heterogeneity in demand elasticity and superelasticity. In the recent literature as well, papers such as Baqaee, Farhi and Sangani (2021) and Wang and Werning (2020) have brought to attention that certain parameters of demand are important for various macroeconomic dynamics such as the flattening of the Phillips Curve. It was also shown that the degree of these effects depends on the demand parameters, such as elasticity and superelasticity. We estimate these parameters in a novel format using an empirical procedure called Granular IV, which was first described in Gabaix and Koijen (2020) and makes use of the fact that in reality, unlike baseline macroeconomic models, some firms are big enough to impact the aggregates. For this estimation, we use firm-level price data from AC Nielsen Retail Scanner database. Employing the novel empirical approach we estimate these relevant demand parameters. We estimate a demand elasticity of 3.23, in line with the literature. Our estimate for super elasticity is 3.74 which is in line with Marshall's second law of demand and for constant superelasticity parametrisation would signify the curvature of the demand curve between that of CES and linear demand.",NA,"https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=eoh&AN=2009335&site=ehost-live","Mishra_2022_essays",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,1312

We find that monetary policy shocks during the implementation period of the UMP had statistically significant expansionary effects on the economy. We also find that an unexpected 100 basis point cut in shadow rates during the UMP yielded larger expansionary effects on key economic variables than it did during the conventional monetary policy (CMP), because of the following three reasons: (i) A cut in the shadow rates resulted in a larger reduction in the real interest rate, and affected a wider range of borrowing rates during the UMP; (ii) The effectiveness of monetary policy shocks was dampened when the financial system was significantly impaired, particularly during the CMP; (iii) Other things being equal, the effectiveness has been so far little affected by the level of policy rate. Our results show that UMP has been effective, but that the nature of monetary transmission is subject to change depending on financial conditions or other economic circumstances, and therefore monetary policy needs to be carefully implemented.

The study further examines the extent to which changes in monetary policy affect industrial output in expansions relative to contractions. Employing the Peersman and Smets (2001) Markov-Switching Model (MSM) and monthly data from 1994.01–2013.12, the study reveals that the five BRICS countries have similar business cycles. The results further demonstrate that the BRICS countries’ business cycles are characterized by two distinct growth rate phases: a contractionary regime and an expansionary regime. It can also be observed that the area-wide monetary policy has significantly large effects on industrial output in recessions as well as in booms. It has also been established that there is a high probability of moving from state one (recession) to state two (expansion) and that on average, the probabilities of staying in state 2 (expansion) are high for each of the five countries. It is, therefore, recommended that the BRICS countries should sustain uniform policy consistency (monetary policy), especially as they formulate and implement economic policies to stimulate industrial output.","10.1515/foli-2017-0017","https://sciendo.com/article/10.1515/foli-2017-0017","Kutu_2017_monetary",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,1317

This paper applied the formula for user cost price of money and the recently developed credit-card-augmented Divisia monetary aggregates formula to construct monetary service indexes for Singapore. We produced state-of-the-art monetary service indexes from January 1991 to March 2021. We found that Divisia measures behave differently than simple sum measures in the period before the year 2000, when interest rates were high. Credit-card-augmented Divisia monetary services move closely with the conventional Divisia monetary aggregates, since the volume of credit card transactions in Singapore is relatively small compared with other monetary assets. The second chapter uses the constructed Divisia indexes and other data to examine different instruments of monetary policy and their relevance in predicting real economic activity in Singapore. I apply the Hamilton based filter to extract the cyclical component of each time series and compute the cyclical correlation of different targets of monetary policy including interest rate, money supply and exchange rate with output and inflation. I find that while exchange rate and all money measures show a weakly contemporaneous correlation with output and inflation, interest rate is not contemporaneously correlated to either output or inflation. Among different money measures, Divisia always shows a stronger correlation with both output and inflation than simple sum. Credit-card-augmented Divisia is the most informative indicator to predict output and price. To confirm the above statistical findings in a more rigorous framework, the last chapter in my dissertation revisits the issue of money measurement in the context of a small open economy using a recently developed micro founded DSGE model. I extend the New Keynesian model for a small open economy from the work of Faia and Monacelli in a similar manner to Belongia and Ireland by introducing private financial institutions, which create deposits as an imperfect substitute for government-issued currency. The banking sector allows the accommodation of multiple monetary assets like currency and interest-bearing-deposits. The central bank conducts its monetary policy via a simple interest rate rule. I explore the responses of different money measures including simple sum, monetary base, and Divisia quantity aggregate with respect to domestic and foreign shocks and compare these responses with those from a theoretical monetary aggregator. I find that Divisia tracks the movement of money most closely to the theoretical measure, followed by monetary base, while simple sum often does not match the correct trend. I analyze the impact of openness, which has an inverse relation with home-bias in consumption, on the volatility of macroeconomic variables. I find that as the small economy becomes more open, domestic inflation and nominal interest rate become more volatile while terms of trade and exchange rate become more stable. Among the different money measures, monetary base and Divisia follow the theoretical monetary aggregate to become less volatile as consumption becomes less home-biased, while simple sum, becomes more volatile.",NA,"https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=eoh&AN=2010110&site=ehost-live","Nguyen_2022_divisia",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,1319

To correctly identify innovations in changes in legal reserve requirements, we develop a narrative approach--based on contemporaneous reports from the IMF and Central Banks in the spirit of Romer and Romer (2010)--that classifies each change into endogenous or exogenous to the business cycle. We show that this distinction is critical in understanding the macroeconomic effects of reserve requirements. In particular, we show that output falls in response to exogenous increases in legal reserve requirements but would seem not to be affected (or could even increase!) when using all changes and relying on traditional time-identifying strategies. This bias reflects the practical relevance of the misidentification of endogenous countercyclical changes in reserve requirements. We also push the empirical frontier along two important dimensions. First, in measuring legal reserve requirements, we take into account both the different types of legal reserve requirements in terms of maturity and currency of denomination as well as the structure of deposits.

The success of the Kim and Roubini model across these economies makes it a natural starting point to analyse monetary policy in Australia. Consistent with Kim and Roubini, we find no evidence of the price or exchange rate puzzles identified in the literature. We demonstrate that, in the Australian context, modelling the interdependence between the domestic interest rate, the foreign interest rate and the nominal exchange rate is critical to resolving these puzzles. Further, we demonstrate that the Kim and Roubini model can be further usefully refined when applied to the Australian data. We use the model to perform various monetary policy experiments and the results of these experiments accord well with both the existing SVAR literature and previous empirical work for Australia. We find that monetary policy shocks have a delayed and gradual effect on the price level and a small temporary effect on output. We also use the model to examine the effects of shocks to the Australian economy and the role of monetary policy in response to these shocks.

The data collected were analyzed using descriptive statistics such as Mean, Standard Deviation and Skewness and the relationship between the variables of the model was tested using Autoregressive Distributed Lag Model (ARDL) regression analysis after the data was found to be stationary and integrated of different orders. The result of the ARDL regression analysis shows that monetary policy rate has positive but insignificant relationship (p>0.05) with economic growth, whereas liquidity ratio has a negative relationship with economic growth. The negative relationship between liquidity ratio and economic growth is significant at 5% (p<0.05) level of significance. Thus, this leads to the acceptance of the null hypothesis for hypothesis one and two as the p-values of the f-statistic are greater than 0.05 (insignificant at 5% level of significance). This study concludes that monetary policy does not affect economic growth in Nigeria significantly. It is thus left for further study on fiscal policy or the combination of the two to see the effect on economic growth. It was recommended that the Central Bank of Nigeria should further develop the financial sector through making more funds available to the private sector by reducing monetary policy rate which affects interest rate ceiling on loans to the private sector. And that there should be consistency in policy objectives of the CBN.

Over longer horizons, shocks to output, inflation and commodity prices play a greater role. The response of credit to changes in monetary policy is found to be relatively slow, similar to that of inflation and slower than that of output. The model suggests that an unexpected 25 basis point increase in the interest rate results in the level of credit being almost half of a percentage point lower than it otherwise would have been after a bit over one year, and almost 1 per cent lower after four years. Estimates from the model indicate that in responding to the macroeconomic consequences of a credit shock, monetary policy appears to stabilise the economy effectively. As a result of monetary policy's response, output and the exchange rate are barely affected by a credit shock.

The evolution of bank lending after a monetary contraction is then analysed. For most countries, it is shown that bank loans decline more than money in the medium run.

I employ a vector autoregression (VAR) identified with sign and zero restrictions to simulate a monetary policy shock implemented by the Federal Reserve consistent with the economic theory suggesting unconventional monetary policy measures. I find that banks respond to expansionary monetary policy shocks by taking additional risk through lowering lending standards, however banks still experience a compression in lending margins, indicating little success in their efforts to stabilize reductions in profits. I also include a number of counterfactual interest rates to allow Fed policy rates to reflect negative interest rate policies to compare monetary policy shocks across the conventional and unconventional monetary policy regimes in a consistent manner. I find that banks take less risk in the unconventional monetary policy regime relative to the conventional regime, however they experience a larger reduction in lending margins relative to the pre-Financial Crisis period. Use of a forecast error variance decomposition indicates the risk channel played a larger role in the post-Financial Crisis period, carrying implications for Fed policy in considering this particular transmission mechanism in unconventional monetary policy measures. The second chapter of this dissertation addresses the foreign central bank responses of 12 advanced economies and 12 emerging market economies to United States unconventional monetary policy shocks identified by a combination of sign and zero restrictions in a global vector autoregression (GVAR) framework. I find foreign central banks follow in kind with United States unconventional monetary policy measures, such as Quantitative Easing, in order to offset undesirable spillover effects. My results also indicate that United States Quantitative Easing plays a more substantial role in determining monetary easing conditions in emerging markets than in advanced economies. Additionally, I find foreign central banks with inflation targeting or floating exchange rate policies tend to follow a United States Quantitative Easing shock with more stable monetary policy responses, with larger increases in output than non-inflation targeting or managed exchange rate regimes.

By contrast, most of the numerous recent zero interest-rate bound papers have ignored the use of fiscal stimulus, preferring to examine whether monetary policy alone can revive the economy despite the zero bound. We obtain our estimates by adapting and simulating a macro-econometric model that has been recently econometrically estimated, updated, and statistically tested using U.S. times series data. By contrast, most of the recent zero bound papers do not use an econometrically-estimated model. If the U.S. economy were hit with a large negative demand shock that drives the unemployment rate up to 7.9%, we estimate that even aggressive monetary policy that drives long-term interest rates to near zero would reduce the unemployment rate only to 6.7%. Full recovery would be achieved, however, if the aggressive monetary policy were complemented by sufficient fiscal stimulus in the form of cash transfers or income tax cuts to households. We estimate that a quarterly transfer to households that peaks at 2.7% of quarterly GDP and phases out gradually as it is repeated over seven quarters (so that the cumulative transfer is roughly 12% of quarterly GDP) would reduce the unemployment rate in such a recession by nearly an additional percentage pointC from 6.7% to 5.9%.",NA,"https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=eoh&AN=0844716&site=ehost-live","Lewis_2005_can",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,1358

Indeed, three main hypothesis on this issue have been put forward: (i) regions with high share of manufacturing, (ii) regions that include higher proportion of small-scale firms and banks, (iii) regions which are more open to trade are likely to respond more strongly to changes in monetary policy. Although these hypotheses have been thoroughly and heatedly discussed by a strand of scholars, far little attention has been paid to the role of geographical factors and spatial spillovers.

Economic growth was proxied by real gross domestic product growth rate. The data were sourced from the publications of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), Statista.com, and the World Bank. The estimation technique was the ordinary least squares (OLS)-based auto-regressive distributed-lag (ARDL) method with the aid of EViews software. The estimated model was evaluated using some diagnostic tests (serial correlation test, normality test, and stability test). The empirical results showed that only interest rate had a positive (0.42) and significant (10%) impact on economic growth in Nigeria in the short run. In the long run, previous gross domestic product and broad money supply had significant impacts on economic growth in Nigeria. The previous gross domestic product had a negative (-0.72) and significant (10%) impact while broad money supply had a negative (-0.000005) and significant (5%) impact on economic growth in Nigeria. In order to effectively use monetary policy instruments in achieving sustainable economic growth, it was recommended that the monetary authority should develop and implement an expansionary monetary policy capable of creating rapid growth of money supply which would lead to a decrease in interest rate which in turn would lead to increase in aggregate investment. These would lead to an increase in economic growth, if properly implemented.","10.6007/IJARBSS/v11-i5/11304","https://hrmars.com/journals/papers/IJARBSS/v11-i5/11304","Shaibu_2021_monetary",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,1365

The literature on inflation dynamics and monetary policy focuses on developed economies, with little attention devoted to the African economies, which is potentially explained by the fact that in the past monetary policy played second fiddle because of fiscal policy dominance following episodes of high inflation and stabilisation policies that occurred in the 1980’s. This thesis fills an important gap in assessing African’s monetary policy. The thesis predominantly uses the Vector-Autoregression (VAR) framework to examine the monetary policy frameworks of the African economies. The thesis finds that an interest rate shock on average explain a more significant proportion of the variance in the output gap and inflation than the exchange rate, in terms of analysing the decomposition of shocks to the economy. This shows a shift in the monetary policy focus away from exchange rate management to interest rate targeting as the African economies have become more market oriented. The monetary policy reveal strong asymmetric responses with respect to the macroeconomic variables when inflation exceeds its threshold value. The analysis suggests that monetary policy in the African economies is regime-dependent, propagated through the inflation thresholds, such that the authorities strongly implement policy changes when inflation goes beyond a certain threshold. The thesis reveals that by taking into account the prior belief of the monetary authorities, it helps produce better estimates of the performance of the monetary policy transmission mechanism, as it combines prior information with the sampling information which is contained in the data. The overall novelty of the thesis is that some African economies are adopting inflation targeting policies instead of exchange rate management. It is imperative that the subsequent inflation targeting frameworks will achieve monetary policy objectives for the African economies and the use of interest rate management should be continued.",NA,NA,"Moleka_NA_inﬂation",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,1366

To measure the pure surprising factor of the change in fed funds rate, I extract the surprising factor after eliminating the fed funds futures rate from the total change in the fed funds rate. The interest rate policy’s significance is shown in the crouching ordinary least squares model, consisting of decomposed surprises, percentage change in price levels, and unemployment in two directions, increase and decrease. The short-run results show that when a monetary authority surprises a market by increasing the fed funds rate higher than expected (a contractional policy), the unemployment rate increases.",NA,"https://www.dbpia.co.kr/Journal/articleDetail?nodeId=NODE08827949","유재인_2014_hidden",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,1381

Monetary policy is modeled in the context of the Bernanke-Mihov (1998) structural VAR (SVAR) extended to allow explicitly for the Fed's forward looking behavior. This is achieved by including its real-time forecasts on inflation and unemployment (the ""Greenbook"" forecasts). Stability tests that exploit the SVAR identifying restriction indicate significant time variation. Since a central goal is to characterize the economic relevance of the identified changes, the paper shows how the estimation of a flexible time varying parameter model can be implemented in a SVAR using the median-unbiased estimation procedure developed by Stock and Watson (1998). The results suggest an important shift towards a greater response to inflation relative to unemployment, which might have been accompanied by an increase in its targeted level. While the bulk of these changes were brought about under Volcker, they fail to explain the high interest rates and the recession of the early 80's. Together with the results obtained for the period around the 1990 recession, changes in monetary policy, defined in the strict context of the identified policy rule, do not appear to be important in the explanation of business cycle fluctuations.","10.2139/ssrn.217430","https://papers.ssrn.com/abstract=217430","Boivin_1999_the",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,1383

Inflation rate was measured by conditional variance generated by fitting an empirical Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Hetroskedasticity (GARCH) model to seasonally adjust annual consumer price inflation for the period 1960-2015. The inflation rate measure, together with macroeconomic control variables, was used to estimate economic growth models for two periods corresponding to two monetary policy regimes and a third period covering the full sample. The first period corresponds to the pre-inflation targeting regime covering 1960-2002. During this period, Ghana had adopted various monetary policy frameworks including exchange-rate targeting, discretionary monetary policy, monetary-aggregate targeting and an eclectic approach. This period was largely characterized by high inflation rate. The inflation rate in turn had significant negative impact on economic growth during this period. Nonetheless, inflation rate did not have any statistically significant impact on real economic growth during the inflation targeting monetary policy period, i.e. 2003-2015. The empirical results for the combined growth model were consistent with the findings for the two periods. The implication of this is that by adopting the inflation targeting monetary policy framework since 2003, Ghana has to some extent succeeded in achieving low and stable general price level thereby creating a conducive environment for economic growth.

To determine the channels by which monetary policy shocks affect the exchange rate, I investigate the effects on various components of capital flows. The main empirical findings are as follows. First, a contractionary monetary policy shock, which increases the interest rate, appreciates the Korean won significantly in the short run as predicted by most theories. Second, contractionary monetary policy shocks increase capital inflows into the bond market consistent with the prediction of the uncovered interest parity condition. This seems to be the main channel by which contractionary monetary shocks appreciate the won.

Now that the common currency is a reality, questions concerning the practical conduct of monetary policy in the European Monetary Union (EMU) are moving to the forefront of the policy debate. Among these, one of the most critical is how the new monetary union will cope with the large heterogeneity of its member economies. Given the large differences in economic and financial structures among the EMU member states, monetary policy is likely to affect different member economies in different ways.  Regional Aspects of Monetary Policy in Europe collects the proceedings of an international conference held at the Center for European Integration Studies of the University of Bonn, dedicated to this issue. The contributions to this conference fall into two parts. The first part consists of empirical and theoretical studies of the regional effects of monetary policy in heterogeneous monetary unions. The second part consists of papers analyzing the political economy of monetary policy in a monetary union of heterogeneous regions or member states.  The papers all support the conclusion that regional differences in the responses to a common monetary policy will make European monetary policy especially difficult in the years to come. Such differences arise from a variety of sources, and they cannot be expected to be mere teething troubles that will disappear after a while. Even if they were ignored in the run-up to the EMU, Europe's central bankers and economic policy makers will have to learn how to cope with such differences in the future.",NA,NA,"Hagen_2013_regional",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,1405

Our new procedure identifies economic shocks as exogenous shifts in a function; hence, we call them “functional shocks.” We show how to identify such shocks and how to trace their effects in the economy via VARs using “VARs with functional shocks” and “functional local projections.” Using our new procedure, we address the crucial question of studying the effects of monetary policy by identifying monetary policy shocks as shifts in the whole term structure of government bond yields in a narrow window of time around monetary policy announcements. Our approach sheds new light on the effects of monetary policy shocks, both in conventional and unconventional periods, and shows that traditional identification procedures may miss important effects. Our new procedure has the advantage of identifying monetary policy shocks during both conventional and unconventional monetary policy periods in a unified manner and can be applied more generally to other economic shocks.","10.3982/QE1225","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.3982/QE1225","Inoue_2021_a",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,1406

The applications are on finance and macroeconomics. Each chapter utilizes time series techniques to analyze dynamic characteristics of data. The first chapter is on composite likelihood (CL) estimation, which has gained a lot of attention in the statistics field but is a relatively new technique to the economics literature. I study its asymptotic properties in a complex dynamic nonlinear model and use it to analyze corporate bond ratings. The second chapter explores the importance of global food price fluctuations. In particular, I measure the effects of global food shocks on domestic macroeconomic variables for a large number of countries. The third chapter proposes a method to interpret latent factors in a data-rich environment. In the application, I find five meaningful factor driving the US economy. Chapter 1, persistent discrete data are modeled by Autoregressive Probit model and estimated by CL estimation. Autocorrelation in the latent variable results in an intractable likelihood function containing high dimensional integrals. CL approach offers a fast and reliable estimation compared to computationally demanding simulation methods. I provide consistency and asymptotic normality results of the CL estimator and use it to study the credit ratings. The ratings are modeled as imperfect measures of the latent and autocorrelated creditworthiness of firms explained by the balance sheet ratios and business cycle variables. The empirical results show evidence for rating assignment according to Through-the-cycle methodology, that is, the ratings do not respond to the short-term fluctuations in the financial situation of the firms. Moreover, I show that the ratings become more volatile over time, in particular after the crisis, as a reaction to the regulations and critics on credit rating agencies. Chapter 2, which is a joint work with Bilge Erten, explores the sources and effects of global shocks that drive global food prices. We examine this question using a sign-restricted SVAR model and rich data on domestic output and its components for 82 countries from 1980 to 2011. After identifying the relevant demand and supply shocks that explain fluctuations in real food prices, we quantify their dynamic effects on net food-importing and food-exporting economies. We find that global food shocks have contractionary effects on the domestic output of net food importers, and they are transmitted through deteriorating trade balances and declining household consumption. We document expansionary and shorter-lived effects for net food exporters. By contrast, positive global demand shocks that also increase real food prices stimulate the domestic output of both groups of countries. Our results indicate that identifying the source of a shock that affects global food prices is crucial to evaluate its domestic effects. The adverse effects of global food shocks on household consumption are larger for net food importers with relatively high shares of food expenditures in household budgets and those with relatively high food trade deficits as a share of total food trade. Finally, we find that global food and energy shocks jointly explain 8 to 14 percent of the variation in domestic output. Chapter 3, which is a joint work with Sinem Hacioglu, exploits a data rich environment to propose a method to interpret factors which are otherwise difficult to assign economic meaning to by utilizing a threshold factor-augmented vector autoregression (FAVAR) model. We observe the frequency of the factor loadings being induced to zero when they fall below the estimated threshold to infer the economic relevance that the factors carry. The results indicate that we can link the factors to particular economic activities, such as real activity, unemployment, without any prior specification on the data set. By exploiting the flexibility of FAVAR models in structural analysis, we examine impulse response functions of the factors and individual variables to a monetary policy shock. The results suggest that the proposed method provides a useful framework for the interpretation of factors and associated shock transmission.",NA,"https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=eoh&AN=1677425&site=ehost-live","Tuzcuoglu_2017_three",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,1407

We show that these empirical results are also consistent with a “Fed response to news” channel, in which incoming, publicly available economic news causes both the Fed to change monetary policy and the private sector to revise its forecasts. We provide substantial new evidence that distinguishes between these two channels and strongly favors the latter; for example, (i) regressions that include the previously omitted public economic news, (ii) a new survey that we conduct of Blue Chip forecasters, and (iii) high-frequency financial market responses to FOMC announcements all indicate that the Fed and private sector are simply responding to the same public news, and that there is little if any role for a “Fed information effect”.",NA,"https://papers.ssrn.com/abstract=3580571","Bauer_2020_an",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,1420

Basically, the study empirically seeks to provide answers to four major questions, namely: (i)  monetary policy dynamics on growth in SSACs? (iii) What are the dynamic interactions between monetary policy variables and growth and (iv) To what extent do the identified external factors of oil and commodity price volatilities influence monetary policy dynamics in SSACs? Due to data collection constraints, 36 countries within the four major economic blocs of EAC, CEMAC, ECOWAS and SADC were selected covering a period from 1980-2015 thereby making the residuals both time series and cross sectional in nature. The overall variables of interest as identified in the literature are gross domestic product growth rate, money supply growth rate, exchange rate, inflation rate, interest rate, government expenditures, net domestic credit, oil and commodity price volatilities, and a dummy variable for the global financial crisis. The starting point in the estimation of the models is the use of Exponential Generalized Auto-regressive Conditional Heteroskedaticity (EGARCH) to examine the asymmetric effects of oil and commodity price volatilities on the economic growth of SSA. Relevant econometric tests such as tests for the stationarity of variables (unit root tests), long run relationship test (test for cointegration), Wald tests and Lag selection criteria were performed in order to avoid the problems of spurious regression and unreliable results. Basically, the study used panel data regressions and the panel results revealed the presence of cross sectional dependence which necessitated the breaking down of the analyses into individual economic blocs of CEMAC, EAC, ECOW AS and SADC. In order to capture the first objective of the study, the Panel-ARDL approach of cointegration analysis, which most satisfies the outcomes of the unit root tests was employed. The fixed and random effects models supported by dynamic panel model formed the basis of the analysis for objective two. An eightvariable Structural-VAR was employed to generate Impulse Response Functions and Variance Decompositions for the analysis of objectives three and four of the study. Under the first objective, the GDP, which represents output, was confirmed as an important determinant of monetary policy dynamics across the four economic blocs, even though, this was more grounded in SADC and CEMAC where financial deepening is very effective. The second variable investigated, which is money supply growth rate (financial deepening), is found to have a significant impact on monetary policy dynamics in SSA but the effect is more pronounced in SADC, EAC and CEMAC. The findings further underscore the effect of financial deepening or effective money supply in monetary policy effectiveness in SSA. The next variable, which is exchange rate, was confirmed from the results as an important factor that affects monetary policy dynamics across the four economic blocs in SSA. Although it plays different roles across the economic blocs, the impact has generally been shown to be significant on monetary policy dynamics in SSA. Unlike other variables however, inflation did not display an overwhelming influence as an important variable affecting monetary policy dynamics in SSA as a whole. In spite of this, its effect was found significant in the two largest economic blocs of ECOW AS and SADC. However, government expenditure, net domestic credit and gross capital formation fail to exhibit a noticeable impact as determinants on monetary policy dynamics across all four economic unions in SSA. The result of the impact of monetary policy variables on the economic growth of SSA shows that the dynamics in monetary policy during the period under review have a significant impact on the economic growth of SSA but this varies from one economic bloc to another. For instance, exchange rate shows a more diverse result as it reveals that its impact is more pronounced in ECOW AS than the other three blocs. The influence of other macroeconomic variables such as inflation rate accounted for significant changes in the economic outlook of SSA with their attendant effects on the relationship between monetary policy and economic growth as well. The results of the dynamic interactions between monetary policy variables and economic growth of SSA show that monetary policy dynamics is greatly influenced by the external shocks from both oil and commodity price volatilities and the transmission mechanism channels indicate that this is passed through the monetary policy rate to exchange rate, and from exchange rate to GDP growth rate in CEMAC. As for the other economic blocs, the medium of transmission is through exchange rate to monetary policy rate and finally to GDP growth rate. Consequently, the medium of transmission of external shocks to the domestic economies in SSA is exchange rate for ECOW AS, SADC and EAC but in CEMAC, monetary policy rate is the medium of transmission. In summary, expansion of the economic base of the region, increase in domestic output, policy harmonization, import restrictions and improved infrastructural facilities coupled with increased agricultural productivities are some of the proffered policy recommendations for the SSACs.",NA,"https://repository.nwu.ac.za/handle/10394/36825","Olamide_2017_monetary",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,1424

However, the current research just focused on a single format of digital finance, lacking comprehensive analysis at the overall level and the refinement of general rules. Therefore, this paper constructed a spatial econometric model to empirically analyze the impact of digital finance on the effectiveness of monetary policy and its heterogeneity, taking China as the representative of emerging market countries. The empirical test showed that (1) Although the total index of digital finance had a negative impact on economic growth, the interaction between digital finance and monetary policy was significantly positive. This indicated that the “moderating effect” of monetary policy was beneficial to digital finance in promoting economic growth, which was confirmed from the subindexes level as well. (2) The development of digital finance had obvious characteristics of the “polarization effect” and the “spatial spillover effect”. Meanwhile, there was a significant regional difference in the “moderating effect” of monetary policy. (3) In terms of control variables, consumption level, fixed capital formation level, and fiscal policy all had a significant positive impact on economic growth, with a positive “spatial spillover effect”. Whereas, the impacts of COVID-19 and export level on economic growth were both negative. Hence, coping with the challenges of COVID-19 and revitalizing exports were important breakthroughs for emerging market countries to recover the domestic economy. Finally, based on the empirical conclusions, this paper proposed three suggestions. First, monetary policy should be strengthened to intervene in the development of digital finance. Second, digital financial development should be integrated into the quantitative framework of monetary policy. Third, it is essential to build a “double pillar” policy framework to compensate for the shortage of monetary policy.","10.1080/1331677X.2021.1997619","https://doi.org/10.1080/1331677X.2021.1997619","Jiang_2022_will",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,1434

In this context, it is stressed that labour market structures and trend labour market outcomes are primarily determined by national economic policies. The report then recalls that, in many circumstances, inflation and employment move together and pursuing price stability is conducive to supporting employment. However, in response to economic shocks that give rise to a temporary trade-off between employment and inflation stabilisation, the ECB’s medium-term orientation in pursuing price stability is shown to provide flexibility to contribute to the achievement of the EU’s full employment objective. Regarding the conduct of monetary policy in a low interest rate environment, model-based simulations suggest that history-dependent policy approaches − which have been proposed to overcome lasting shortfalls of inflation due to the effective lower bound on nominal interest rates by a more persistent policy response to disinflationary shocks − can help to bring employment closer to full employment, even though their effectiveness depends on the strength of the postulated expectations channels. Finally, the importance of employment income and wealth inequality in the transmission of monetary policy strengthens the case for more persistent or forceful easing policies (in pursuit of price stability) when interest rates are constrained by their lower bound.",NA,"https://papers.ssrn.com/abstract=3928297","Brand_2021_employment",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,1436

The data employed in this study covers 34 Sub-Saharan African (SSA) countries using annual data from the World Bank Development Indicators (WDI), World Bank Governance Index (WGI) and Trading Economics data bank from 1995 to 2019, a span of 24 years. Given the different monetary policy regimes in Sub-Saharan Africa, the data was separated into fixed exchange rate regime countries and non-fixed exchange rate regime countries, and I conducted a separate estimation between the two regimes to compare the different results. The model was estimated using a panel model with random effect specification based on the outcome of the Hausman test conducted. The model relates inflation as a function of money supply, real interest rate, foreign exchange rate, real GDP, government expenditure, Brent oil prices and some exogenous variables such as population growth and government effectiveness which serve as a proxy for private consumption and institutional credibility respectively. Pre-estimation analysis was also conducted to ensure we have a clear understanding of the nature and distribution of the data to identify the most appropriate estimation to have accurate and reliable findings for statistical inference. The results of our estimation indicate that money supply has the only significant effect on inflation while government expenditure, real GDP, foreign exchange rate, Brent oil prices, government effectiveness, population growth and real interest rate have an insignificant or no effect on inflation in non-fixed exchange rate regimes. On the other hand, for fixed exchange rate regimes, Real interest rates, foreign exchange rates, Brent oil prices, government expenditure, population growth and government effectiveness have a significant effect on inflation while money supply and real GDP insignificantly affect inflation.  The study recommends that non-fixed exchange rate regimes should control inflation through manipulating the money supply; On the other hand, in fixed exchange rate regimes a credibility effect may explain the lack of correlation between money supply and inflation. In order to maintain credibility, it might be appropriate to pursue an effective exchange rate policy through an efficient governance system possibly coupled with a sustainable fiscal policy addressing the problems arising from government expenditure and private consumption.",NA,"https://etd.adm.unipi.it/t/etd-09032021-153756/","JALLOW_2021_the",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,1439

Examination of relationships between monetary policy and economic activity at a detailed, disaggregated level indicates several changes within the past quarter century that are broadly consistent with these changes in the underlying economic environment: First, the elimination of major episodes of credit rationing in the mortgage market has clearly rendered housing less sensitive to restrictive monetary policy; moreover, there is no solid evidence of change in the sensitivity of homebuilding to mortgage interest rates. Second, business fixed investment has become more sensitive to financial market conditions, at least in the short run. Third, consumer spending has become less sensitive to interest rate increases and stock price declines, at least in situations that persist for lengthy periods of time.

By mandate member countries are required to consider economic conditions in the broader Euro area when setting interest rate policy and, as I show, there is little empirical evidence suggesting that this is not the case. Because larger countries by definition make up a larger fraction of these economic conditions, policy will favor their economic interests more often than not. The remainder of this dissertation use data from the Survey of Professional Forecasters to examine the effects of monetary policy on the term structure of inflation expectations in the United States. In Chapter 3 I use the unobserved components i model, which decomposes inflation expectations at any horizon into latent components representing short- and long-run expectations and measurement error, to estimate the term structure of inflation expectations from 1992 to 2018. I show how the model can be extended to allow for two departures from rational expectations and find that each of these channels is statistically significant over the sample period. Contractionary monetary policy lowers inflation expectations after a lag of several years, an effect which is driven by the response of long-run inflation expectations which remain permanently lower after the policy move. Because interest rates and long-run inflation expectations are cointegrated in this model, contractionary monetary policy additionally lowers future interest rates. In Chapter 4 I propose a new method to calculate the impulse response of the term structure using local projections. The method uses the law of iterated expectations to derive a set of linear cross-equation restrictions which substantially reduce the number of parameters to estimate. I then apply the term structure local projections to estimate the response of the term structures of inflation expectations and interest rates after a monetary policy shock. My results confirm the findings in Chapter 3: higher interest rates today cause both inflation expectations and interest rates to decline in the future. I additionally show that monetary policy effects long-run interest rates by changing expectations of future short-run interest rates, rather than adjustments to the term premium.",NA,"https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=eoh&AN=1868982&site=ehost-live","McNeil_2020_an",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,1448

The approach is applied to a panel data set spanning 162 countries (over the period 1970-2017), in which it identifies 147 large monetary contractions. The procedure selects episodes where a protracted period of loose monetary policy was suddenly followed by sizeable interest rate increases. Focusing on contractions of significant size increases the signal-to-noise ratio, while they are unlikely to be accompanied by confounding ""information effects"" (markets interpreting a rate hike as the Central Bank being optimistic about the real side of the economy). A subsequent panel VAR analysis suggests that, on average, a 100-basis point rate hike reduces real GDP by 0.5 percent. This reduction in output seems to be persistent, pointing to a certain degree of hysteresis. The price level falls by 1.5 percent, indicating that the medium-/long-run impact of contractionary monetary shocks is not characterized by a neo-Fisherian response.

First, they violate the exogeneity condition as they capture the Bank's endogenous response to credit market spreads motivated by the predictive information for inflation in those spreads. Second, they are anticipated by financial market participants and hence give rise to the issue of non-fundamentalness in SVAR models. I will explore the relevance of these two issues in turn. In the first step, I will assess the effects of monetary policy when estimated using the residuals from the Taylor-type policy rule augmented by credit spreads (regression BT-CS of Table 1) as my monetary policy shock series. These ‘first-stage’ residuals are independent of the Bank's response to financial market conditions but are still anticipated to some extent as shown in Section 3.2 (Table 3; Figure 5). In the second step, I will then remove this anticipatory component from these ‘first-stage’ residuals by purging them of the expected cash rate change by financial market participants (Table 3). At each step, I will estimate the effects of monetary policy on the variables of interest in a simple SVAR with four lags similar to RR, Coibion (2012) and BT. Accordingly, the VAR includes (log) underlying CPI, (log) real GDP, the unemployment rate and a measure of the policy shock, in that order. Here, the policy shock replaces the cash rate typically included to measure the stance of monetary policy. Since the cash rate is typically included in levels, I cumulate the quarterly shock series over time.

Evidence Based on VAR Estimates",2009,NA,NA,NA,"journalArticle","Empirical evidence on whether the euro area monetary transmission process has changed is, at best, mixed. We argue that this inconclusiveness is likely to be due to the fact that existing empirical studies concentrate on the effects of a particular development on a specific transmission channel. Another problem of this literature is that specific changes could have off-setting effects regarding the overall effectiveness of monetary policy, leaving open the question whether the ability of monetary policy to control inflation has been altered. In order to shed light on this issue, we investigate whether there has been a significant change in the overall transmission of monetary policy to inflation and output by estimating a standard VAR for the euro area and by searching for a possible break date. We find a significant break point around 1996 and some evidence for a second one around 1999. We compare impulse responses to a monetary policy shock for these episodes and find that the well-known 'stylised facts' of monetary policy transmission remain valid. Therefore, we argue that the general guiding principles of the Eurosystem monetary policy remain adequate. Moreover, it seems that monetary transmission after 1998 is not very different from before 1996, but probably very different in the interim period. This implies that evidence for the euro area could be biased by an 'atypical' interim period 1996-1999.

The theoretical model motivates our empirical assessment, based on a regime-switching Phillips curve and a regime-switching monetary structural VAR, employing different filter-based, semi-structural model-based and Bayesian factor model-implied output gaps. The analysis confirms the presence of a convex relationship between inflation and the output gap, meaning that the coefficient in the Phillips curve on the output gap recurringly increases during times of expansion and abates during recessions. Sign-restricted monetary policy shocks based on a regime-switching monetary SVAR reveal that expansionary monetary policy induces less pressure on inflation at times of weak as opposed to strong growth; thereby rationalizing relatively stronger expansionary policy, including unconventional volume-based policy, during times of deep recession.

The hypothesis of this research is that the interaction of fiscal and monetary policies has a synergistic effect on economic growth and that at certain stages, one of these policies prevails over the other. This hypothesis was tested with the help of an IS-LM model, which was used to investigate the joint effects of monetary and fiscal policies on business activity in Belarus. A Markov switching model was developed in Eviews software to analyze the interaction between these policies. Regression dependences of the average tax burden (including the burden imposed by social security contributions) and GDP, investment and the refinancing rate were built by using Excel software. To solve the IS-LM model, the value of autonomous consumption was computed with the help of the adjusted value of the average propensity to consume. It was found that autonomous consumption is comparable with the budget of subsistence minimum in Belarus. The share of government spending in the GDP structure was on average 35.01%. The comparison of gross savings and investment showed that in the majority of periods, gross savings insignificantly exceeded the amount of investment, that is, the available funds were used for consumer lending rather than for investment.

The study uses Quarterly data between 1970 Q1 to 2011Q4, being a sample period of forty one years. The study further, introduces structural break to investigate the presence of a possible structural change which takes into account the effects of the Structural Adjustment Programme introduced by the Nigerian government in the 1987. The data was split into two sub-periods from 1970Q1–1986Q4, era before the Structural adjustment programme, and from 1987Q1 – 2011Q4, period after the Structural Adjustment Programme in Nigeria. In this study, three approaches were utilised in the methodology. First, estimation and analysis was based on coefficients of the variables using long-run and co-integrating Vector Error Correction Model (VECM). The results confirm my a priori expectation, although many of the variables were not statistically significant. The study also estimates the period 1970Q1–2011Q4, without a structural break for the GDP model having been confirmed in a structural break test. Therefore, we accept the null hypothesis which means that there was no structural break in real domestic growth during the structural adjustment programme, introduced in 1987. However, the structural break tests for consumers’ price index (CPI) and balance of payments (BOP) show that the parameters of the analysed equations were not stable given that recursive errors cut across the critical lines for both tests. As a result of the foregoing, we reject the null hypothesis meaning that there was a structural break for the CPI and (BOP) models. This means that the structural adjustment programme introduced in 1987 brought about a change in CPI and BOP in the Nigerian economy. In the second approach of the methodology, a macroeconomic model was simulated to demonstrate the effects of monetary policy on macroeconomic performance. Thus, the results obtained from the simulation are impressive and generally satisfactory; the results suggest the effectiveness of monetary policy implementation for counter cyclical income stabilization, BOP stabilization and CPI stabilization in Nigeria. In the third approach of my methodology, three structural vector autoregressive (SVAR) econometric models were formulated to trace the effects of monetary policy shocks on domestic output, consumers’ price index and balance of payments position in Nigeria. Structural effects of monetary shocks or innovations were captured by the impulse response functions and the forecast error variance decomposition. The empirical impulse-response assessment indicates that an exogenous shock to the short-term interest rate has the most significant positive effect on real domestic output and consumers’ price followed by a transitory effect of the broad money. The response of the country’s external payments’ position to a structural shock as measured by a one-standard deviation innovation in all the policy variables is almost zero. The policy implication is straightforward- monetary policy in Nigeria is effective in maintaining internal balance and ineffective in achieving external balance. Overall, the results suggest that monetary policy affects macroeconomic performance in Nigeria.",NA,"https://gala.gre.ac.uk/id/eprint/13591/","Isedu_2013_effects",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,1477

Design/methodology/approach Vector autoregresion (VARs) within the frameworks of Vector Error Correction Models and simple Granger causality models are used to estimate the long- and short-run effects, respectively. A battery of robustness checks are also used to ensure consistency in the specifications and results. Findings The tested hypotheses are valid under monetary policy independence and dependence, except few exceptions. H1: Monetary policy variables affect prices in the long-run but not in the short-run. For the first-half (long-run dimension) of the hypothesis, permanent changes in monetary policy variables (depth, efficiency, activity and size) affect permanent variations in prices in the long-term. But in cases of disequilibriums, only financial dynamic fundamentals of depth and size significantly adjust inflation to the cointegration relations. With respect to the second-half (short-run view) of the hypothesis, monetary policy does not overwhelmingly affect prices in the short-term. Hence, but for a thin exception, H1 is valid. H2: Monetary policy variables influence output in the short-term but not in the long-term. With regard to the short-term dimension of the hypothesis, only financial dynamics of depth and size affect real gross domestic product output in the short-run. As concerns the long-run dimension, the neutrality of monetary policy has been confirmed. Hence, the hypothesis is also broadly valid. Practical implications A wide range of policy implications are discussed. Inter alia: the long-run neutrality of money and business cycles, credit expansions and inflationary tendencies, inflation targeting and monetary policy independence implications. Country-/regional-specific implications, the manner in which the findings reconcile the ongoing debate, measures for fighting surplus liquidity and caveats and future research directions are also discussed. Originality/value By using a plethora of hitherto unemployed financial dynamics (that broadly reflect monetary policy), we provide significant contributions to the empirics of money. The conclusion of the analysis is a valuable contribution to the scholarly and policy debate on how money matters as an instrument of economic activity in developing countries.","10.1108/IGDR-12-2012-0048","https://doi.org/10.1108/IGDR-12-2012-0048","A.

How is a financial shock identified? Using different economic models, this dissertation addresses these questions. In Chapter 1, I construct an economic model with Iacoviello's (2005) heterogeneous style, financial intermediaries, a risk-rating mechanism, and Calvo-style sticky price. I find that monetary policy should respond to bank spread, an instrumental variable for a financial shock. Optimal monetary rules with high financial stability targeting would increase the response to this spread. Sub-optimal monetary rules with a high response to inflation also respond more to this spread. Additionally, I show that monetary and fiscal policy coordination is necessary and that fiscal policy becomes more important when a financial shock becomes more volatile. Motivated by an empirical VAR model (a la Christiano et al., 1999), Chapter 2 models an economy with financial intermediaries and a financial shock. There is also a risk-rating mechanism based on a firms' external finance dependence since firms need heterogeneous funds for a new investment. I propose a set of economic indicators to identify this shock. I again show that the conduct of monetary policy should pay attention to stability in the financial market while still keeping an eye on other horizons, including inflation and output. If so, the cost of price rigidity is lower and the social aggregate welfare is higher. The last chapter empirically examines if a financial shock, which plays an important role in the theoretical models in the first two chapters, is significant. Bank spread as the difference between the prime rate and the deposit rate, is augmented into a standard VAR model as well as an ARIMAX model to investigate the properties of a disturbance to this spread. I find that this disturbance has an estimated standard error of about 0.0015, relatively significant in comparison with a monetary shock of about 0.003 in literature. In addition, a financial shock and a monetary shock have similar contributions to the fluctuations in economic activities. It means that such a financial disturbance should be carefully observed.",NA,"https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=eoh&AN=1267678&site=ehost-live","Vu_2010_essays",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,2516

The first chapter builds a DSGE search and match model that can capture the labor market facts and explain the business cycle facts within a tractable framework. The basic framework incorporates labor market frictions to the standard new Keynesian model and extends it with staggered wage contracts. The empirical performance of the model is tested by the impulse responses of the key macroeconomic variables to a monetary policy shock. It shows that incorporating search and matching frictions and a bargaining framework into the baseline new Keynesian model can generate a lower response for inflation and the real wage to a monetary policy shock and can explain some of the labor market facts simultaneously. The second chapter analyzes the effects of alternative labor market institutions on the responses of key macroeconomic variables. It considers severance payments, unemployment benefits and worker's bargaining power. The impulse responses of key macroeconomic variables are derived under alternative parameterizations for these institutions. It finds that the severance payments do not have an impact on the responses. Increasing the unemployment benefits makes key macroeconomic variables less responsive to disturbances where increasing worker's bargaining power makes output more responsive and inflation less responsive to macroeconomic shocks. Third chapter explores the differences between the characteristics of the business cycles in the US and the euro area. It first compares the features of the business cycles dated by the NBER and CEPR; then, it looks at the characteristics of the business cycles derived from the real GDP and industrial production.

In particular, it considers the role of interenterprise arrears in the transmission process, as well as the question of whether monetary impulses could affect the sectoral pattern of the industrial recession. It appeal's that the fall in output related to monetary contraction may be significant, given the deficiencies of the credit market, while distortions associated with the policy (which resulted in a lack of liquid assets in the system and was translated into the outburst of quasi-money and extremely high interest rates) may lengthen the recession. Underdevelopment of the financial sector alters the propagation mechanisms of monetary impulses. The lending channel, which is likely to remain the main channel in initial stages of transition, is significantly modified in comparison with the one in developed economies. On the supply side the lack of adequate substitutes for the Central bank of Russia (CBR) loanable funds, reflecting the structural weakness of the banking system, intensifies the decline of credit supply in periods of monetary tightening. On the demand side the lack of substitutes for bank credit deepens enterprise-side reaction, adversely affecting the viability of firms in the long-run. We examine the role of interenterprise arrears using a two-sector (energy vs manufacturing) non-Walrasian general equilibrium model with price regulation and credit rationing. The model explains the transactions’ role of money and reveals that interenterprise arrears may soften or strengthen production-side responses to monetary impulse in the steady state (if compared with the case when no arrears are allowed). The precise results depend on the characteristics of the production function and the transaction cost function, and the level of real money balances. Empirical evidence appears to favor the “cushioning” effect of arrears. The model allows one to highlight the mechanisms through which policy, meant to fight inflation, could cause an increase in inflation together with a decline of both sectors’ output and consumption. Two versions of the model are considered: one with credit rationing of both sectors, and one with asymmetric rationing. The latter appeal's to receive significant empirical support for 1994-96, suggesting that deeper decline in the manufacturing sector may partially, along with other reasons, be explained by its higher exposure to credit-rationing, and therefore, higher losses associated with monetary tightening. A relaxation of the credit rationing constraint to the second sector, and/or a decrease in interest rates, may be growth promoting strategies, implying that there is scope for governmental intervention",NA,"https://www.proquest.com/openview/622412611068e6651f7f6c0674db002f/1?pq-origsite=gscholar&cbl=2026366&diss=y","NA_NA_monetary",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,1489

In identifying those shocks, we do not impose any restrictions on the sign of the key variable of interest. We find that private investment and consumption significantly increase due to expansionary government expenditure shock. Such an increase in private consumption is consistent with neo-Keynesian prediction. The fall in output due to the tax increase shock is highly robust. Private consumption also decreases due to a tax increase, although investment does not.

The virus outbreak has had a serious impact on global health and has caused an economic downturn that is heavily driven by the restrictions implemented to attenuate the health-crisis. Apart from affecting the mobility of individuals, these restrictions impose additional constraints that policy makers need to adhere to when conducting macroeconomic policy as means of mitigating the negative economic effects of the crisis. This thesis investigates what role the level of restrictions play in the extent to which fiscal and monetary policy announcements are able to stimulate economic activity. This is done by estimating several random effects models using a daily panel dataset consisting of 18 euro area countries from 2020-02-15 to 2021-02-25. Interestingly, the results indicate a positive response in economic activity from fiscal policy announcements in the countries subject to the most stringent restrictions, and a negative response in the remaining countries. This suggests a reverse restriction-uncertainty relationship where uncertainty could be the driving force, which increases in surrounding countries as a response to more stringent restrictions in another. This could fuel a “wait and see”-behaviour which has a negative impact on economic activity. The effect of monetary policy is seen to differ across time, rather than across national levels of restrictions. This is suggested to occur due to the (brief) existence of positive animal spirit voiced in an initially positive response from expansionary monetary policy in all countries. This effect is later revised and turns negative, likely due to a Ricardian Equivalence-like response to the unconventional monetary policy interventions.",NA,NA,"Almgren_NA_mobility",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,1519

This implies relative price movements in commodities may have important consequences for economic growth and poverty reduction. Taking a long-run perspective, we examine the historical relation between a new aggregate index of commodity prices, economic activity, and interest rates. Initial empirical tests show that commodity prices present a downward trend with breaks over the entire industrial age, providing clear support for the Prebisch–Singer hypothesis. It would also appear that this trend has declined at a faster rate since the 1870s. Conversely, several GDP series such as World, Chile, China, UK, and US, trend upward with breaks. Such trending behavior in both commodity prices and economic activity suggests a latent common factor like technological innovation. To assess the relationships between economic series, we apply a stationary VAR (Vector Autoregression) to model movements around trends. Strikingly, there is evidence that commodity prices Granger cause income and interest rates, while interest rates Granger cause commodity prices. From these results and the related impulse response function analysis, the historical perspective provides some useful information for contemporary policy makers. For example, loose monetary policy has tended to support higher commodity prices. Moreover, commodity price movements have an asymmetric country effect on economic activity; periods of falling commodity prices will support GDP growth for commodity importers like the US but depress growth for commodity exporters such as Chile.","10.1016/j.worlddev.2016.07.012","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0305750X16304193","Harvey_2017_longrun",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,1525

Chapter 1: The Implications of Financial Institutions' Balance Sheets for Business Cycle Fluctuations In the first chapter, we study the implications of financial intermediaries' balance sheets for aggregate fluctuations. We extend the seminal work of Bernanke et al. (1999) by adding a verification problem between financial institutions and potential savers into their original model. This modification yields a new financial DSGE model in which the effects of both corporations' and banks' balance sheets are presented. Our numerical studies reveal that the model with a one-sided verification problem, either between corporate firms and financial institutions or between financial borrowers and their depositors, replicates the result of that with two-sided frictions. This indicates that our proposed method to unravel credit market imperfections into two types of balance sheet components may be inappropriate, and hence provides an elusive depiction of the importance of the effects of banks' balance sheets during business cycles. Finally, the paper suggests that the type of frictions that are required for modeling the joint effect of both balance sheet channels should involve endogenizing banks' capital adequacy ratio or producing cyclical variations of intermediaries' financing premium to their leverage ratio. Chapter 2: Intersectoral Linkages and the Effects of Monetary Policy The second chapter studies the dynamic responses to monetary shocks of economic activities in durable and nondurable sectors. We extend the study of Bouakez et al. (2011) by introducing the chains of investment linkages, i.e. the use of intersectoral outputs in producing investment goods in each sector. We show that the newly added ingredient can generate several patterns of sectoral responses to monetary policy shocks that are more consistent with empirical findings. Particularly, this feature can resolve the negative comovement puzzle between durable and nondurable consumption; the result arises without requiring the imperfect labor market mobility as needed in the original work of Bouakez et al. (2011), where intermediate input-output linkages only were included. Having applied our two-layer linkages model to quantify the importance of monetary factor, we find that monetary policy shocks alone can account for 16% of the volatility of real GDP in the data. Not only does this figure roughly stand in line with previous literature, but also this suggests that other types of shocks should be incorporated into a multi-sectoral DSGE model for the purpose of explaining the U.S. aggregate volatilities and business cycles. Chapter 3: Shocks and Frictions in U.S. Business Cycles: An Analysis through the Lens of a Multi-sector DSGE Model. In the third chapter, we offer empirical evidence that during the Great Moderation Era, U.S. business cycles could largely be driven by common technology shocks. Built on the two-layer intersectoral linkages model developed in chapter 2, we quantify the importance of monetary policy shocks and the total factor productivity (TFP) of durable and nondurable sectors for U.S. business cycles. The model is extended to include nominal rigidities in wage. Our study documents the exogenous variations in the three underlying disturbances using classical linear regression techniques. Exogenous disturbances to the sectoral TFPs, as obtained from the estimates of a VAR(1) model, are found to be positively correlated, and therefore cannot be directly used for a structural interpretation. Using a novel identifying method that takes into account the correlation of the two innovations in sectoral TFPs, we decompose their exogenous variations into one commonly-driven shock and two idiosyncratic shocks. The former is interpreted as common technology shocks; the latter two are interpreted as sectoral shocks. Our finding stands in opposition to other recent studies using multi-sectoral DSGE models that highlight the importance of sectoral shocks.

The procedure selects episodes where a protracted period of loose monetary policy was suddenly followed by sizeable nominal interest rate increases. Focusing on contractions of significant size increases the signal-to-noise ratio, while they are unlikely to be accompanied by confounding ""information effects"" (markets interpreting a rate hike as the Central Bank being optimistic about the real side of the economy). A subsequent panel VAR analysis suggests that a 100-basis point rate hike reduces real GDP by 0.5 percent. This reduction in output seems to be persistent, pointing to a certain degree of hysteresis. The price level falls by 1.5 percent, indicating that the medium-/long-run impact of contractionary monetary shocks is not characterized by a neo-Fisherian response.

Results: The proposed model suggests that the rate of unemployment is conditioned by the financial cycle and monetary policy (Ml/GDP, Loans/GDP), as well as the business cycle and fiscal policy (gross d/BDP) and that a controlled and properly directed level of monetization of the economy (Ml/BDP) and financial development measured as Loans/GDP can be ""sufficient"" for economic growth.

Our estimates show that regulation shocks have been the major driver of China's rising shadow banking during 2009-2016. Shadow banking leads to a higher amount of credit in the economy by helping escape constraints from traditional intermediaries, however financial frictions in the shadow banking sector create a ""dual financial acceleration"" mechanism.

To fight this recession, policy makers in central banks engaged in expansionary monetary policy. This paper asks whether the measures adopted by the US Federal Reserve (Fed) have been effective in boosting real activity and calming financial markets. To measure these effects at high frequencies, we propose a novel mixed frequency vector autoregressive (MF-VAR) model. This model allows us to combine weekly and monthly information within a unified framework. Our model combines a set of macroeconomic aggregates such as industrial production, unemployment rates, and inflation with high-frequency information from financial markets such as stock prices, interest rate spreads, and weekly information on the Fed's balance sheet size. The latter set of high-frequency time series is used to dynamically interpolate the monthly time series to obtain weekly macroeconomic measures. We use this setup to simulate counterfactuals in absence of monetary stimulus. The results show that the monetary expansion caused higher output growth and stock market returns, more favorable long-term financing conditions and a depreciation of the US dollar compared with a no-policy benchmark scenario.","10.1111/sjpe.12275","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/sjpe.12275","Feldkircher_2021_measuring",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,1557

The responses of macroeconomic policy targets to the trio of Monetary policy rate, Cash reserve ratio and Exchange rate and their comparative impacts in achievement of monetary policy goals cannot be over emphasized. The paper attempts to determine the most suitable of the monetary policy instruments for the Nigerian economy, so as to aid the CBN in making a decisive policy. Hence, the broad objective of this study is to empirically determine the effects of monetary policy instruments on economic growth in Nigeria. In order to obtain estimates and results that are consistent and not methodology biased, two econometric estimation techniques were used. And these are Autoregressive Distributed Lag Model (ARDL) and Vector Error correction model (VECM) after necessary test on reliability of data are conducted. The choice of the ARDL is based on several considerations. Also, due to the change in government policy i.e 2006 bank consolidation, test for structural stability was carried out using CUSUM, CUSUMSQ and Chow test. Standardized regression was used to find out the comparative or relative effects of the monetary policy instruments (Monetary policy rate, Cash reserve ratio, and Exchange rate) on the target variable (Economic growth,).T-statistics and F-statistic were used to carry out statistical significance at 95% confidence level. Coefficient of multiple determinations (R2) was also used to judge the strength of the estimated regression equation. Also, Durbin Watson statistic was used to test for the presence of serial correlation (Autocorrelation), which is also common in time series data. From the analysis of the model for both alternative sub periods, the coefficients of the estimated regression (for both ARDL and VECM) are not the same in the two sub periods. There are significant changes in the coefficients of the policy variables. This means that the 2006 structural reform in the financial sector in Nigeria brought changes in monetary policy rate, CRR , exchange rate and also changes in economic growth. Also, from the two sub periods CRR does not have any significant effects on economic growth in short run, but it has effects in the long run. In the short run, in both sub periods, monetary policy rate does not have significant effect on economic growth. Also in the long run, it does not have significant effects on economic growth in both sub periods.

We find that real house prices are pro-cyclical - co-moving with real GDP, consumption, investment, CPI inflation, budget and current account balances, and output gaps. House price booms are typically preceded by a period of easing monetary policy, but then diminishing slack and rising inflation lead monetary authorities to begin tightening policy before house prices peak. In a careful reading of official reports, speeches, and minutes, we find little evidence that foreign central banks have reacted to past episodes of rising real house prices beyond taking into account their implications for inflation and output growth. However, central bankers have expressed a range of opinions in the more recent policy debate with some willing in certain cases to raise policy rates to try to stem current and future surges in asset prices while others favor moral suasion or a hands-off approach. Finally, we characterize the risks associated with house-price reversals. Although mortgage lenders in some countries have significant exposure to house prices, the balance of evidence suggests that this exposure does not, in and of itself, pose a significant risk to financial stability. Nevertheless, the co-movement of both property prices and default rates with the business cycle means that losses on mortgage lending are likely to be higher when banks' other lines of business are also performing poorly.","10.2139/ssrn.816946","https://papers.ssrn.com/abstract=816946","Ahearne_2005_monetary",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,1574

Second, in contrast to the existing TVAR literature, which concentrates exclusively on single-threshold models, we allow for the presence of a second threshold, which is overwhelmingly supported by all relevant statistical tests. Our results indicate that the dynamics of the interactions among credit market conditions, monetary policy and economic activity change considerably as the economy moves from one phase of the business cycle to another and that single-threshold TVAR models are too restrictive to fully capture the nonlinear nature of those interactions. The impact of most shocks tends to be largest during periods of subpar economic activity and smallest during times of moderate economic growth.

Lastly, I empirically evaluate a policy interest rule to determine the implicit weight the policymaker puts on the country-specific inflation and output growth differentials in addition to the aggregate. The results show that monetary policy interventions do not generate significant differences in the inflation behavior across the countries, while they create significant differences in the output dynamics. Moreover, monetary policy innovations do account for a large portion of country-specific output fluctuations. This is in contrast to the business cycle literature where only a small fraction of output variance is attributed to the monetary policy shocks. In addition, it appears that while targeting the aggregate inflation and output dynamics, monetary authority stabilizes cross-country inflation in the face of idiosyncratic shocks fairly well, though there are considerable differences in the welfare losses associated with the cross-country output variability.

The success of macroeconomic stabilization, typically in the hands of monetary policy, is not only determined by a suitable choice of the nominal anchor, which shapes the reaction function of monetary policy, but also the constraints within which the monetary policy strives to achieve its objectives. The key attributes of the constraints to macroeconomic stabilization are economic rigidities and structural shocks. By benchmarking the estimated economic rigidities and structural shocks faced by Macedonia to those faced by Slovakia, we find that Macedonia has relatively weaker transmission mechanisms of monetary policy, higher output rigidity, a lower exchange rate pass-through, and faces larger external shocks. For Macedonia, these relatively higher constraints on monetary policy together with the chosen exchange rate anchor result in higher output and inflation volatility relative to Slovakia.

To accomplish the task, we develop Dynamic Stochastic General Equilibrium models with financial frictions. In the first chapter, we develop a model to analytically determine the appropriate price index to target in the presence of financial frictions (where a fraction of households are constrained to consume their wage income each period). The analysis suggests that in the presence of financial frictions, a welfare-maximizing central bank should adopt flexible headline inflation targeting--i.e. a headline inflation target but with some weight on the output gap. These results are particularly relevant for emerging markets, where the share of food expenditures in total consumption expenditures is high and a large proportion of consumers are credit constrained. In the second chapter, we develop a small open economy model with macro-financial linkages. The model includes a financial accelerator--entrepreneurs are assumed to partially finance investment using domestic and foreign currency debt--to assess the importance of financial frictions in the amplification and propagation of the effects of transitory shocks to productivity, interest rates and net worth of firms. We use Bayesian estimation techniques to estimate the model using India data. The model is used to assess the importance of the financial accelerator in India and to assess the optimality of the current monetary policy rule. In the third chapter, we develop a small open economy New Keynesian model with financial frictions and an active banking sector for India. We find that the presence of a monopolistic banking sector with sticky interest rate setting attenuates the shocks. However, if the interest rates are flexible it results in the amplification of shocks. We also find that an unexpected reduction in bank capital can have a substantial impact on the real economy and particularly on investment. Use of non-monetary policy tools result in greater volatility as compared to when central banks use traditional monetary tightening.",NA,"https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=eoh&AN=1142265&site=ehost-live","Anand_2010_three",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,1589

Meanwhile, the impact on the price level appears to be stronger and shorter compared to the impact on output.

The data were sourced from CBN statistical bulletin and stationarity of the variables were carried out with ADF and PP. The long run long-run relationship among the variables was determined with ARDL bound test. The error correction term (ECM) shows that the headline inflation rate responds to the deviation from its long-run (steady) state, and it significantly adjusts to it. The error correction term is correctly signed, and it shows that about 77.3% of disequilibrium in the headline inflation rate due to one-time temporary shock is corrected within twelve months; this is a fast rate of adjustment. The findings revealed that the liquidity ratio had negative and insignificant immediate and long-run effects on the headline inflation and money supply rate had positive and significant immediate and long-run effects on the headline inflation rate in Nigeria. Also, monetary policy rate was found to reduce the headline inflation rate in the short-run only and treasury bill rate had positive and significant immediate and long-run effects on the headline inflation rate in Nigeria.

This will likely bring challenges, including macroeconomic instability and inflationary pressures due to potential rapid depreciation. In this context, certain key questions about emerging economies have become focal points of discussion in political and academic spheres: what are the effects of exchange rate depreciation on economic activity? Does exchange rate depreciation create inflationary pressure? Finding answers to these questions is critical for policymakers and financial market participants. As such, the purpose of this paper is to shed light on these questions and thus provides guidance on mitigating the negative impacts of shocks in four fast-growing emerging economies. Design/methodology/approach--The authors use a vector autoregression model with sign restrictions to examine the dynamic effects of exchange rate movements on fundamental macroeconomic indicators for four fast-growing countries, namely, Brazil, Turkey, Russia, and South Africa. Following Berument et al. (2012a), Ncube and Ndou (2013), Bjornland and Halvorsen (2013), and An et al. (2014), the authors adopt the sign restriction methodology to identify exchange rate shocks alongside other macroeconomic shocks (monetary policy and productivity shocks) leading to exchange rate fluctuations. Findings--The results show that exchange rate depreciation typically generates a deep recession and high inflation while improving the trade balance in the four emerging economies. This indicates that depreciation has strong ""stagflationary"" effects, which are transmitted to the macroeconomy primarily via supply-side channels, especially through the cost of import. Furthermore, the authors find that monetary policy reacts immediately to a domestic currency depreciation in all four emerging countries.",NA,"https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=eoh&AN=1603787&site=ehost-live","Yildirim_2016_exchange",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,1597

This study examined the emergence of this new mandate, with specific focus on the Nigerian economy between 1971 and 2014, using the vector autoregressive approach to estimate the interaction and feedback mechanism to check the connection between monetary policy instrument and the new mandate of unemployment and poverty reduction. Based on the findings, it recommended the use of conventional and unconventional monetary policies as option s for reducing unemployment and poverty in Nigeria.",NA,"http://jepa.unilag.edu.ng/article/view/772","Adeoye_2016_emergence",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,1600

Using a model with a hierarchical structure we capture the variability of GDP response to policy shocks both between and within the groups of advanced and emerging countries. Our results provide evidence that fiscal policy effects are heterogeneous across countries, with higher multipliers in advanced economies compared to emerging markets, while monetary policy is found to have more homogeneous effects on GDP. We then quantify the policy contribution on GDP growth in the last decade by means of a structural counterfactual analysis based on conditional forecasts. We find that global GDP growth benefited from substantial policy support during the global financial crisis but policy tightening thereafter, particularly fiscal consolidation, acted as a significant drag on the subsequent global recovery. In addition we show that the role of policy has differed across countries. Specifically, in advanced economies, highly accommodative monetary policy has been counteracted by strong fiscal consolidation.

Motivated by evidence from psychology, unemployment is modeled as a social norm. The norm is defined here as the belief that individuals in society prioritize, or should prioritize the search for gainful employment, whereas those who do not are perceived as outside the norm and, consequently, stigmatized. Households pressure the unemployed to find jobs: the fewer unemployed workers there are, the more supporters the norm has and therefore the greater the pressure and psychological cost experienced by each jobseeker. As this psychological cost is procyclical, it hinders the wage from absorbing most of the effect of the shock. Thus, the model is able to capture the high volatility of vacancies and unemployment observed in the data, accounting for the Shimer puzzle. The paper also departs from the literature by introducing price rigidity in the labor market, inducing additional inertia and persistence in inflation and the real wage after a monetary shock. The model's responses after a monetary shock are in line with the responses obtained from a VAR on US data.",NA,"https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=eoh&AN=1656082&site=ehost-live","Koursaros_2017_labor",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,1602

Inflation persistence shows the degree to which future values of inflation are associated with bygone shocks or, in other words, the speed of adjustment toward its long-run value. Indeed, inflation dynamics and the degree of inflation persistence have been recognized as the most essential parameters for affecting monetary policy’s performance. This study estimates the degree of inflation persistence and other macro-economic variables (under a multivariate Approach). Secondly, this study allows the long memory property of inflation persistence to examine the effect of monetary policy shocks on Pakistan’s economy.

We first identify the Taylor rule that best describes the reaction of both central banks and then we test both forward looking linear and nonlinear models. We conclude that a Logistic Smooth Transition Autoregressive (LSTAR) forward looking model of the Taylor rule best describes the US FED Funds rate while a linear Taylor rule with the inclusion of a dummy variable best describes the reaction of the Central Bank of Brazil (BCB). We then use in-sample forecast errors in order to derive and identify the unexpected monetary policy shocks for both countries. In line with Cover (1992), we use these shocks to explore any asymmetries in the conduct of monetary policy on the growth rate of the real industrial production.

In the first approach, we jointly estimate a model of inflation, survey expectations and monetary policy, where each is a function of a common time-varying inflation trend. In the estimates, long-term expectations track closely the unobserved trend that is an important factor in inflation dynamics, implying that changes in long-run expectations can lead to persistent movements in inflation. In the second approach, we estimate a time-varying parameter VAR with stochastic volatility. This model relaxes the cross-equation and constant parameter restrictions from the first model. Impulse response analysis shows a relatively stable relationship between inflation and survey measures of inflation, although with some modest changes consistent with improved anchoring of long-term expectations. Finally, we rely on a conventional VAR framework incorporating several macroeconomic variables, including both short- and long-term measures of expected inflation. In these estimates, shocks to either measure of expectations lead to a rise in the other measure and some limited pass-through to inflation.

It helped to stabilise financial markets and avoid deflation. Nonetheless, GDP growth has been sluggish and in some countries lower than expected given the measures taken, and estimated economic slack remains large. In this context, this paper assesses the effectiveness of monetary policy in recent years. It finds that notwithstanding an almost full transmission of policy interest rate cuts and unconventional policy measures to higher asset prices and lower cost of credit in and outside the banking sector in most countries, with the exception of vulnerable euro area economies, monetary policy stimulus did not show up in stronger growth due to a combination of three factors. First, lower policy interest rates may not have provided as much stimulus as expected given the evidence of a decrease in natural interest rates, resulting from the estimated decline in potential GDP growth in the wake of the crisis. Second, balance sheet adjustments of non-financial companies and households, large uncertainty as well as simultaneous and considerable fiscal consolidation in many OECD countries constituted important headwinds. Third, the bank lending channel of monetary policy transmission appears to have been impaired, mainly due to considerable balance sheet adjustments and prevailing uncertainty, which together limited banks’ capacity and willingness to supply credit.

Relying on the joint yields-macro latent factors model, this study empirically examines the effect of monetary policy stances on term structure and the possible feedback effect on the real sector using the Japanese experience of ZIRP. The analysis indicates that it is the entire term structure that transmits the policy shocks to the real economy rather than the yield spread only. The monetary policy signals pass through the yield curve level and slope factors to stimulate the economic activity. The curvature factor, besides reflecting the cyclical fluctuations of the economy, acts as a leading indicator for future inflation. In addition, policy influence tends to be low as the short end becomes segmented toward medium/long-term of the yield curve. Furthermore, volatility in bond markets is found to be asymmetrically affected by positive and negative shocks and long end tends to be less sensitive to stochastic shocks than the short maturities.

Estimates from the model shows that the real effect of monetary policy on credit growth is quantitatively small — a 2.5% rise in cash rate leads to a decline in real growth of credit to the private sector by 0.1%. Though, in responding to the macroeconomic consequences of the shock in growth of private sector credit, monetary policy appears to stabilise the economy effectively. At short horizons, shocks to monetary policy found to be a significant driver of credit growth. Over longer horizons, shocks to real output, past shocks to credit growth and external shocks plays a greater role. The contemporaneous effects of external shocks to the growth of private sector credit takes slightly more than two years to disappears, but it would have taken much longer in the absence of a monetary policy response.

We proxied the variables of monetary policy instruments to include: Money Supply (MS), Exchange Rate (ER), Interest Rate (IR), and Liquidity Ratio (LR). Economic growth was represented by Gross Domestic Product (income) at constant prices. Unit root test was conducted and all our estimating variables were stationary at first difference except the component of interest rate which shows that our model interpretation would not be spurious and a true representation of the relationships that exists between the explained and explanatory variables. Error Correction Model was introduced in our estimation in order to have a parsimonious model. From our result, two variables (money supply and exchange rate) had a positive but fairly insignificant impact on economic growth. Measures of interest rate and liquidity ratio on the other hand, had a negative but highly significant impact on economic growth which supports the assertion by Busari et al. (2002) that monetary policies are better suited when they are used in targeting inflation rather than in stimulating growth. In addition, Engle-Granger co-integration test was done and showed the existence of a long run relationship between monetary policy and economic growth in Nigeria. Finally, granger causality test was done on our variables and the results showed the existence of a uni-directional causality between money supply and economic growth, economic growth granger causing liquidity ratio and exchange rates while a bi-directional causality exists between interest and economic growth. We recommend that partial autonomy should be replaced with full autonomy for the central banks in Nigeria which is invariably subjected to government interference and its politics.

This study may be the first of its kind to examine in detail the impact of monetary policy on economic growth in Uganda, Kenya and Tanzania – using the autoregressive distributed lag (ARDL) bounds-testing approach. This study used two proxies of monetary policy, namely, money supply and interest rate, to examine this linkage. The results were found to differ from country to country and over time. The Uganda empirical results reveal that money supply has a positive impact on economic growth, both in the short run and in the long run. However, interest rate was found to have a positive impact on economic growth only in the short run. In the long run, interest rate has no significant impact on economic growth. In Kenya, both short-run and long-run empirical results support monetary policy neutrality, implying that monetary policy has no effect on economic growth – both in the short run and in the long run. The results from Tanzania also reveal no impact of monetary policy on economic growth in the long run – irrespective of the proxy used to measure monetary policy. However, the short-run results only reveal no impact of monetary policy on economic growth only when the interest rate is used as a proxy for monetary policy. When money supply is used to measure monetary policy, a negative relationship between monetary policy and economic growth is found to dominate. Overall, the study finds that monetary policy is only relevant for economic growth in Uganda and only when money supply is used as monetary policy variable.

The three major crises that China has been involved in the past 15 years (i.e., the 2008 global financial crisis, 2015 stock market crash in China, and the ongoing COVID-19 crisis) indicate that the scale of social financing, stock market performance, and the degree of financial deepening in China have great influences on financial stability. We observe supportive evidence, moreover, that both quantitative and price-based monetary policies can promote financial stability after crises in China, especially in the short term. The quantitative policy is more effective than price-based monetary policy and has become the main policy tool in China. At a time when the world economy is still suffering from the COVID-19 crisis, the quick economic recovery is an imperative task for all countries.

A comparison of the estimated model parameters suggests that, in Slovakia, the output gap is less sensitive to real interest rate movements and prices experience greater inertia. The estimated monetary policy reaction functions show Macedonia and Slovakia as inflation targeters, with Macedonia as the more conservative one, despite its officially applied exchange rate targeting regime. The differences in the estimated parameters imply differing transmission mechanisms for Macedonia and Slovakia. Consequently, the variance of domestic variables in Slovakia is most influenced by monetary policy shocks, while there is no single dominating shock explaining the volatility of Macedonia's macroeconomic variables. The exchange rate shock, the monetary policy shock and the demand shock are jointly important in determining the volatility of Macedonia's variables. The model simulations indicate that Macedonia experiences lower output gap and inflation volatility than Slovakia.

The strategic interactions among firms' pricing decisions lead to asymmetric response of prices and output to monetary shocks. The model implies asymmetries in positive versus negative monetary shocks, and the asymmetric responses are affected by the degree of real rigidity in marginal cost, the magnitude of price-adjusting costs and the market power of an individual firm. Chapter 3 studies the optimal monetary policy of a small open economy with nominal rigidities and exchange-rate sensitive collateral constraints. This model attempts to explain the observed monetary policy behaviour of emerging markets. The model implies pro-cyclical optimal monetary policy when the collateral constraint binds, and an economy with large external shocks that may favour a fixed exchange rate, which are consistent with the observed features of monetary policy used by emerging markets. The last chapter studies the transfer problem using a two-country DSGE model with nominal rigidities. The model compares the effects of a transfer under flexible and sticky wages, as well as under fixed and floating exchange rate regimes. The results are consistent with the conventional wisdom in international macroeconomics with nominal rigidities, which suggests that a flexible exchange rate can help reduce internal instability after negative shocks via exchange rate adjustment. However, the welfare analysis of this model implies the donor country is better off to maintain the gold standard instead of going to a floating exchange rate, even with nominal rigidities.",NA,"https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=eoh&AN=1142670&site=ehost-live","Poon_2009_essays",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,1696

In addition, the price level rises with great difficulties in response to a negative interest rate shock to the global liquidity aggregate. The excess of money supply has a transitory effect on the Egyptian output but it causes inflation pressures.

The asymmetric deviations from the long-term growth trend in each of the series are modeled using regime switching models and artificial neural networks. The results based on nonlinear switching time series models reveal strong evidence of business cycle asymmetries in most of the series. The results based on in-sample approximations from artificial neural networks show statistically significant evidence of asymmetries in all the series. Similar results are obtained when jackknife out-of-sample approximations from artificial neural networks are used. Thus, the study results show statistically significant evidence of asymmetries in all the series which indicates that business cycle fluctuations in the series are asymmetric, thus alike. Therefore, the impact of monetary policy shocks on the output and the other macroeconomic variables can be anticipated using nonlinear models only.

Due to EU accession augmented by the globalization process and involvement in global value chains (GVC), the international impacts are becoming progressively important for the domestic inflation dynamics and domestic variables are not sufficient to fully describe the domestic inflation dynamics. The employed methodology, Global Vector Autoregressive (GVAR) approach, allows modelling interactions and spillovers among countries, making the most of its advantages over the usual VAR models that model each economy separately and panel models, where countries are often treated as independent units. The results of the empirical analysis con-firm that the globalisation process has led to increasing the importance of international impacts on the domestic inflation dynamics. On the other hand, the results also indicate that accounting for a larger set of countries decreases the severity of the commodity price shocks and makes them less persistent. Furthermore, monetary policy acts as a buffer against adverse shocks, especially in the countries that are still not members of the euro-zone. The findings of the paper show that the analysed countries are pronouncedly heterogeneous.

The essays differ by the policy interventions that are analyzed. The first essay explores the impact of macro-prudential policy interventions on seven regional economies and housing markets in China. Surprise monetary policy inventions by the Federal Reserve are evaluated in the second essay for the effects on eight regional economies and housing markets in the US. The first essay makes three contributions to the study of regional Chinese housing markets. First, I construct a new monthly sample of regional real GDPs, real loans, and real house prices for China from February 2005 to March 2013. Two pre-determined national macro-prudential policy indexes are included in the sample. Second, a structural panel VAR-X with TVPs and TVV is estimated on this sample using Bayesian methods. Third, my results show regional house prices respond more to housing demand shocks of the coastal regions than to the shocks of the interior regions. Housing demand shocks also lower real GDPs and loans across the regions of China. Regional house prices display smaller responses to regional housing demand shocks during the 2007-2009 financial crisis compared with the rest of the sample.Macro-prudential policies have a larger impact on regional Chinese house prices than on regional real GDPs and loans. Macro-prudential policies in China appear to be more effective from 2011 to 2013 than during the 2007-2009 financial crisis. The second essay employs similar econometric tools, but applies these methods to study the transmission mechanism that disturbances in the real, financial, and housing sectors have on fluctuations in eight economic regions of the US. A structural panel VAR-X with TVPs and TVV is estimated on regional real personal income, real personal consumption expenditures, real loans, and real house prices across eight regions of the US from 1998Q2 to 2019Q3.

Second, a positive government spending shock leads to a consumption rise in the model that predicts a consumption fall based on conventional theory.

The authors focus on the housing component of the CPI to illustrate their point. They conclude that those components of the CPI that monetary policy is likely to affect have been declining in importance, meaning that to produce a given reduction in the overall rate of inflation will require that monetary policy have an increasingly larger impact on an ever-diminishing portion of the consumer basket.

We incorporate the shadow short rate in a standard vector autoregressive analysis to study the effects of monetary policy shocks both at the level of the Euro area and for two periphery EA countries, Italy and Spain, that endured significant financial stress during the crisis. Our analysis shows that monetary policy shocks identified form the SSR produce similar macro responses as shocks identified from the standard policy rate. The Euro area shocks can directly translate to a corresponding change in the country-specific financing conditions in the periphery, whereas the reverse effect is limited. The historical decomposition of the stochastic component of the SSR series shows that the unconventional policy measures were effective in stabilising the sovereign crisis in 2011, however, their relatively limited quantity provided only a weak stimulus to the economy.","10.1007/s10663-016-9328-4","https://doi.org/10.1007/s10663-016-9328-4","Damjanović_2016_shadow",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,1731

Although Bangladesh entered the regime of floating exchange rate in 2003, central bank intervenes to minimize excessive fluctuation in exchange rate through foreign exchange intervention policy. While these two policies work simultaneously, there was no study to examine the performance and effectiveness of these policies and understand their interaction in the framework of a joint analysis. The paper intends to fill up this gap. The paper develops a structural vector autoregression (SVAR) model to understand how foreign exchange intervention and conventional monetary policy affects the economy along with the endogenous reaction of policy variables. The intervention policy and conventional monetary policy are jointly analyzed to understand the interaction between them and also their impact on exchange rate and other economic variables i.e., price levels, real economic activity and real financial asset prices. The SVAR model is identified through relevant exclusion restriction based on the literature and the reality of the economy of Bangladesh. Monthly data of the relevant variables from July 2003 to December 2014 are used to estimate the model. Impulse response function is used to reveal the impact of policy and other shocks.Results reveal that foreign exchange intervention shocks have significant effects on the Taka / US $ exchange rate and the contribution of foreign exchange intervention shocks to exchange rate fluctuation is larger than that of monetary policy shocks. However, intervention shock has virtually no impact on price level, economic activity and real asset price supporting sterilization. On the other hand, while conventional monetary policy has insignificant effect on relevant variables when its effect is examined excluding foreign exchange intervention policy, it has mostly significant impact on economic variables when joint analysis is conducted. Both monetary policy variable and foreign exchange intervention variable react to each other significantly, suggesting the usefulness of this joint analysis. Results also reveal appropriate policy reaction to economic situation. Central Bank’s policy interventions are working pretty well in achieving internal and external stability of the value of local currency. Hence, present framework of exchange rate intervention and monetary policy may be continued without any major overhaul. However, monetary policy has limited impact on economic activity measured by industrial production. Hence, to the extent growth is adversely affected by inflation and exchange rate fluctuation, the central bank may work towards achieving higher growth indirectly by maintaining low inflation and exchange rate stability.",NA,"https://www.jstor.org/stable/26415729","Khan_2017_interaction",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,1735

The effectiveness of monetary policy instruments to control the level of inflation has been widely criticised not only in the South African context but also internationally. This paper assesses how inflation react to monetary policy shocks in South Africa during the inflation targeting period by making use of the structural vector error correction model (SVECM). The results of the impulse response function obtained from the SVECM show that, on average, contractionary monetary policy that intends to curb inflationary pressure has been impotent in South Africa. However, the contractionary monetary policy shocks managed to reduce output. The paper suggests that it is time a dual target, inflation and output, be considered in South Africa to avoid the harm caused on output growth from monetary policy actions related to the constraint of inflation targeting.",NA,"https://dergipark.org.tr/en/pub/ijefi/issue/32006/353620","Bonga-Bonga_2017_assessing",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,1744

Monetary and fiscal policies are tools for economists and policymakers to correctly direct the economy and facilitate the growth and development of the country. Accordingly, it is critically important for policy-makers in the area of economy to study the efficiency and the effectiveness of such policies. But, so far, there has been no generally accepted evidence suggesting the effectiveness of either the policy in Turkey or around the world. Instead, the dominance of either policy is subject to a change period to period and country to country. Purpose of the article: The purpose of this study is to analyze the growth effectiveness of fiscal and monetary policies and then determine which of these two policies is more powerful in promoting economic growth in Turkey over the period 1998 and 2016. Methods: To investigate the growth effectiveness of monetary and fiscal policies, we use some of the time series econometric techniques, such as ARDL Bounds testing, structural break unit root tests and Granger causality tests. Findings &amp; Value added: Monetary policy variable is creating only short-run effects on growth; but, it’s not causing any Granger causality on it. On the other hand, fiscal policy variable has a long-run significant effect and causing to growth. Thus, the fiscal policy seems to be more effective than monetary policy during examination period, implying the rethinking the implementation of both policies in Turkey.

The literature regarding the validity of the quantity theory within a given economy is mixed. Previous research has found support for quantity theory within a given economy by combining the P-Star, the structural VAR and the monetary aggregation literature. However, these models lack precise modelling of the short-run dynamics by ignoring interest rates as the main policy instrument. Contrarily, most New Keynesian approaches, while excellently modeling the short-run dynamics transmitted through interest rates, ignore the role of money and thus the potential mid-and long-run effects of monetary policy. We propose a parsimonious and fairly unrestrictive econometric model that allows a detailed look into the dynamics of a monetary policy shock by accounting for changes in economic equilibria, such as potential output and money demand, in a framework that allows for both monetarist and New Keynesian transmission mechanisms, while also considering the Barnett critique.

The utility specification increases households' willingness to hold housing stock and implies a relatively high sensitivity of housing investment to monetary policy. We estimate the model on Australian data and find that our model is better able to match a number of empirical regularities compared to a model without housing. These regularities include the sensitivity of housing investment to interest rates and the persistence of aggregate output's response to monetary policy shocks. We then use the model to explore the role of the housing sector in the rebalancing of the Australian economy following the end of the mining boom.

There is substantial South African literature on this topic, but much disagreement remains. Though not undisputed, there is growing consensus that monetary policy has contributed to the remarkable stabilisation of the South African economy over this period. The evaluation of the role of fiscal policy in stabilisation has been less favourable and there is little evidence that a countercyclical fiscal stance was a priority over this period. This paper considers these issues in an empirical framework that addresses some of the shortcomings in the literature. Specifically, it constructs a structural model in contrast with the reduced form models typically used in the South African literature, incorporates the dynamic interaction between monetary and fiscal shocks on the demand side and supply shocks on the other, and avoids controversy over ""neutral"" base years and the size of fiscal elasticities. The model confirms the consensus on monetary policy, finding it to have been largely countercyclical since 1994.

The extra information from sign restrictions is important for new insights regarding the transmission of monetary policy to the housing sector – notably, the results indicate that residential investment is less sensitive to a contractionary shock than standard estimates with recursive restrictions. Given that the response of the housing sector using sign restrictions is smaller than other work using standard identification methods, the work indicates that further research is needed to examine whether other sectors of the economy may be less sensitive to monetary policy than previously thought.","10.1016/j.econmod.2017.04.013","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S026499931730603X","Ume_2018_the",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,1763

With the specter of this crisis looming substantially and scarring existing monetary zones, the purpose of this paper is to complement existing literature by analyzing the effects of monetary policy on economic activity (output and prices) in the CEMAC and UEMOA CFA franc zones. Design/methodology/approach VARs within the frameworks of Vector Error-Correction Models and Granger causality models are used to estimate the long- and short-run effects, respectively. Impulse response functions are further used to assess the tendencies of significant Granger causality findings. A battery of robustness checks are also employed to ensure consistency in the specifications and results. Findings –H1. monetary policy variables affect prices in the long-run but not in the short-run in the CFA zones (broadly untrue). This invalidity is more pronounced in CEMAC (relative to all monetary policy variables) than in UEMOA (with regard to financial dynamics of activity and size). H2. monetary policy variables influence output in the short-term but not in the long-run in the CFA zones. First, the absence of cointegration among real output and the monetary policy variables in both zones confirm the neutrality of money in the long term. With the exception of overall money supply, the significant effect of money on output in the short-run is more relevant in the UEMOA zone, than in the CEMAC zone in which only financial system efficiency and financial activity are significant. Practical implications First, compared to the CEMAC region, the UEMOA zone’s monetary authority has more policy instruments for offsetting output shocks but fewer instruments for the management of short-run inflation. Second, the CEMAC region is more inclined to non-traditional policy regimes while the UEMOA zone dances more to the tune of traditional discretionary monetary policy arrangements. A wide range of policy implications are discussed. Inter alia: implications for the long-run neutrality of money and business cycles; implications for credit expansions and inflationary tendencies; implications of the findings to the ongoing debate; country-specific implications and measures of fighting surplus liquidity.

In achieving this task, the study was disaggregated into two models: model 1 utilizing Vector Error Correction Model to analyse the relationship between fiscal variables (government total expenditure, government tax revenue, and export) and unemployment rate. It was revealed from the unit root of Augmented Dickey-Fuller test that none of the (fiscal) variables was stationary at level, but they were all stationary after 1st Differencing. This made it necessary for the study to apply Johansen co-integration test which the estimated result indicated 1 co-integration equation as evidenced by Trace statistic. This also, necessitated the application of Vector Error Correction Model (VECM), and it was observed that it took 61.71% annual speed of adjustment towards long-run equilibrium from short-run disequilibrium for unemployment rate to return to equilibrium after a shock to fiscal variables. The results further explained that government total expenditure, and government tax revenue, had negative and insignificant impact on unemployment rate respectively, thereby reducing unemployment rate. Similarly, the estimated result indicated that export had positive impact on unemployment thereby increasing unemployment rate within the period under study. Similarly, in analysing monetary variables (money supply, exchange rate and prime lending rate) in model 2: Phillip-Peron unit root test was conducted and it was confirmed that the variables were of mixed order of integration which necessitated the employment of ARDL technique. The ARDL bounds testing result revealed that a long-run relationship existed between monetary variables, and inflation. It was found, in the long-run, that money supply caused inflation rate to rise. More so, the result further revealed that present level of exchange rate decelerated inflation rate in both long-run and short-run. While, it was further observed that the one-year lag and two-year lag of exchange rate increased rate of inflation in both log-run and short-run respectively. The estimated result further revealed that the present level of prime lending rate minimised the rate of inflation in the long-run and short-run. Whereas, similar results were further confirmed in the one-year lag and two-year lag that prime lending rate reduced inflation rate in both log-run and short-run.

With respect to model 2; it recommended the adoption of contractionary monetary policy that would minimise the amount of money supply that caused long-run effect on inflation in the system. Furthermore, there should be proper maintenance of fixed exchange rate policy that will make exchange rate regime overcome non-military forces of demand and supply in exchange rate market, this will help maintain low rate of inflation.","10.47672/aje.887","https://www.ajpojournals.org/journals/index.php/AJE/article/view/887","Akeerebari_2022_effect",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,1766

Whilst the finding shows a positive relationship between money supply and economic growth, it however reveals a negative relationship for both real exchange rate and inflation on growth during the study period. The short run dynamics also reveals that money supply, government revenue, government expenditure and war dummy are the main variables influencing real GDP growth in Sierra Leone.

We first contrast the response of the real economy to commodity price shocks in two periods: 1983Q2-2015Q2 and 1994Q1-2015Q2, where the beginning of the second sample coincides with a statistically identified structural break, as well as the introduction of NAFTA. The results indicate that the commodity price shocks, such as for oil and metal, have a bigger impact on the real economy after NAFTA came into force, with metal prices having a larger quantitative impact on output in comparison to oil prices. Next, we investigate whether these changes have different implications for the impact of domestic monetary shocks in the three countries. We find that while the post-NAFTA period is characterized by a stronger domestic monetary policy response to commodity price shocks, the response to monetary shocks per se varies in the two time periods. In particular U.S. monetary policy, as reflected in shocks to short-term interest rates, has a weaker influence in the post-NAFTA period.

We find that tighter monetary policy leads to a shift in firms' mix of external financing – commercial paper issuance rises while bank loans fall, suggesting that loan supply has indeed been reduced. Furthermore, these shifts in the financing mix seem to affect investment (even controlling for interest rates).

We propose a new focus: directly incorporating the underlying shocks that cause exchange rate fluctuations when evaluating how these fluctuations ""pass through"" to import and consumer prices. A standard open-economy model shows that the relationship between exchange rates and prices depends on the shocks which cause the exchange rate to move. We build on this to develop a structural Vector Autoregression (SVAR) framework for a small open economy and apply it to the UK. We show that prices respond differently to exchange rate movements based on what caused the movements. For example, exchange rate pass-through is low in response to domestic demand shocks and relatively high in response to domestic monetary policy shocks. This framework can improve our ability to estimate how pass-through can change over short periods of time. For example, it can explain why sterling's post-crisis depreciation caused a sharper increase in prices than expected, while the effect of sterling's 2013-15 appreciation was more muted.

In this essay, I aim to further our understandings of the internal workings of financial intermediaries, how they interact in financial networks, and how they affect monetary policy and the macroeconomy. In the first chapter, James Peck and I study a bank run model where the depositors can choose how much to deposit. In the many years and many published articles following the bank runs paper of Diamond and Dybvig (1983), only a few papers have modeled the decision of whether to deposit, much less the decision of how much to deposit. The questions we address here are, how does the opportunity for consumers to invest outside the banking system--in investments that do not provide liquidity insurance--(1) affect the nature of the final allocation, (2) affect the nature of the optimal deposit contract, and (3) affect the fragility of the banking system? We extend the Diamond and Dybvig (1983) model so to incorporate sequential service constraint and the opportunity of outside investments and show that under certain conditions the equilibrium entails partial deposits, thus arguing for the optimality of limited banking. One might think that when depositors are allowed to invest a fraction of their endowments outside the banking system, they would be hedging against the risk of a run occurring, but losing out on some of the services provided by banks. Thus, one might think that this would improve the stability of the financial system at the expense of lost efficiency. However, we show that the opposite could be true, with reduced stability (runs more likely) but higher efficiency! In the second chapter, I study the strategic behavior of heterogeneous banks in a network and its implications on the stability of the financial system. I construct a model alas Allen and Gale (2000) wherein banks differ in whether they are hit by an uninsurable excess liquidity demand. I show that in such a framework banks that are already facing a high liquidity demand are more likely to incur the burden of excess liquidity shocks even when that shock has not directly hit them, i.e. relatively healthier banks strategically pass liquidation costs to relatively less healthy banks. I also show that private bailouts arise endogenously in this framework. If the strategic behavior of a bank results in the other bank's failure, the first bank may choose to incur the burden of the liquidity shock by itself to let the other bank survive and, thus, to control the indirect costs of failure feeding back to its portfolio. I also show that for some economies the financial network becomes more stable as the level of cross-deposits is increased from the minimum level that fully insures banks against liquidity demand uncertainty up to a threshold level. In the third chapter, I study the role of financial intermediaries in the transmission of monetary policy in low interest rate environments. The global financial crisis not only proved our understanding of intermediaries were inaccurate and in many ways misleading but also provided an unprecedented opportunity to investigate the questions in ways that were not possible before. Among those, was the behavior of economic players in ultra-low and even negative market rates. I study the internal workings of intermediaries by exploiting geographical variation in market concentration and provide the first explanation for the gradual deterioration of monetary policy power in low market rates that does not rely on bank-specific characteristics and similarly applies to non-bank intermediaries. I show that--in stark contrast to the textbook view but consistent with my mechanism--in low market rates more concentrated banks respond to market rate falls by reducing their deposit supply as well as their loan supply by more than those of less concentrated banks. I argue this behavior is the response of banks to loan and deposit demand becoming less elastic to market rate changes in low market rates which itself is due to the shift of household assets from the ones that are fully responsive to market rate changes (e.g. money market funds) to those less responsive (e.g. deposits) or irresponsive (e.g. cash) in low market rates. As the market rate falls, The downward pressure of the increased market power and the upward pressure of the traditional channels, cause the non-monotonic response of banks to market rate changes. The results help explain the puzzling slow recovery of the economy as well as stable inflation after the global financial crisis. I also show that local house prices become less responsive to market rate changes in low market rates in the counties that are exposed to high-market-power banks.",NA,"https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=eoh&AN=2009651&site=ehost-live","Setayesh Valipour_2022_essays",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,1807

The main findings reveal that contractionary monetary policy shock significantly depresses real output for many quarters in South Africa. However, output declines insignificantly and transitorily in South Korea, indicating monetary neutrality. I attribute this difference to the transitory responses of both the monetary aggregate M2 and the exchange rate to a monetary policy shock in South Korea compared to South Africa. This implies that each country, despite targeting inflation, has a different monetary policy reaction function. Evidence shows that the monetary policy shocks explain a large portion of fluctuations in output in these emerging market economies compared to those reported for advanced countries by Uhlig (J Monet Econ 52(2):381–419, 2005) and Rafiq and Mallick (J Macroecon 30:1756–1791, 2008).

The effect of the crisis during each quarter is quantified in terms of QGDP growth rate, which is used as the context for the monetary policy response measures taken during the crises. The monetary policy measures are then evaluated by analyzing its short-term effect on prices in the economy using percentage change in QGDP deflator. Thereafter, the monetary policy response measures of the four selected countries are compared against each other.

Government consumption is unaffected by monetary policy shocks. The impact of unanticipated interest rate changes on inflation is negative and symmetric. Anticipated policy rate changes also have a negative impact on aggregate demand and its components, except for government consumption, but between certain levels, such changes are ineffective, indicating a neutral impact.

First, in accordance with Bernanke's proposal (2007), I theoretically explain the effect of restrictive monetary policy on the behavior of both banks and nonbank financial intermediaries through their balance sheet conditions, which is a medium for the two kinds of lenders to shrink their loan supply. Second, if this theoretical explanation is correct, empirically we should expect the net worth and the intermediated loans of both kinds of lending institutions to fall in response to a tight monetary shock. Employing the traditional OLS and the VAR methodology, I find that nonbank financial institutions respond by shrinking their net worth, and they subsequently reduce their loans in the same ways banks do. This evidence suggests that nonbank financial institutions may play an important role in amplifying the effect of monetary policy on output, providing some explanation of the existing puzzles. In my second essay, I provide more evidence on the behavior of small and large firms, employing the Flow of Funds data, the QFR data and other sources. The empirical test to examine behavior of small and large firms is conducted in two ways: (1) by different episodes, tight monetary policy episodes and business cycles episodes and (2) by different time periods, Pre-1990 periods and Post-1990 periods. First, I find that a monetary shock and an NBER recession shock differently affect firms' short-term financing behavior. During recent periods, after a contractionary monetary shock, large firms increase their short-term debt more than small firms, whereas after an NBER recession shock, large firms decrease most balance sheet variables (including short-term debt) more than small firms. These findings suggest that small firms are more credit-constrained after a monetary policy shock, whereas large firms are more credit-constrained after an NBER recession shock. Second, I find that, after a contractionary monetary shock, during earlier periods, large firms decrease their short-term debt less than small firms, whereas during recent periods, large firms increase more than small firms. Although these findings appear to be contradictory, they are consistent in that small firms have continued to be more credit-constrained than large firms after contractionary monetary policy--at the time when demand for loans increases.",NA,"https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=eoh&AN=1607735&site=ehost-live","Yu_2015_two",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,1821

The study recommends the need for the CBN to employ alternative monetary policy instruments aside from the interest rate in a bid to stimulate the economy in the face of productivity shocks.",NA,NA,"Asuzu_2023_analysis",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,1833

Complications to theoretical propositions tend to arise when economies are less market-oriented and less sensitive to policy interventions, when monetary authorities are not adequately independent, or when market-based and administrative policy instruments are used concurrently. It is important, therefore, to appreciate the unique dynamics of the transmission mechanism in any jurisdiction, in order to understand and possibly predict the macroeconomic effects of monetary policy. This study assessed the effects of monetary policy in Malawi by tracing the channels of its transmission mechanism, while recognizing several factors that characterize the economy: market imperfections, fiscal dominance and vulnerability to external shocks. Within the environment of vector autoregressive modelling, Granger-causality and block exogeneity tests as well as innovation accounting analyses were conducted to describe the dynamic interrelationships among monetary policy, financial variables and prices. The study established the lack of unequivocal evidence in support of a conventional channel of the monetary policy transmission mechanism, and found that the exchange rate was the most important variable in predicting prices. Therefore, the study recommends that authorities should be more concerned with imported cost-push inflation rather than demand-pull inflation. In the short term, pursuing a prudent exchange rate policy that recognizes the country’s precarious foreign reserve position could be critical in deepening domestic price stability. Beyond the short term, price stability could be sustained through the implementation of policies directed towards building a strong foreign exchange reserve base, as well as developing a sustainable approach to the country’s reliance on development assistance.",NA,"http://publication.aercafricalibrary.org/handle/123456789/518","Mangani_2020_the",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,1839

The paper shows how to construct and estimate (using regime changes) a model in which some agents form rational-expectations and others follow rules of thumb.

The SVAR approach has been developed over the last decade to interpret business cycle fluctuations and to help identify the effects of different economic policies. It is an extension on the traditional atheoretic VAR approach in that it combines economic theory with time-series analysis to determine the dynamic response of economic variables to various disturbances. The main advantage with SVAR analysis is that the necessary restrictions on the estimated reduced form model, required for identification of the underlying structural model, can be provided by economic theory. These restrictions can be either contemporaneous or long-run in nature depending on whether the underlying disturbances are considered to be temporary or permanent in nature. Once the identification is achieved it is possible to recover the structural shocks. These shocks can then be used to generate impulse response and variance decomposition functions to assess the dynamic impacts on different economic variables. In addition these functions can be used to test whether such shocks affect the economic variables as economic theory would predict so providing a check on the theory. SVAR analysis has been used internationally to examine a variety of research topics, such as asymmetric shocks from monetary union and impacts of exchange rate movements. A number of research topics in the Irish context that could benefit from SVAR analysis are identified. These topics relate mainly to areas of inflation, exchange rate and monetary policy. The SVAR is an important and useful methodology that is worthy of more attention by the Irish economics community than it currently receives.",NA,"https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=eoh&AN=1028923&site=ehost-live","McCoy_1997_how",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,1842

Theoretically, we survey the techniques of monetary control and identify the process whereby these techniques might affect the macroeconomic behavior. Theories of how to conduct the monetary policy view the latter as an economic instrument which uses money supply and interest rates as intermediate objectives to help achieve a healthy business cycle-growth in output, low unemployment and low inflation. Empirically, we identify the techniques of the monetary policy applied in Lebanon during the years 1993-2002 and analyze their impact on the macroeconomic situation. We provide evidence that neither economic growth nor unemployment reduction were considered as ultimate targets for the monetary authority in Lebanon. Since 1993, the Lebanese monetary policy has been targeted at maintaining strength and stability in the exchange rate, controlling the inflation rate, and most importantly, financing the current expenses of the public sector. Moreover, interest rates that are supposed to be consequences of the application of the monetary policy instruments were artificially manipulated by the Lebanese Government to achieve its targets. High interest rates on treasury bills discouraged private investment in the productive sectors of the Lebanese economy. Most foreign and local capital was invested in highyield government bonds rather than in high-value economic growth and employment-promoting activities. This was the major contributor to the decline in lending opportunities to the productive sectors and to the allocation of larger national resources to bondholders-the majority from wealthy and high-income classes. Monetary policy in Lebanon constituted a major obstacle to productive investment and consequently to economic growth and unemployment reduction. This study provides evidence in favor of this argument confirming that the recent economic crisis in Lebanon is the result of the bad application of the monetary policy instruments throughout the 1993-2002 period.",NA,"https://ir.ndu.edu.lb:8443/xmlui/handle/123456789/1421","Daher_2003_monetary",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,1868

Second, conditioned on adverse and monetary policy shocks, the maximum declines in output, consumption, investment and hours are significantly smaller and occur sooner than conditioned on adverse shocks only. The effect of monetary policy on hours is particularly strong. Third, output, consumption and investment return to their pre-recession levels between one and two years sooner conditioned on both adverse and monetary policy shocks than on adverse shocks only.

Government expenditure and revenue were used as the proxy variables for the fiscal policy whereas real interest rate, inflation, official exchange rate and M2 money supply were used as the proxy variables for monetary policy. Using Lin, Levin and Chu (LLC), and Im, Peresan and Shin (IPS) unit root tests, it was found that all variables were stationary at level except for M2 money supply which was found to be stationary after first difference. Due to this, Panel Auto Regression Distributed Lags (PARDL) estimation technique was utilized in this study. Pooled Mean Group (PMG) PARDL model estimator was used in this study. The results indicate that fiscal and monetary policy influence economic growth significantly in the long run. However, fiscal policy is only significant if government expenditure is used as the functional policy instrument rather than government revenue. In the short run, the effects of these two macroeconomic policies on economic growth are mixed. Granger causality results indicate that the direction government expenditure, real interest rate, inflation and official exchange rate Granger cause economic growth. These causality links are uni-directional in nature. Lastly, the results also indicate that private investment is crowded out in the long run because of significant high levels of government expenditure in the long run across SACU member economies. In the short run, private investment is crowded out because of significant high level of government expenditure only in Swaziland. As some of the recommendations of this study, SACU member governments should redirect their public expenditures into investing more in human capital. Investing in human capital, among other factors can include empowering the active unemployed population with relevant skills that meet labor markets for easy employment. In that case, the tax revenues would increase which could play an important role in reducing government budget deficits. Furthermore, SACU member economies’ central banks can make monetary policy more effective by using monetary accommodation. Hence, when the governments apply expansionary fiscal policy, the central banks can increase money supply to avoid interest rates from increasing (monetizing budget deficit).",NA,"https://repository.nwu.ac.za/handle/10394/40027","Monamodi_2019_the",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,1876

Our objective is to determine whether adding to or replacing the policy instrument can preserve linearity or whether one must allow structural breaks. We include data for both normal and unconventional periods and find that shadow rates preserve linearity better than using a bounded federal funds rate alone, adding the balance sheet, or adding long rates.

Yet, empirical studies of monetary policy have typically found exchange rate effects that are inconsistent with overshooting. This puzzling result has been viewed by some researchers as a “stylized fact” to be reckoned with in policy modelling. However, many of these studies, in particular those using vector autoregressive (VARs) approaches, have disregarded the strong contemporaneous interaction between monetary policy and exchange rate movements by placing zero restrictions on them. In contrast, we achieve identification by imposing a long-run neutrality restriction on the real exchange rate, thereby allowing for contemporaneous interaction between the interest rate and the exchange rate. In a study of four open economies, we find that the puzzles disappear. In particular, a contractionary monetary policy shock has a strong effect on the exchange rate, which appreciates on impact. The maximum effect occurs within 1–2 quarters, and the exchange rate thereafter gradually depreciates to baseline, consistent with the Dornbusch overshooting hypothesis and with few exceptions consistent with uncovered interest parity (UIP).","10.1016/j.jinteco.2009.06.003","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022199609000841","Bjørnland_2009_monetary",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,1913

The first essay compares two broad approaches to identifying the monetary policy shocks that are used to estimate the regional effects of monetary policy. One approach that has been used in the previous literature assumes that monetary policymakers respond to shocks to regional personal income but do not respond directly to shocks to national income. A second general approach assumes that monetary policymakers respond to shocks to national income but do not respond directly to region-specific income shocks. This assumption is based on descriptions of monetary policymaking that policymakers focus on the national economy and use regional information as a gauge to measure the national economy. The results show that the effects of monetary policy shocks on regional income differ across the two broad approaches to identifying policy shocks. Therefore, assumptions about whether monetary policymakers respond directly to regional shocks seem to matter for estimating the regional effects of monetary policy. In the second essay, the analysis of the effects of monetary policy is extended to the state level. Using the same methods as in the first essay, we investigate whether responses of statelevel income to monetary policy differ from one state to another, whether responses of state-level income differ from the region’s overall response, and whether the method of identifying policy shocks matters. Comparisons of states’ responses to monetary policy shocks show that each state’s response is sometimes quite different from the response of the other states in that region and from the overall response of its region.

Recursive estimates of coefficient on lagged inflation and Chow parameter stability tests confirm these results. Second, inflation response to systematic monetary policy actions is examined. Results suggest that inflation is more persistent and monetary policy is more accommodative in the flexible exchange rate regime. However, the correlation between money growth and inflation is found to be modest. Finally, inflation response to non-systemic policy actions (i.e., policy shocks) is examined through impulse response functions of an unrestricted VAR system. Results suggest that policy shocks are more persistent in the flexible exchange rate regime, than in the fixed exchange rate regime. However, maximum lag length of inflation response to a policy shock is not significantly different across regimes, suggesting that results from the impulse response analysis are inconclusive. Overall, there is substantial evidence to suggest that the shift in inflation persistence coincides with the change in exchange rate regimes. Moreover, during the flexible regime, higher monetary accommodation has resulted in higher inflation persistence. Because of sluggish response of inflation to changes in monetary policy measures, more stringent monetary policy measures may be needed to curb inflationary pressures.","10.4038/ss.v37i1.1227","https://ss.sljol.info/article/10.4038/ss.v37i1.1227/","Harischandra_2009_monetary",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,1926

The analysis proceeds in three stages. First, industry price and output responses to unanticipated changes in the federal funds rate are examined. Second, the effect of industry characteristics on these responses is analyzed. Finally, the paper assesses whether particular industry characteristics are associated with price rigidity or interest rate sensitivity. The results in this paper support the following conclusions. Durable good industries exhibit larger price and output responses to federal funds rate shocks than nondurable good industries. This suggests that durable good industries are more sensitive to interest rate shocks than nondurable good industries and is consistent with the observation that durable good industries are more cyclical than nondurable good industries. High concentration industries are found to exhibit smaller price responses and larger output responses to unanticipated changes in the federal funds rate than low concentration industries. Thus, price rigidity may be an important determinant of how high concentration industries respond to federal fund rate shocks. Industries with high inventory-to-sales ratios are associated with smaller price and output responses to interest rate shocks than industries with low inventory-to-sales ratios.

Vast changes in exchange rates can affect the country's macroeconomic variables by affecting the supply and demand of the economy. Thus, according to the proposed issues, this study intends to use the 18-year experience of inflation targeting framework adopted by industrial and developing countries so as to investigate the relationship between monetary shocks on the real exchange rate and the trade balance in some of these countries.

The empirical findings based on monthly data relating to the post-liberalisation period (April 1992-December 2012) suggest that contractionary monetary policy has had a considerable adverse impact on output for a year, which appears to be consistent with the prevailing economic outlook. But the same policy measure fuels inflation further for the first eight months in contrast to its expected decline, and the rise in inflation raises the issue of a 'price puzzle' in the Indian context. Monetary policy-induced exchange rate appreciation hampers industrial production due to outperformance of high import demand over export competitiveness and causes an increase in the average price level. Global factors like oil price shocks leave detrimental effects on output for a long time horizon of 10-12 months and raise inflation for nearly half a year, whereas an increase in the US federal funds rate results in a temporary decline in output growth of Indian industries.","10.1177/0973801014544580","https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=eoh&AN=1478267&site=ehost-live","Paramanik_2014_a",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,1950

Central banks have recently engaged in unconventional monetary policies at the zero lower bound, where their forecasts play a crucial role in signaling the future path of monetary policy. The work presented herein investigates the effect of monetary policy announcements at the zero lower bound in Japan, and evaluates the efficiency of forecasts that are explicitly tied to monetary policy decisions in the United States. The first chapter investigates the effects of monetary policy announcements at the zero lower bound using Japanese data from 1998 to 2013. I find that the effect of expansionary monetary policy shocks is directly passed on to corporate bond yields, notably for high-grade corporate bond yields. However, the magnitude of estimated pass-through to stock prices and the exchange rate is substantially smaller than in the U.S., and not statistically significant in most cases. Such differences may reflect a higher degree of market segmentation or smaller scope to achieve further accommodation in Japan. The second chapter evaluates the efficiency of the FOMC's new economic projections. Since 2007, FOMC policymakers have been publishing detailed numerical projections of macroeconomic series over the next three years. By testing whether the revisions to these projections are unpredictable, I find that FOMC's efficiency is generally accepted for inflation, but often rejected for real economic variables, notably for the unemployment rate. The rejection is due to the strong autocorrelation of revisions, which may reflect information rigidity of FOMC's unemployment projections. The joint efficiency of the entire projection is accepted in most cases. The third chapter evaluates the efficiency of Fed's Greenbook forecast and uses this evaluation to improve the accuracy of the Greenbook forecast. Recently, Patton and Timmermann (2012) proposed a more powerful kind of forecast efficiency regression at multiple horizons, and showed that it provides evidence against the efficiency of the Fed's Greenbook forecasts. I use their forecast efficiency evaluation to propose a method for adjusting the Greenbook forecasts. Using this method in a real-time out-of-sample forecasting exercise, I find that it gives modest improvements in the accuracy of the forecasts for GDP deflator and CPI, but not for other variables. The improvements are statistically significant in some cases, the magnitude of which can be as high as an 18 percent reduction in the root mean square prediction error.",NA,"https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=eoh&AN=1537545&site=ehost-live","Arai_2015_essays",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,1955

While tightening the MPR had positive, elastic and statistically significant effect on unemployment, implying complete pass-through, easing the MPR had negative, inelastic and statistically insignificant effect on unemployment, suggesting incomplete pass-through. Similarly, the short-run effects of tightening or easing the MPR were dissimilar. Furthermore, the result of the cumulative multiplier indicated that the cumulative effects of tightening the MPR on unemployment dominated the cumulative effects of easing the MPR on unemployment in Nigeria. It is therefore recommended that to curb unemployment using the interest rate channel, the monetary authority (Monetary Policy Committee) should ease the MPR by a higher magnitude compared to the magnitude that is required to tighten it for the purpose of price stability.",NA,NA,"G.

The paper employs OLS methodology with all the BLUE assumption. The results show that considering the magnitude, 1% increase in RGDP (proxy for economic growth) is brought about by 0.86% increase in narrow money supply (M1), 0.63% increase in broad money supply (M2), 258% decrease in inflation rate (INFLARATE), 1276.3% increase in lending rate (LEDRATE), and 143.9% increase in gross fixed capital formation. This implies that an increase in lending rate and other related variables will lead to a significant increase in real GDP, proxy for economic growth in Nigeria. The estimated value of R2 (goodness of fit) of 0.67 or 67% shows that 67% systematic variation in Real GDP is caused by variation in narrow money supply, broad money supply, inflation rate, lending rate, and gross fixed capital formation. This indicates that indeed, monetary policy has an effect on macroeconomic stability in Nigeria.

These kinds of VAR models assume asymmetry as a short-run relationship between the series since the long-run neutrality hypothesis of money states that monetary policy can only affect productive capacity of the economy in the short run, but not in the long run. The recent theoretical literature shows that this hypothesis is not quite right. Thus, this paper examines the extent to which monetary policy has a long-run asymmetric effect on output in a number of Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development countries by using a nonlinear hidden cointegration analysis within a likelihood-based panel framework. The findings indicate that there is a long-run relationship between the real interest rate as an indicator of monetary policy and the growth rate of real output in five countries out of nine under review. This gives support for the view that output has responded asymmetrically to the real interest rate changes.

We document that there is a large heterogeneity across sectors in the reaction to monetary policy shocks and show that sectors with larger volatility of idiosyncratic shocks react more readily to monetary policy. This finding stands in contrast to the rational inattention model of price setting. We also find that sectors, which change prices infrequently, react less strongly but if they do change their prices, they adjust them by a large amount. This suggests that the source of sluggish response to aggregate shocks is heterogeneity in menu costs rather than rational inattention. Furthermore, even though prices respond with a significant delay to identified monetary policy shocks, we find no evidence of a price puzzle on average.

The first chapter revisits the Roaring Twenties (1920s) to investigate how shocks to credit supply originating from the financial sector interacted with stock prices and macroeconomic fluctuations, and how effective was monetary policy aimed at credit stabilization. I find that financial factors were an important determinant of real output, and monetary policy contraction implied a relevant output/price level loss while not sufficient to stabilize credit and stock prices growth. Besides, the existence of a channel between credit supply in the form of brokers' loans and the level of stock prices is confirmed. The second chapter studies how bank capital relates to credit growth during periods of financial distress. I propose an econometric approach which considers portfolio adjustment strategies as discrete choices made by the bankers. Using this framework, I analyze the 1990s ""credit crunch'' and find evidence that the contraction in lending was probably not driven by the adoption of risk-based capital requirements, as part of the Basel Accord. Banks were more likely recovering from negative shocks to capital, constrained by leverage ratio requirements, and reacting to the negative economic environment. The third chapter studies the effects of bank capital regulation in credit origination by investigating the introduction of the Basel III Leverage Ratio. I find that banks affected by the Supplementary Leverage Ratio (SLR) requirement, finalized in 2014, reacted by increasing risk-taking and interest rates on mortgages. There is evidence of heterogeneous effects of policy, in which borrowers of higher risk are more affected. In addition, the aggregate increase in credit supply resulting from the adjustment is correlated with higher future home prices at the local level. The findings carry implications for the revision of post-crisis bank regulation. They indicate that a raise in bank leverage limits can coexist with the expansion of credit conditions, contradicting common claims of the banking industry against this form of capital requirement.",NA,"https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=eoh&AN=1936188&site=ehost-live","Marodin_2021_essays",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,2000

If an increase in expected future inflation is mainly due to supply shocks, the South African Reserve Bank should not apply contractionary policy to fight inflation, as this would lead to a persistent increase in inflation and a greater loss in output.

The results show that all the countries share a weak domestic credit channel while they are highly heterogeneous with regards to the relative effectiveness of the interest rate and exchange rate channels. Thus, Hungary and Poland's distinctive feature is the presence of a price puzzle effect combined with a high influence of the exchange rate which acts both as a mechanism of monetary policy transmission and as a supply and demand shock absorber. On the contrary, just like in the case of the Euro zone countries, it is the interest rate channel that has the major influence in the case of the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Slovenia and partially Romania.

Both simple theory and empirical evidence suggest that the crucial factor is the extent to which systematic monetary policy succeeds in preventing a unit root in inflation. The mechanism by which it does this appears however to be complicated by strong empirical evidence that nominal as well as real interest rates have real effects, which implies that monetary policy need not be so vigorous in reactions to inflation. This helps to explain why inflation rates in the US and (especially) Germany have been relatively predictable, despite monetary policy rules which appear to have been barely stabilising. The paper also presents tentative evidence that the power of nominal interest rate effects is inversely related to long–horizon inflation uncertainty, and hence ultimately uncertainty about monetary policy.","10.1111/1467-9485.00221","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/1467-9485.00221","Wright_2002_monetary",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,2022

Demand- and supply-side constraints are both relevant. On the supply side, price flexibility may be the result of structural and/or institutional constraints that warrant a larger degree of price adjustment in the face of demand fluctuations. On the demand side, structural constraints may hinder the transmission mechanism of demand fluctuations, resulting in an inelastic aggregate demand in the face of policy adjustments. Using data for 50 developing countries, supply-side constraints do not differentiate the transmission mechanism of policy shocks to price inflation and output growth. In contrast, a larger demand shift in the face of monetary and government spending shocks increases the real and inflationary effects of policy shocks. The pronounced evidence of upward price flexibility points to the importance of addressing supply-side capacity constraints to counter inflationary pressures in developing countries. Equally important is to analyse determinants of private spending to identify channels for influencing aggregate spending and maximizing the effectiveness of stabilization policies.",NA,"https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=eoh&AN=0867757&site=ehost-live","Kandil_2006_on",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,2032

For this purpose, the study uses vector auto-regression (VAR) model comprising output, inflation, interest rates and a banking sector stability index for a period 1995:Q2 to 2012:Q3. The banking stability index is constructed with capital adequacy, asset quality, management efficiency, earnings and liquidity (CAMEL) indicators. The paper finds that financial stability on the one hand and macroeconomic indicators comprising output, inflation and interest rates on the other hand can share a statistically significant bi-directional Granger block causal relationship. The impulse response function of the VAR model provides some interesting perspectives. First, financial stability, growth and inflation could share a medium-longer-term relationship. Second, enhanced financial stability could be associated with higher growth accompanied by softer interest rates without much threat to price stability in the medium to long term. Third, greater economic stability or higher output growth can enhance financial stability. Fourth, higher inflation or price instability could adversely affect financial stability. Fifth, financial stability can contribute to the effectiveness of monetary transmission mechanisms. Finally, the paper finds that with financial stability, output growth could become more persistent and inflation less persistent.",NA,NA,"Dhal_2011_financial",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,2045

It consists of three chapters: Chapter 1 revisits the definition of monetary policy autonomy and develops a new method to identify autonomy regimes for a set of countries. Compared to the traditional identification approach, which only focuses on correlations with the base country interest rate, monetary policy autonomy discussed in this paper is jointly determined by how the domestic interest rate responds to the foreign monetary policy as well as its domestic inflation and real GDP. Using a Bayesian Markov Switching model for the monetary policy function, I estimate policy responses in two regimes, and obtain measures of monetary policy autonomy in the estimation process. Testing the method with case studies and simulated data demonstrates the robustness of the approach under different scenarios. Applying the method to the data of a set of advanced countries, I find monetary policy autonomy decreases when the exchange rate is fixed or capital controls are loosened, which is consistent with the open economy trilemma. Chapter 2 extends the discussion in chapter 1. When using a Markov switching model to identify monetary policy autonomy, one question that needs to be addressed is: Given the limited number of observations, how well does the method actually work? By changing parameters in the data generating processes, this paper conducts simulation exercises under different scenarios. Results indicate that, in order to properly identify high and low autonomy, a larger variance in the error term requires greater differences between switching parameters in the two states. In practice, regime classification therefore can be polluted by large variances. To better identify the monetary policy autonomy regime, I adopt the regime switching model introduced by Kaufmann (2015) and show that incorporating endogenous switching could help to improve estimations. Chapter 3 studies monetary policy with a fixed exchange rate regime. Based on the study of Posch (2007), strong evidence of Jumps has been found in industrial production series. Instead of focusing on structural general equilibrium models, this paper incorporates jump process into a Vector Autoregression model and applies it to evaluate monetary policy effects in a fixed exchange rate regime. As with outliers in industrial production data, financial variables in a country with a fixed exchange rate regime also present non-normality. One of the reasons is that pegs with no capital controls are fragile to speculative attacks. An attack can result in an abrupt increase in either the interest rate or the exchange rate. Given that the outliers in the data may bias the estimation, we use the jump component to model and separate outliers from the underlying dynamic system. Based on the case study of Denmark, the traditional VAR model indicates that impacts of a monetary policy shock on domestic variables are weak. After controlling for outliers, it indicates that a contractionary monetary policy shock has significant negative impacts on both industrial production and CPI. Meanwhile, its impacts on the exchange rate are also discussed in the paper.",NA,"https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=eoh&AN=1747698&site=ehost-live","Zhou_2017_essays",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,2051

Such an approach fits better with the volatile nature of emerging market economies by allowing us to track down the time-varying effects of macroeconomic dynamics on both the model-consistent risk premium and the other key variables.

Monetary policy shock is identified by the sign restriction methodology. Unlike previous studies, this paper identifies a monetary contraction by a combination of an increase in interest rates, a decrease in central bank credit, a drop in the stock of foreign exchange reserves, and a fall in broad money. The empirical results show that output and prices begin to reduce after a restrictive monetary shock in the medium term, suggesting the adverse effect of monetary policy in the short term and the necessity to improve the transparency of monetary setting. Meanwhile, exchange rates are unresponsive to a tightening decision, which is not a sign of puzzle but plausible when the nature of a peg regime is taken into account. Furthermore, foreign exchange policy causes inflation to rise since its effect is partially sterilized by changes in monetary policy instruments. Therefore, Vietnamese monetary authorities should consider a shift toward a more floating regime to achieve monetary independence or foster the development of financial markets in order to alleviate inflationary pressure caused by foreign exchange policy.",NA,NA,"Trung_NA_monetary",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,2066

Against this backdrop, this study aims to analyse the differential impact of monetary policy on aggregate demand, aggregate supply and their components along with the general price level in India. Design/methodology/approach: The study develops a structural macroeconometric model, which is primarily aggregate and eclectic in nature. The generalized method of movements is used for estimation of behavioural equations, while a Gauss-Seidel algorithm is used for model simulation purposes. Findings: The paper presents the results of two policy simulations from the estimated model that highlight the differential impact of monetary policy. The first one, hike in the policy rate by 5% and second is a reduction in bank credit to the commercial sector by 10%. The results from the first policy simulation experiment reveal that interest hike has a significant negative impact on aggregate demand, aggregate supply and general price level. However, the maximum impact is borne by investment demand and imports followed by private consumption. While as among the components of aggregate supply maximum impact is born by infrastructure output followed by the manufacturing and services sector with the agriculture sector found to be insensitive in nature. The results from the second policy simulation experiment revealed that pure monetary shocks have a significant negative impact on aggregate demand, aggregate supply and general price level. However, the maximum impact is born by private consumption and imports followed by investment demand. While as among components of aggregate supply maximum impact is borne by infrastructure followed by the manufacturing and services sector with the agriculture sector found to be insensitive in nature. From both policy simulation experiments, the study highlighted the relative importance of the income absorption approach as opposed to the expenditure switching effect.","10.1108/JEFAS-05-2019-0072","https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=eoh&AN=1914471&site=ehost-live","Bhat_2020_examining",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,2069

The results from the equation estimated through 1980 are used to examine the behavior of inflation during the 1981-82 recession, and to predict the behavior of inflation and unemployment that would ac-company alternative paths of nominal GNP growth after 1982.The role of velocity is examined in a new set of multivariate exogeneity tests using the vector-autoregressive (VAR) approach for three separate sample periods (1953-61, 1962-70, and 1971-79).The major conclusions are that the monetary base has no significant explanatory role for spending changes.

New Keynesian models supplement older DSGE or ""real business cycle"" models with such ""old Keynesian"" features as imperfect competition and price stickiness using menu costs or stochastic price rigidity, allowing a larger role for monetary shocks to affect the real economy. The first paper, ""Forecasting output and inflation with a Bayesian VAR using a New Keynesian prior,"" examines the forecasting performance of a simple New Keynesian DSGE model. The DSGE model can be used to calculate a prior mean and covariance matrix for the coefficients of a VAR forecasting model for output, inflation and interest rates, using Ingram and Whiteman's (1994) technique for using DSGE models to calculate priors for Bayesian vector autoregression (BVAR) forecasting models. The resulting BVAR generates forecasts of inflation competitive with those from a BVAR with an atheoretical prior. However, the New Keynesian BVAR results in very poor output forecasts, particularly in the short run, suggesting some source of misspecification in the New Keynesian DSGE model. The second paper, ""Loss-based evaluation of a New Keynesian DSGE model,"" evaluates and compares the in-sample specification of a simple New Keynesian DSGE model to a cash-in-advance model without price stickiness and to an identified classical VAR, in a manner similar to Schorfheide's (2000) study of the portfolio adjustment cost model. By calculating Bayes factors and posterior probabilities for each model, one can construct a benchmark distribution for correlations and impulse response functions to which one can compare the correlations and impulse responses of the DSGE models, according to a variety of loss functions. The paper finds that very different levels of price stickiness are compatible with the data, making use of outside prior information crucial in assessing the role of the Phillips curve and of ""supply-side"" and ""demand-side"" shocks in business cycles. This point is further underlined in the third paper, ""Technology shocks versus monetary shocks: Identifying sources of business cycle fluctuations with a New Keynesian DSGE Model."" This time, the model is a three-variable New Keynesian DSGE model of output, inflation and interest rates, including habit formation in preferences as well as stochastic price rigidity. Following recent papers such as that of Smets and Wouters (2002), the paper estimates the three-variable DSGE model with Bayesian methods similar to those used in the previous paper. It goes on to report Bayes factors for the DSGE model along with several Bayesian VAR models, and find the DSGE model competitive with a four-lag BVAR. The model is used to estimate series for monetary shocks, technology/supply shocks, and autonomous demand shocks for the United States since 1965. The paper finds that monetary policy shocks have probably been of only secondary importance, as compared to that of supply shocks, in movements in US inflation, as well as output, since 1965.",NA,"https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=eoh&AN=0801959&site=ehost-live","Corrigan_2004_three",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,2085

In the first chapter, I focus on the interplay between the housing and labor market. To do so, I construct a model of search and bargaining across two different markets: the labor market and the housing market. The model highlights that housing prices and frictions in the housing market have a profound impact on labor market activity through the desire of workers to eventually purchase a home, the ""American Dream."" The model also reveals that labor market frictions can impact housing market activity. I also perform a calibration exercise to evaluate economic activity in general equilibrium. I find that frictions in the housing market generate strong negative external effects on the labor market. More specifically, a tighter housing market is associated with higher unemployment rates and less job creation. Consequently, my findings suggest that policymakers should be very careful in implementing policies targeted towards housing -- housing markets are likely to generate significant external effects to other sectors of the economy, especially the labor market. To study the effects of monetary policy on housing market activity I develop an overlapping generations model in which housing is traded across generations of individuals. Incomplete information leads to a transactions role for money so that monetary policy can be effectively studied. Moreover, individuals face liquidity risk which interferes with their ability to accumulate housing wealth. Contrary to the existing literature, I demonstrate that it is important to disaggregate fixed investment between the residential and non-residential sectors. In particular, I find the effects of monetary policy are asymmetric across the components of the overall capital stock. I conclude this chapter with a policy experiment studying how optimal monetary policy depends on housing market fundamentals. In response to adverse supply conditions in the housing sector, monetary policy should be more aggressive in order to promote residential investment and the housing stock. However, monetary policy should be conservative in order to limit exposure to risk if fundamentals favor housing demand. The third chapter is an empirical look at the relationship between monetary policy and housing market activity. I analyze and quantify the effects of monetary policy on residential investment, housing starts, new private housing permits and new single family houses sold. To conduct the analysis I estimate a vector autoregression model (VAR) where the monetary policy shock is identified using sign restrictions. No restrictions are imposed on the variables of interest, however, in response to a monetary policy shock I impose sign restrictions on the impulse responses of price, output, reserves and the federal funds rate. I find that a contractionary monetary policy shock reduces housing market activity for up to a year after the shock. Interestingly, 2 to 3 years after the economy contracts, activity in the housing sector reverses course. The findings suggest that once the economy contracts the Federal Reserve Bank reverses course by lowering the federal funds rate, and this policy reversal stimulates housing market activity.",NA,"https://ir.ua.edu/handle/123456789/1991","Ume_2014_essays",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,2090

This is important in light of the fact that the true lag structure is generally not known. Four commonly used identification schemes are employed to identify monetary policy shocks. Monte Carlo simulations strongly indicate that the lag structure of a VAR model does matter when assessing the quantitative effects of monetary policy shocks. Given the inherent uncertainty about the true lag structure in practice, it is thus important that one compare the impulse response functions from both symmetric lag and asymmetric lag VARs in assessing the effects of monetary policy shocks.","10.1080/0003684032000090663","https://doi.org/10.1080/0003684032000090663","Kim_2003_estimating",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,2095

The U.S. economy did not experience any recession or significant inflationary regimes after 1991. One of the potential explanations for this phenomenon is better monetary policy. My dissertation focuses on identifying the elements of change in monetary policy and their implications. q Why Were Changes in the Federal Funds Rate Smaller in the 1990s? (Job market paper) The federal funds rate has been the key monetary policy variable in the last two decades. The standard deviation of the first difference of the funds rate dropped by half in the 1990s. This resulted in smoother dynamics of the funds rate than before. This paper provides a detailed analysis of the above statistical property by decomposing the actual funds rate into a desired rate and a white noise term. The results indicate two primary reasons for the above observation. One, the steady-state probability of a static desired rate went up significantly in the 1990s. Two, there was a considerable fall in the variance of the change in the desired rate. The noise term in the actual funds rate did not contribute significantly. The results also show that the fall in the variance was not due to a less aggressive Fed; in fact, it was more aggressive than before. Moreover, the Fed paid more attention to the forward-looking variables than before. q Persistence in Output Gap: The Role of Inflation One of the biggest debates in the business cycle literature is how big and persistent are output gaps. Traditional detrending methods such as deterministic time trends or unobserved components models yield big and very persistent cycles. However, a univariate Beveridge-Nelson decomposition or an unobserved components model with generalized covariance structure yield short, less persistent cycles. The aim of the paper is to find out how much of the persistence of the cycles is implied by inflation. A bivariate unobserved components model of inflation and output with a generalized covariance structure increases the persistence of the cycles significantly. We constructed monetary policy shocks following Bernanke-Mihov (1998), oil price shocks, and measures of monetary policy to examine the importance of each in explaining business cycles. The results indicate each of them is significantly important even in the presence of other variables. The results also show interest rate changes do a better job of explaining the cycles than do monetary aggregates. q Explaining Long Phases of Static Federal Funds Target Rates in the 1990s (Work in progress) The federal funds target rate had long phases of no movement in the 1990s. We ask whether this observed property was due to extra cautiousness on the Fed's part. We use an autoregressive conditional hazard model (Hamilton and Jorda, 2000) for the empirical analysis. Preliminary investigations suggest that the Fed did not significantly increase its threshold level of changes in the fundamentals for a change in the target rate. The variations in the fundamentals were much lower in the 1990s and often did not exceed the threshold. This result considerably weakens the explanation of a cautious Fed in the 1990s due to parametric uncertainty.",NA,"https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=eoh&AN=0622059&site=ehost-live","Basistha_2002_essays",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,2097

We then exploit changes in monetary policy to examine whether the pass-through of borrowing costs is affected by market structure. First, we use as an experiment the announcement of the ECB Outright Monetary Transactions (OMT) program in a triple-differences specification.

I examined three topics under this theme: lending relationships between bank loan officers and firms with the possibility of collusion, the effects of the distribution of heterogeneous agents on equilibrium prices and economic growth, and the empirical evidence of effect of financial intermediation shocks on output growth fluctuations. Chapter one analyzes how lending relationships between firms and bank loan officers and the possibility of collusion affect the bank's expected return. A long-term relationship between the firm and the bank loan officer increases the probability of correct signals observed by the bank loan officer, but this improvement in monitoring quality cannot be replicated by other people, so that the long-term loan officer will not always be detected when he colludes with the firm. This tradeoff between improved monitoring quality and lower probability of being caught implies that the long-term loan officer is more likely to collude in equilibrium than the short-term loan officer given other things equal. Whether the bank should choose a long-term or a short-term loan officer is also discussed. Chapter two analyzes how the distribution of heterogeneous agents affects the equilibrium prices and growth rate in an overlapping-generations model with occupational choice. Each agent can choose to be workers or entrepreneurs. They are different in terms of their managerial ability of the production process if they become entrepreneurs. For a given distribution, a decrease in the number of entrepreneurs may increase the growth rate since the average managerial ability of the remaining entrepreneurs is higher. For a given family of distributions, I show the change of distribution parameters has important effects on the results of the model. I also differentiate between production and banking technologies and analyze their effects on prices and growth. Chapter three studies the relationship between financial shocks and output fluctuations empirically. Specifically, I want to see how financial shocks affect the short-run output growth fluctuations. Using the structural VAR framework, I identify the structural financial shocks from the fiscal, monetary and technological shocks. After the financial intermediation shocks are identified, I use impulse response and variance decomposition to analyze the contribution of financial shocks to the total variation in output growth rate.

In this regard, it is very important to investigate the role of financial systems development as the main infrastructure for the implementation of monetary policy and the realization of predetermined policy goals. In this study, considering the policy goal of reducing unemployment, the impact of financial development on the effectiveness of monetary policy is examined. For this purpose, by emphasizing the two instruments of interest rate and monetary base, in the first step, the effectiveness of monetary policy on reducing unemployment in terms of each instrument is estimate, separately and in the form of Autoregressive Distributed Lags (ARDL) Model for 1989: 1 to 2016: 4 In Iran, and then using rolling regression models, the effectiveness of each monetary policy is extracted over time. In the final step, the relationship between the estimated effectiveness and the financial development index is estimated. The results show that the development of financial institutions and markets has a diminishing effect on the effectiveness of monetary policy using interest rate tools to achieve the goal of reducing unemployment, but this diminishing effect on the effectiveness of monetary policy using the monetary base is significant only for the development of financial institutions.",NA,NA,"Seraj_NA_study",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,2108

This complex process is known as the monetary transmission mechanism and the transmission process of monetary impulses changes over time. The strength of this impact is a staple subject of economic research.Research purpose: The aim of the article is to assess the effectiveness of the Federal Reserve System’s monetary policy transmission mechanism over the period 1962–2018. In particular, the scale and timing of the interest rate pass-through to economic activity have been examined.Methods: Econometric methods (the vector autoregression model) have been used. The empirical analysis was carried out based on U.S. economic statistics for the years 1962–2018, which were taken from the FRED and BEA Databases.1Conclusions: Empirical findings reveal that the way in which the Federal Reserve System’s monetary policy influenced the U.S. economy was diversified at particular time intervals. The results imply that the effectiveness of the U.S. central bank’s interest rate policy has been decreasing since the mid-1980s. Firstly, in the period 1962–1983, the real GDP growth rate and the inflation rate were more sensitive to changes in the federal funds rate than in the period 1984–2018. Secondly, in the period 1962–1983, the effective federal funds rate had an almost threefold greater impact on economic activity and price processes. Thirdly, until the mid-1980s, the effects of monetary impulses were felt longer in the American economy than in the later period. What is more, there is no evidence to suggest that the period of historically low interest rates caused a decline in the effectiveness of the transmission of monetary policy impulses.",NA,"https://www.ceeol.com/search/article-detail?id=990378","Bró_2020_the",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,2109

However, answering questions of economic interest often requires knowing the effects of a 'unit' shock. For example, central bankers want to answer questions like 'what are the effects of a 100 basis point increase in the policy rate?' The problem is that set-identifying restrictions do not always rule out the possibility that a variable does not react contemporaneously to its own shock. As a consequence, identified sets for the impulse responses to unit shocks may be unbounded, which implies that set-identifying restrictions may be extremely uninformative. Simply assuming that responses are non-zero turns out to be an arbitrary and unsatisfactory solution. I argue that it is therefore important to communicate about the extent to which the identified set may be unbounded, since this tells us about the informativeness of the identifying restrictions, and I develop tools to facilitate this. I explain how to draw useful posterior inferences about impulse responses when identified sets are unbounded with positive probability. I illustrate the empirical relevance of these issues by estimating the response of US output to a 100 basis point federal funds rate shock under different sets of identifying restrictions. Some restrictions are very uninformative about the effects of a 100 basis point shock. The output responses I obtain under a rich set of identifying restrictions lie towards the smaller end of the range of existing estimates.",NA,"https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=eoh&AN=2014992&site=ehost-live","Read_2022_the",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,2110

The method considers multiple posteriors for the set-identified models and combines them with a single posterior for models that are either point-identified or that impose nondogmatic assumptions.

Chapter 1 focuses on identifying whether common monetary policy shocks conducted by the European Central Bank (ECB) have effects on national unemployment rates in the member-states of the European Monetary Union (EMU), and how heterogenous the effects are.1 Chapter 2 examines the extent to which the effects of shocks on unemployment are intermediated by various labor market institutions associated with each of the EA national economies. Chapter 3 looks at gender unemployment differences, asking whether an adverse shock leads to a larger increase in the unemployment rate for females relative to males, taking into account the role of labor market institutions.",NA,NA,"Wang_NA_effects",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,2129

To this end, the methodology is based on the estimation of a structural vector autoregressive model for the period 2007:Q1–2018:Q4, using four variables: EONIA, the total amount of assets on the ECB's balance sheet, the Eurozone inflation rate and the Eurozone economic growth rate. The results show a slight impact of the different balance sheet policies on inflation and economic activity behaviour, especially during the last year of the financial crisis. The robustness of these results is supported by the estimation of the same model replacing EONIA rates with shadow rates.

The effects of monetary policy on lending activity are fairly limited, although there is some evidence that it affects lending rates more than loan volumes. Monetary policy shocks have strong effects on inflation, while the central bank reacts strongly to adverse shocks hitting the economy. Baseline results are confirmed by several robustness checks. According to historical decomposition, the lending activity was supporting economic growth before and during the crisis, but its contribution became negative during the recovery and it was a drag on growth until the end of the period. Pre-crisis GDP growth is mostly explained by supportive monetary policy. However, the restrictive monetary policy during the crisis contributed to the fall of GDP, before becoming supportive again during the early stages of the recovery.

The study obtained secondary data on Price Index for inflation, 91-day Treasury bill rate, exchange rate, money supply (M3)and repo rate for a period of five year (2008- 2012). Analysis on the various variables obtained coefficients of correlation denoted as ‘β’ which shows the strength of relationship between monetary policy tools and inflation in Kenya. The study established that inflation and the money supply were positively correlated with each other. The study established that the general level of prices increase with the increase of money supply. The study found that the 91 treasury bill rates have an impact on the level of inflation.

Thereafter, these became considerably low and more stable. This latter development has been named the ""great moderation"" with first observation in the US and comparable evidence for other developed and developing economies including South Africa. However, the 2007/2009 economic and financial crisis resulted into heightened uncertainty and volatility. This brings to question the role of monetary policy and its effectiveness in the economy. This paper examines the transmission mechanism of shocks to monetary policy in South Africa using quarterly data from 1980:1 to 2012:4. We also in addition identify demand and supply shocks. Our analyses are based on a factor-augmented vector autoregression with time-varying coefficients and stochastic volatility (TVP-FAVAR), which allows us to simultaneously analyze the changing impulse responses of a set of 177 macroeconomic variables covering the inflation, real activity, asset prices and monetary series. We also have intangible variables, such as confidence indices, and survey variables. These data capture the broad trends in the South African economy. Our results based on the impulse response functions, are consistent with economic theory as we observe no price puzzle that is often associated with the standard VAR models. We find evidence of modest time variation in the transmission of shocks. Overall, the macroeconomic variables seemed to have responded slightly more to the monetary policy shocks in the post-2000 (inflation targeting) sub-period than the pre-2000 period, albeit the differences in the effects are statistically insignificant. The forecast error variance decomposition results show the changes in the macroeconomic variables are largely determined by the demand shock relative to the monetary policy shock although the contribution of the latter increased slightly over time. Our results suggest the need for a more efficient role of the monetary authority as this will both improve its credibility and greater economic stability.

Then, we focus on the analysis of the impulse response functions of some indicators of economic growth in Morocco. The results of the analysis indicate that, the overall decline in GDP in response to monetary policy shocks suggests that they have a clearly negative impact on economic growth.","10.9790/5933-1202010111","https://hal.science/hal-03277727","Daoui_2021_monetary",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,2174

Using a large panel of banks from 12 euro area countries for the period 2002–2010 we analyze the reaction of loan supply to monetary policy actions depending on the degree of bank competition. We find that the effect of monetary policy on bank lending is dependent on bank competition: the transmission of monetary policy via the bank lending channel is less pronounced for banks with extensive market power. Further investigation shows that banks with less market power were more sensitive to monetary policy only before the financial crisis. These results suggest that bank market power has a significant impact on the effectiveness of monetary policy. Therefore, wide variations in the level of bank market power may lead to asymmetric effects of the single monetary policy.","10.1016/j.jbankfin.2014.06.018","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378426614002337","Fungáčová_2014_does",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,2176

To estimate the effects of the monetary policy in Bangladesh, at first the impact of different monetary policy tools used by the “Central Banks” of the developed countries have been reviewed. Next, the impact of the monetary policy of Bangladesh Bank and government have been analyzed for which the data on money supply, growth of the GDP, changes in the price level, and changes in the unemployment rate have been quantitatively analyzed. We mainly used Consumer Price Index to determine the level on inflation in Bangladesh. Moreover, our study focuses on data collected from the 1950-2012, mainly focusing our study from the period of 2000-2012 as major transitions have been observed in the economy during the 12 years. We have further analyzed whether there is any correlation between (i) inflation rates and money supply, and (ii) inflation rates and growth of GDP. On the basis of the outcome of the qualitative and quantitative analysis, in the end findings and conclusion have been drawn. We have found the correlation, the impacts of monetary policy and inflation, their drawbacks and possible solutions such as independence of the monetary policy from the fiscal policy and enhancing the transparency, communication and signaling effect of policy moves, keeping the broad money in line with the estimated real GDP growth, borrowing from non-bank sources, and control money supply through various open market operations. Due to lack of access to sufficient data, some of our work is based on hypothesis and models. So some data vary according to the model being used. Lastly, even though, many works have been done from the perspective of developed and other developing countries, much work has not been carried out to establish the relationship between monetary policy and inflation in Bangladesh.

We argue that the U.S. government's actions regarding policy changes in the U.S. are a source of uncertainty for Euro area investors and high levels of policy uncertainty that spill over from the U.S. drive Euro area investors to adopt a wait-and-see approach, leading to a relatively weaker (and sometimes insignificant) response of price and output to monetary tightening in the Euro area.

This study aims to analyze and evaluate the impact of Jordanian monetary policy on consumption and investment spending during the period (1989-2013) to predict the impact of monetary policy and its instruments on real economic activities and inflation. The study finds that lending rate affects investment negatively but it does not affect consumption and real GDP in the short run. However, in the long run investment is affected by the co-movements occurred in consumption lending rate and lagged investment. Also, the study finds that real GDP is affected by the co- movements that occurred in real GDP and lending rate.

Second, a Bayesian joint estimation technique of the FAVAR approach is applied to the European data in order to investigate the impacts of monetary policy shocks on the economy. Third, time variation in the transmission mechanism and the impact of the global financial crisis are investigated in the FAVAR context using a rolling windows technique. We find that there are considerable gains from the implementation of the Bayesian technique such as smoother impulse response functions and statistical significance of the estimates. According to our rolling estimations, consumer prices and monetary aggregates display the most time-variant responses to the monetary policy shocks in the EA.",NA,"https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=eoh&AN=1468472&site=ehost-live","Bagzibagli_2014_monetary",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,2199

The first essay constructs a structuralist macroeconomic model that explores channels whereby fiscal and monetary policies impact women's paid and unpaid work. The essay discusses two factors related to labor market segregation that can explain differential effects of macroeconomic policies on male and female employment: the labor intensity of female-dominated sectors, and different responses of capacity utilization to aggregate demand shocks in male and female-dominated sectors. In addition, a decline in output resulting from aggregate demand shocks may increase women's unpaid work burden when households cannot afford to buy substitutes for the output of unpaid care work. This can also create a labor supply constraint for female employment. The second essay examines the dynamic impacts of fiscal consolidation on the ratio of female employment rates to male employment rates using a dataset for 17 OECD countries over the period 1978-2009. Using a local projections method, this essay shows that fiscal consolidation has a disproportionate impact on female employment rates 3-6 years after the policy change. The impact is driven by the effect of spending-based fiscal consolidation on female employment rates. The results are robust after controlling for the female labor force participation rate, the sectoral structure of the economy, and female employment shares in different economic activities. In the third essay, I examine the dynamic effects of inflation-reduction policies on female and male employment rates in 23 OECD-European countries over the period 1998-2018 using quarterly panel data. The findings suggest that an increase in short-term interest rates, as a proxy for the monetary policy rate, leads to a decline in both female and male employment rates but does not show any significant gender effect on the ratio of employment rates. When controlling for female employment shares by broad areas of activity, an increase in short-term interest rates affects female employment rates disproportionately at the end of an eight-quarter period.",NA,"https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=eoh&AN=1869353&site=ehost-live","Akin_2020_three",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,2209

I show that these frictions amplify the response of residential construction to all economic shocks, making them central to producing the large observed historical volatility in residential construction. Further, monetary policy is transmitted to the housing market through the interest rate spread between mortgages and risk free bonds. An expansionary monetary policy shock reduces this spread, which incentivizes households on the margin between wanting to rent and wanting to own to begin searching for a house to buy and spurring new housing construction. To test the qualitative predictions of monetary policy shocks in the DSGE model, I estimate a factor-augmented vector autoregression and identify the structural monetary policy shocks with an external instrument. Consistent with the transmission mechanism in the DSGE model, an expansionary monetary policy shock reduces the interest rate spread between mortgages and Treasury bonds. Further, the identified impulse response functions of housing market variables are all consistent with the DSGE model. Chapter 2: Forecasting Residential Investment in the United States This chapter studies time series models for forecasting residential investment. It includes standard univariate and multivariate models, and proposes an error correction model (ECM) based on the stock-flow relationship of housing starts, completions and units under construction. All models are estimated on real-time data, and the root mean squared prediction errors (RMSPEs) of the models are compared along with the RMSPEs of the Survey of Professional Forecasters (SPF) and the Federal Reserve's Greenbook. For the 1981:Q3 to 2013:Q2 sample, the ECM improves upon the competing time series models and it makes modest improvements to the SPF. For the 1981:Q3 to 2007:Q4 sample, the ECM performs comparably to the Greenbook. Relative to the current state of professional forecasting, the ECM performs best at multi-step forecast horizons and in volatile economic periods. Chapter 3: Has the Impact of the Federal Funds Rate Increased? Two stylized facts of the Unites States economy are that nominal prices in the services sector change less frequently than those in the goods sector and that the size of the services sector relative to the goods sector has increased over the last 50 years. In a two-sector new Keynesian model, these facts imply that interest rate shocks should have a larger impact on output in more recent time periods. In contrast to this implication, impulse response functions of U.S. GDP to Federal Funds rate shocks estimated using both vector autoregressions and factor-augmented vector autoregressions are larger in the 1959 to 1979 time period than in the 1983 to 2007 time period. A possible explanation for this empirical result is that interest rate policy became aggressive against inflation in recent time periods. Via calibration, I show that the effects of this policy shift swamp the effects of changes to nominal stickiness and relative sector size.",NA,"https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=eoh&AN=1607782&site=ehost-live","Lunsford_2015_essays",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,2525

Nations are bound together by a network of trading and financial relationships. These relationships have been growing stronger in various ways during the last decades. This means that countries may be particularly vulnerable to economic disturbances originating in other parts of the world, especially if they rely heavily on international trade. Thus, though booms and depressions usually being in the more highly developed economies, they spread more quickly to less developed countries whose economies are closely linked to the export of a few basic raw materials products. This sensitivity to outside cyclical disturbances holds also for the less developed countries when their financial markets are underdeveloped. The increasing fluctuations in the oil prices through the last decades have been transferred to the oil exporting countries. Thus, many oil exporting countries experienced significant changes in the economic activity due to changes in the oil markets. In light of this, oil exporting countries have attempted to implement a policy that would stabilize the fluctuations in the oil markets recognizing the adverse effects of such behavior on oil exporting countries, as well as oil importing countries. Saudi Arabia, as the largest oil-exporting country and a member of OPEC, takes the role of oil-markets stabilizer by behaving as the swing producer. This role has caused the global economic fluctuations to transfer into the domestic economy. In addition, Saudi Arabian government has adopted a fixed exchange rate currency regime. Although it has contributed to domestic price stabilizations, this policy has also exposed the country to global economic disturbances. The purpose of this study is to empirically investigate these aspects for Saudi Arabia. First, the effects of shocks originated in the international markets on the Saudi Arabian economy. Second, how the fixed exchange rate regimes influences the domestic macroeconomic variables. Third, to what extent the oil sector contributes to the non-oil domestic fluctuations. Finally, how the finding from the study can be explained by economic theory. In pursuing this, there are four economic theories that are considered to explain the causes of business cycles. These theories are Classical Theory, Keynesian Theory, Monetarist Theory, and the Real Business Cycles. In addition, a theoretical model is derived that is suitable for an oil-based economy. The model follows the set up of McCallum and Nelson (1999). Then, the empirical models of Structural Vector Autoregression (SVAR) and Error Correction Model (ECM) are implemented with three different specifications: Choleski Decomposition, Block Exogeneity and long-run Cointegration Model. The empirical models then are applied to sets of data from 1980 to 2002 for Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Venezuela and Norway. The rationale of including other oil-exporting countries is to distinguish whether the shocks are country-specific, regional-specific, or global. Two sets of shocks are considered: international shocks and domestic shocks. Three types of international shocks are chosen: commodity-price (oil price) shock, international financial (interest rate) shock, and international real (output) shock. In addition, five domestic shocks which are non-oil output shock, oil production shock, price level shock, monetary shock, and exchange rate shock. The findings reached in the study demonstrate that the international shocks are responsible for a high proportion of fluctuations in the economic activity in Saudi Arabia. Most importantly, the international financial shocks represented by the US interest rate and oil price shocks are the major sources of fluctuations in the Saudi Arabian economy. Domestically, the economy is mostly affected by the oil production and the non-oil output shocks for Saudi Arabia. These results emphasize that the Saudi Arabia's role in the international oil market and its fixed exchange rate regime have significant implications on the domestic economy. Thus, special consideration should be placed on the designing the appropriate policies to lessen the dependency on the oil sector and strengthen the role of private sector to diversify the economic base, and provide an independent sound monetary policy to steer the economy from the fluctuations in the global economy.",NA,"https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=eoh&AN=0801734&site=ehost-live","Al-Abdulkarim_2004_an",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,2224

Empirically, in response to a negative productivity shock, unemployment increases substantially when financial intermediary leverage is high, but not in other episodes. The model relies primarily on the stochastic discount factor (SDF) channel. Negative productivity shocks increase the financial intermediary leverage. Because the financial intermediary sector can't raise enough funds in high leverage states, the SDF increases sharply. Meanwhile, the matching surplus is low. The negative relationship between the SDF and the matching surplus decreases the present value of future matching surpluses. Consequently, vacancy posting and employment plummet in a high leverage state. The model implies that the unemployment rate would have been 2 percentage points lower if the 2008 recession had started with the early 2001 financial intermediary leverage. Chapter 2: Financial Intermediary Leverage and Monetary Policy Transmission: The effects of monetary policy strongly depend on the leverage of the primary dealers. Monetary policy is more effective when the primary dealers have a higher share of equity in their total assets. When the equity-to-asset ratio is one percentage point above average, the effect of a monetary policy shock on the S&P 500 return is 1.44 percentage points larger. In a VAR exercise, shocks to the leverage of the primary dealers account for thirty percent of the forecast error variances of real GDP, investment, and consumption in the U.S. The leverage of the primary dealers is counter-cyclical, and thus helps explain why monetary policy is more powerful during expansions as found in the literature. Chapter 3: Asset Pricing with Heterogeneous Beliefs and Preferences under Portfolio Constraints: I study the interaction between portfolio constraints and incentives to trade. I construct a general equilibrium model in continuous time so the equilibrium conditions can be explicitly characterized. The model has two agents disagreeing about the growth rate of the dividend of a real asset. The agents also have different risk aversion parameters. Each agent faces a short sale constraint and a borrowing constraint. Furthermore, the borrowing constraint depends on the market value of the real asset. I characterize conditions under which each constraint is binding. The short sale constraint, when binding, decreases the equity premium and the market price of risk of the real asset. The borrowing constraint, when binding, increases the equity premium and the market price of risk of the real asset. The long-run probability density of the model states features two modes concentrating on either end of the state space, so both agents have positive wealth in the long run.",NA,"https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=eoh&AN=1936589&site=ehost-live","Li_2020_essays",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,2527

The model captures the dynamic interaction of the key sectors in the economy and it accounts for the fact that the banking system in those countries is characterized by high levels of excess reserves. Also, the study assumes that the central bank conducts monetary policy using a Taylor-type rule, and it evaluates the effects of a reserve requirement policy. The results show that although a positive shock to the policy interest rate has a direct effect on commercial banks’ interest rates, there is a weak transmission to the real variables. Furthermore, an increase in the required reserve ratio is successful in reducing private sector credit and excess reserves, while at the same time alleviating pressures on the exchange rate. The findings therefore indicate that central banks in small open economies should consider using reserve requirements as a complement to interest rate policy, to achieve their macroeconomic objectives.","10.1016/j.jpolmod.2018.03.001","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0161893818300425","Primus_2018_the",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,2226

Negative developments after 2008 still verify the ability of monetary policy to mitigate its impacts. In the EMU, it can be seen in the case of the effects of single monetary policy and the deepening of the asymmetries between member countries. This can be compared to the case of monetary policy efficiency in small and open non-member countries and its influence on macroeconomic developments. This paper is focused on analysis of the transmission process of monetary policy through the interest rate channel in the EMU as well as in a non-member country, namely in the Czech Republic. The aim of the analysis was to verify the similarity of reaction in case of monetary policy shock. The results for the Czech Republic were compared to results for the overall EMU. The focus was predominantly on the interest rate channel of monetary transmission process and its impact on inflation, nominal effective exchange rate, and gross domestic product, the variables that are typically used in central banks' monetary rules. We also assumed that negative developments related to the crisis can distort the transmission of monetary policy effects on macroeconomic variables and that the impact of monetary policy changes is transmitted to the economic variables only partially or significantly lagged. The effects of interest rate shocks on selected variables were identified by estimating a VAR model that uses the Cholesky decomposition of innovations, the most widely used empirical methodology for analysing the transmission mechanism of monetary policy. The results show that the reactions of the product and the price level to positive interest rate shock are very similar for the Czech Republic as well as for the EMU throughout the investigated period 1999-2013.

SSA's rapid growth, its integration with the global economy, changes in the policy frameworks, among others, in the last decade suggest that the drivers of inflation may have changed. We quantitatively analyze inflation dynamics in SSA using a Global VAR model, which incorporates trade and financial linkages among economies, as well as the role of regional and global demand and inflationary spillovers. We find that in the past 25 years, the main drivers of inflation have been domestic supply shocks and shocks to exchange rate and monetary variables; but that, in recent years, the contribution of these shocks to inflation has fallen. Domestic demand pressures as well as global shocks, and particularly shocks to output, however, have played a larger role in driving inflation over the last decade. We also show that country characteristics matter--the extent of oil and food imports, vulnerability to weather shocks, economic importance of agriculture, trade openness and policy regime, among others, help in explaining the role of shocks.",NA,"https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=eoh&AN=1517469&site=ehost-live","Nguyen_2015_on",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,2237

We use a ‘structural VAR’ approach with non-recursive contemporaneous restrictions and we identify monetary policy shocks by modeling the reaction function of the monetary authorities and the structure of the economy. Our empirical findings are that effects of non-US G-7 monetary policy shocks on exchange rates and other macroeconomic variables are consistent with the predictions of a broad set of theoretical models. The evidence is consistent with significant, but transitory, real effects of monetary shocks. The ‘price’ puzzle is addressed and there is little evidence of open economy anomalies. Specifically, initially the exchange rate appreciates in response to a monetary contraction; but after a few months, the exchange rate depreciates over time in accordance with the uncovered interest parity condition.

However, the sparse information sets typically used in these empirical models lead to at least three potential problems with the results. First, to the extent that central banks and the private sector have information not reflected in the VAR, the measurement of policy innovations is likely to be contaminated. Second, the choice of a specific data series to represent a general economic concept such as “real activity” is often arbitrary to some degree. Third, impulse responses can be observed only for the included variables, which generally constitute only a small subset of the variables that the researcher and policy-maker care about. In this paper we investigate one potential solution to this limited information problem, which combines the standard structural VAR analysis with recent developments in factor analysis for large data sets.

More importantly is the relationship based on regional or monetary union, which has not received much attention especially in sub-Saharan Africa as against the much developed economies. In this paper, the Structural-Vector Auto Regressive (S-VAR) model was employed to investigate the interactions between some selected economic variables and growth in the Economic Community of West Africa (ECOWAS) monetary union from 1980:Q1-2015:Q4. These variables are oil price and commodity price volatilities, net domestic credit, inflation rate, exchange rate, money supply, monetary policy and gross domestic product growth rate. To start with, the study tested for the presence of unit roots in order to ensure the stationarity of variables. This was followed by the confirmation of long run relationship among the variables, using the Panel ARDL model. The result of the eight S-VAR variables reveals that oil and commodity price volatilities constitute important exogenous disturbances to monetary policy. The medium through which this works is the exchange rate; and from exchange rate to money supply. Finally, this effect is passed on from money supply to the growth rate of the gross domestic product. In addition, the Impulse Response Analysis and Variance Decomposition outcomes show exchange rate to be playing dominant role in determining the behavior of monetary policy within the ECOWAS region. In this regard, the supply of money is the major transmitter of all the interactions to the growth rate of the gross domestic product as it dictates the behavior of the GDP growth rate more than other variables in the S-VAR model. One policy implication from the results of this study is that the recent monetary policy tightening in most of the ECOWAS countries to mitigate the rise in inflation rate may adversely affect economic growth of the region. This is because investment may be discouraged as a result of high lending rate. Not only that, any monetary shock especially in terms of the exchange rate could have adverse symmetric effect on the economies of the region.",NA,"https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=eoh&AN=1907718&site=ehost-live","Olamide_2019_regional",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,2255

Our empirical evidence reveals that tight monetary policy, which, in this case, is captured with a positive shock to interest rate, decreases exchange rate, output and prices, as economic theory suggests. Loose monetary policy, which is captured with a negative shock to interest rate, has the opposite effect on these variables. However, the effects of loose monetary policy are weaker than the effects of tight monetary policy because loose monetary policy shocks are less effective than tight monetary policy shocks. Moreover, as the magnitude of a shock increases, the difference between the effects of tight and loose monetary policy policies also increases.","10.1080/13504851.2015.1073836","https://doi.org/10.1080/13504851.2015.1073836","Ülke_2016_asymmetric",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,2261

In disequilibrium, interest rates should be far less useful as policy variable, and economics should be more concerned with quantities (including resource constraints). To investigate, we test the received belief that lower interest rates result in higher growth and higher rates result in lower growth. Examining the relationship between 3-month and 10-year benchmark rates and nominal GDP growth over half a century in four of the five largest economies we find that interest rates follow GDP growth and are consistently positively correlated with growth. If policy-makers really aimed at setting rates consistent with a recovery, they would need to raise them.

On the whole, income inequality today is greater than it was when the Bank of Canada became an inflation-targeting central bank.

We then show that these effects are asymmetric with expansionary shocks having a greater impact on income inequality than contractionary shocks. Expansionary monetary policy shocks result in a higher share of national income shifting to higher income households, who consume less as a percentage of their income, dampening the increase in aggregate demand, and, therefore, inflation.Our results lead to one particularly important conclusion for monetary policy: namely, that the Bank of Canada needs to account for the impact of income inequality when modeling how inflation will respond to a change in the overnight rate.","10.2139/ssrn.3533379","https://papers.ssrn.com/abstract=3533379","Kronick_2020_monetary",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,2265

For this reason, it is important to examine the effects of applied policies on real economic activities and inflation. Accordingly, the 2008 global financial crisis revealed the importance of the relationship between monetary policy, house prices, and real economic activity, in other words, the channel of transmission of house prices. As a matter of fact, developments in the housing industry have a significant impact on the process leading up to the 2008 Global financial crisis. In this context, after the 2008 Global financial crisis, both the role of house prices in monetary policy implementation and the function of house prices in the transmission mechanism has begun to be questioned. In this study, the effectiveness of the house prices transmission channel, a subgroup of the asset prices channel based on the experience of the 2008 Global financial crisis, was empirically analyzed based on the Turkish economy.

The purpose of this study is to investigate the inflationary tendencies in India particularly from the fiscal point of view. The study also examines the influence of other potential determinants such as output growth rate, interest rate, trade-openness (TO) and oil price inflation (OPI). Design/methodology/approach: To examine the dynamic nature of association between fiscal deficit and inflation, the study applies the Toda-Yamamoto (1995) test and Breitung and Candelon (2006) test to investigate the nature of causality in time and frequency domain frameworks. In addition, to scrutinize the possibility of a long-run association, that too from an asymmetric point of view, the study applies a Non-linear Autoregressive Distributed lag model (NARDL) given by Shin et al. (2014). Finally, non-linear cumulative dynamic multipliers are used to trace the traverse between disequilibrium position of short-run and subsequent long-run equilibrium of the system. Findings: The authors found a unidirectional causality from fiscal deficit to inflation in case of time domain analysis and no feedback causality is reported. However, in case of frequency domain design, causality from fiscal deficit to inflation is found at low frequencies only, i.e. no short-run causality is established and hence dynamic nature of the relationship between the two variables is vindicated. Using NARDL model, the results document the existence of an asymmetric long-run direct association between fiscal deficit and inflation. However, an increase in deficit is found to be more inflationary and a decrease affects the inflation with a lower magnitude. The asymmetric impact of fiscal deficit on inflation can be explained through the existence of liquidity constraints, consumption-investment downward inflexibility and the downward price stickiness. Contractionary monetary policy action is found to be more effective than an expansionary one, signifying the asymmetric influence of monetary policy actions on the inflation of India. Similarly, in a supply-constrained economy with downward price rigidity, the authors found an asymmetric impact of output growth and output decline on inflation. As regard to the trade-openness, although an asymmetry is reported, the signs refute the validation of Romer (1993) hypothesis.

The first paper is my job market paper. In it, I investigate the role of systematic U.S. monetary policy in the presence of oil price shocks. The second paper compares different approaches to modeling oil demand. The third paper studies the empirical performance of Laplace type estimators for estimation of macroeconomic models. Optimal Monetary Policy and Oil Price Shocks. In an influential paper, Bernanke, Gertler, and Watson (1997) and (2004) argue that systematic monetary policy exacerbated the recessions the U.S. economy experienced in the aftermath of post World War II oil price shocks. In my job market paper, I critically evaluate this claim in the context of an estimated medium-scale model of the U.S. business cycle. Specifically, I solve for the Ramsey optimal monetary policy in the medium-scale dynamic stochastic general equilibrium model (henceforth DSGE) of Schmitt-Groh and Uribe (2005). To model the demand for oil, I use the approach of Finn (2000). According to this approach, the utilization of capital services requires oil usage. In the related literature on the macroeconomic effects of oil price shocks, it is common to calibrate structural parameters of the model. In contrast to this literature, I estimate the parameters of my DSGE model. The estimation strategy involves matching the impulse responses from the theoretical model to responses predicted by an empirical model. For estimation, I use the alternative to the classical Laplace type estimator proposed by Chernozhukov and Hong (2003). To obtain the empirical impulse responses, I identify an oil price shock in a structural VAR (SVAR) model of the U.S. business cycle. The SVAR model predicts that, in response to an oil price increase, GDP, investment, hours, capital utilization, and the real wage fall, while the nominal interest rate and inflation rise. These findings are economically intuitive and in line with the existing empirical evidence. Comparing the actual and the Ramsey optimal monetary policy response to an oil price shock, I find that the optimal policy allows for more inflation, a larger drop in wages, and a rise in hours compared to those actually observed. The central finding of this paper is that the optimal policy is associated with a smaller drop in GDP and other macroeconomic variables. The latter results therefore confirm the claim of Bernanke, Gertler and Watson that monetary policy was to a large extent responsible for the recessions that followed the oil price shocks. However, under the optimal policy, interest rates are tightened even more than what is predicted by the empirical model. This result contrasts sharply with the claim of Bernanke, Gertler, and Watson that the Federal Reserve exacerbated recessions by the excessive tightening of interest rates in response to the oil price increases. In contrast to related studies that focus on output stabilization, I find that eliminating the negative response of GDP to an oil price shock is not desirable. Comparing Different Ways to Introduce Energy. The existing literature adopts different strategies to introduce energy demand into a theoretical model. In this paper, I compare how the extant approaches to modeling energy demand change the predictions of the models and policy advice. First, I compare basic models of energy demand. As the next step, I study DSGE models where nominal and real rigidities are combined with different assumptions about energy demand. I show that to provide realistic predictions about the dynamic response of macroeconomic variables, it is crucial to properly calibrate these models. I find that policy recommendations are sensitive to the choice of the model parameters. Classical Extremum and Laplace Type Estimators: a Comparison for the Estimation of Macroeconomic Models--with Riccardo DiCecio. Estimation of economic models with a large parameter space is often complicated because of highly nonlinear criterion functions used for estimation. Standard estimation techniques, such as classical extremum estimators, are time-consuming and do not guarantee that the estimates are global extrema. A new estimator, the Laplace type estimator, has been recently proposed as an alternative. This estimator is computationally more attractive and has the same asymptotic properties as its classical minimum distance counterpart. In this paper, we compare the performance of the classical minimum distance estimator with the Laplace type estimator as it applies to the estimation of macroeconomic models. The criterion function is derived from the distance of impulse responses of macroeconomic variables in the model from the corresponding responses in structural VAR representations of the data. We compare the two estimation techniques using a simple RBC economy, subject to neutral and embodied technology shocks. We also compare the performance of the two techniques by estimating a medium scale Dynamic Stochastic General Equilibrium model routinely used to study the effect of monetary policy shocks.",NA,"https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=eoh&AN=1002828&site=ehost-live","Kozlavskaya_2008_optimal",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,2284

The differential sectoral effects depend upon factors such as capital intensity, interest sensitivity, export-orientation, production planning strategies among others. The sectors also differ in terms of the most effective channel of monetary transmission.

For that purpose, assuming that the interest rate is determined by means of the Taylor rule, the changes in interest rate were decomposed into anticipated and surprise components. NARDL enables us to observe the asymmetric effects of monetary policy in terms of the size of shocks and the stance of the shocks. The findings of this study support the idea that, in Turkey, while unanticipated monetary policy shocks have symmetric effects on production, their effects on inflation are asymmetric. Regarding the direction of the policy, positive and negative interest rate changes exert a significant positive effect on inflation. Regarding the size of monetary policy, only big shocks have a considerable effect on inflation. Augmented central bank reaction function with asymmetric relationship might enrich information for policymakers and improve the effectiveness of monetary policy.

It is a country-specific, time series study that verifies the implication of increasing economic openness on the efficacy of monetary and fiscal policy. A modified GARCH model was used to estimate the anticipated and unanticipated shocks. Two measures of fiscal and monetary shocks were combined with openness and real oil price shocks in a VECM model to assess the effects of anticipated and unanticipated policy shocks on the output equations. The empirical results showed that anticipated and unanticipated fiscal and monetary shocks had no significant positive effects on real output. This suggests that the open macroeconomic version of the policy ineffectiveness proposition was valid for both monetary and fiscal policy shocks in Nigeria. This is in consonance with earlier works in this area. Furthermore, the degree of openness and oil price shocks had a negative implication on the efficacy of macroeconomic policy in Nigeria; also in agreement with the Dutch Disease Syndrome. Finally, the policy implication of this study therefore is that trade liberalization policy should be implemented cautiously. The Nigerian economy is weak to withstand the unwholesome consequences of full economic integration.","10.1111/j.1467-8268.2008.00197.x","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1467-8268.2008.00197.x","Saibu_2008_openness",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,2287

In late 2000s with the financial crisis, critiques have argued that these economies had fallen into liquidity trap sooner because of the policy mistake of adhering to the 2% inflation target when the policy rate was already too close to zero. As the argument goes, since there was not enough room left to maneuver, central bankers were powerless in their attempt to revive the economy when aggregate demand collapsed. Using SVAR methodology, this paper formally investigates whether unanticipated deviation of OECD short-term rates from the fund rate can indeed explain differential unemployment rate with the US. It also discusses whether low-inflation targeting monetary policy is to be blamed for the financial crisis. The results show that interest rate differential shocks have no effects on unemployment in the very short-run. However, in the long-run, the cost for deviating drastically from US monetary policy is indeed higher and persistent unemployment at home, on average 30, 102, and 186 basis-points after 10, 15, and 20 quarters, respectively for the period 1989q1–2009q4. This cost is on average higher for inflation- than non-inflation targeting countries. These findings suggest that the fear of unemployment was partly the reason central bankers kept interest rate low since commodity prices were falling as a result of globalization while the economies were returning to normal partly due to positive supply shocks. Since Canada had its interest rate well aligned with the fund rate prior to the crisis while the inflation target was 2%, but did not suffer as much because sound mortgage rules and financial regulation were in place, the view that higher inflation target might have produced a different outcome does not seem to rest on firm grounds. Therefore, this paper lends support to the view that lax mortgage rules and financial deregulations in the US were the main factors responsible for the crisis.","10.1016/j.econmod.2012.09.042","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264999312003173","Jean Louis_2013_lowinflationtargeting",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,2291

This can take place when the policy instruments – interest rates (Repo) and money supply growth (M3) – have significant effects on these macroeconomic variables. However, the issue of the efficacy of monetary policy on GDP growth and employment creation is at the centre of debates among researchers. Some researchers are of the opinion that the objective of monetary policy in achieving and maintaining price stability is founded on the idea that inflation is not good for economic growth, employment creation and income equality but, instead, only secures macroeconomic environment. In South Africa, the efficiency of different monetary policy tools, inflation and money-supply targeting, on economic performance has been questioned. Moreover, the issue of the high level of unemployment remains controversial among scholars. Therefore, the structural vector-error correction model (VECM) methods was used with quarterly data in order to investigate the impact of aggregate money supply (M3), interest rate (Repo) and real exchange rate on CPIX (inflation) , economic growth (GDP volume rate) and unemployment (joblessness rate) in South Africa for the period 1986 to 2010. The results show that both monetary-policy regimes have positively impacted on economic growth, but the impact of the pre-inflation-targeting regime is higher. Moreover, a weak positive liaison between monetary policy and unemployment is observed, but the post-inflation-targeting regime shows a higher percentage decrease in unemployment than the pre-inflation targeting period.

The empirical factor literature argues that the co-movement of large panels of macroeconomic and financial data can be captured by relatively few common unobserved factors. Similarly, the dynamics in DSGE models are often governed by a handful of state variables and exogenous processes such as latent preference and/or technology shocks. A general topic of this dissertation is the estimation of DSGE models on a rich panel of macroeconomic and financial data by combining a DSGE with a dynamic factor model. By incorporating richer information, this combination allows to obtain DSGE model predictions and to do more reliable policy analysis with a broader range of data series of interest than before. Moreover, the combination of a DSGE and a dynamic factor model can be used as a tool for evaluating a DSGE model. This dissertation consists of three essays summarized below. Chapter 1 ""Bayesian Dynamic Factor Analysis of a Simple Monetary DSGE Model"": We take a standard New Keynesian business cycle model to a richer data set. When estimating DSGE models, the number of observable economic variables is usually kept small, and for convenience it is assumed that the model variables are perfectly measured by a single--often quite arbitrarily selected--data series. We relax these two assumptions and estimate a fairly simple monetary DSGE model on a richer data set. Building upon Boivin and Giannoni (2006), the framework can be seen as a combination of a DSGE model and a dynamic factor model in which factors are economic state variables and the factor dynamics are governed by a DSGE model solution. Using post-1983 U.S. data on real output, inflation, nominal interest rates, measures of inverse money velocity, and a large panel of informational series, we compare the data-rich DSGE model with a regular--few observables, perfect measurement--DSGE model in terms of deep parameter estimates, propagation of monetary policy and technology shocks and sources of business cycle fluctuations. We document that the data-rich DSGE model generates a higher implied duration of Calvo price contracts and a lower slope of the New Keynesian Phillips curve. Because of the data set's high panel dimension, the likelihood-based estimation of the data-rich DSGE model is computationally very challenging. To reduce the costs, we employed a novel speedup as in Jungbacker and Koopman (2008) and achieved the computational time savings of 60 percent. Chapter 2 ""Data-Rich DSGE and Dynamic Factor Models"": In addition to a datarich DSGE model with a standard New Keynesian core, we consider an unrestricted dynamic factor model and estimate both on a rich panel of U.S. macroeconomic and financial data compiled by Stock and Watson (2008). We find that the spaces spanned by the common empirical factors and by the data-rich DSGE model states are very close. First, this implies that a DSGE model indeed captures the essential sources of co-movement in the data and that the differences in fit between a data-rich DSGE model and a DFM are potentially due to restricted factor loadings in the former. Second, this also implies a greater degree of comfort about propagation of structural shocks to a wide array of macro and financial series. Third, the proximity of factor spaces facilitates economic interpretation of a dynamic factor model, as the empirical factors are now isomorphic to the DSGE model state variables with clear economic meaning. Finally, the proximity of factor spaces allows us to propagate monetary policy and technology innovations in an otherwise completely non-structural dynamic factor model to obtain predictions for many more series than just a handful of traditional macro variables including measures of real activity, price indices, labor market indicators, interest rate spreads, money and credit stocks, and exchange rates. We can therefore provide a more complete and comprehensive picture of the effects of monetary policy and technology shocks. Chapter 3 ""DSGE Model Based Forecasting of Non-Modeled Variables"" (joint work with Frank Schorfheide and Keith Sill): We develop and illustrate a simple method to generate a DSGE model-based forecast for variables that do not explicitly appear in the model (non-core variables). Estimation is performed in two steps. First, we estimate the regular DSGE model on core observables. Second, we obtain filtered DSGE model state variables and use them as regressors in auxiliary linear regressions--resembling DFM measurement equations--for the non-core variables. Predictions for the non-core variables are then obtained by applying their estimated measurement equations to DSGE model-generated forecasts of the state variables. This estimation approach can be viewed as a simplified version of a data-rich DSGE model estimation in which we essentially decouple the analysis of the non-core measurement equations and the estimation of a DSGE model on the core observables. The proposed shortcut is practically appealing: we considerably reduce the associated computational costs and we can incorporate and forecast an additional non-core variable without having to re-estimate the whole DSGE model, a feature useful in real-time applications. We apply our approach to generate and evaluate recursive forecasts for personal consumption expenditure (PCE) inflation, core PCE inflation, the unemployment rate, and housing starts.",NA,"https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=eoh&AN=1143004&site=ehost-live","Kryshko_2010_essays",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,2298

Using the Johansen cointegration test and Vector Error Correction Model, our results show that: there is one cointegration in the model and the current levels of the discount rate, reserve requirement and liquidity requirement bear a negative and significant effect to bank credit to the private sector. This indicates that the three instruments are not supportive to economic growth and they are not optimal to stimulate credit. Applying the Quadratic approach, findings of this study reveal that the optimal monetary policy mix (thresholds) to stimulate bank credit to the private sector while maintaining inflation within reasonable levels is 5.42% for the discount rate, 4.03% for the reserve requirement, 12.48% for the liquidity requirement.

Our Monte Carlo analysis sheds light on the performance of proxy SVARs under realistic scenarios of low relative signal strength attached to MP shocks and alternative assumptions on instrument accuracy. In an empirical application with US data we argue in favor of the specific informational content of instruments based on the dynamic stochastic general equilibrium model of Smets and Wouters (2007). A joint assessment of the benchmark proxy SVAR and the outcomes of a structural covariance change model implies that from 1973 until 1979 monetary policy contributed on average between 2.2 and 2.4 percent of annual inflation.

The success of macroeconomic stabilization, typically in the hands of monetary policy, is not only determined by a suitable choice of the nominal anchor, which shapes the reaction function of monetary policy, but also the constraints within which the monetary policy strives to achieve its objectives. The key attributes of the constraints to macroeconomic stabilization are economic rigidities and structural shocks. By benchmarking the estimated economic rigidities and structural shocks faced by Macedonia to those faced by Slovakia, the authors find that Macedonia has relatively weaker transmission mechanisms of monetary policy, higher output rigidity, and a lower exchange rate pass-through, and faces larger external shocks. For Macedonia, these relatively higher constraints on monetary policy together with the chosen exchange rate anchor result in greater output and inflation volatility relative to Slovakia. Hence, it appears that small, open economies with stronger economic rigidities should apply monetary policy regimes that allow for more flexible adjustments in external relative prices to enhance their macroeconomic stability.",NA,"https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=eoh&AN=1007229&site=ehost-live","Melecky_2008_comparing",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,2311

In a structural vector autoregressive setting there has been some controversy about which restrictions to use for identifying the shocks because standard theories do not provide enough information to fully identify monetary policy shocks. In fact, to compare different theories it would even be desirable to have over-identifying restrictions that would make statistical tests of different theories possible. It is pointed out that some progress toward over-identifying monetary policy shocks can be made by using specific data properties. In particular, it is shown that changes in the volatility of the shocks can be used for identification. Based on monthly U.S. data from 1965 to 1996 different theories are tested and it is found that associating monetary policy shocks with shocks to nonborrowed reserves leads to a particularly strong rejection of the model whereas assuming that the Fed accommodates demand shocks to total reserves cannot be rejected.","10.1111/j.1538-4616.2008.00151.x","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1538-4616.2008.00151.x","Lanne_2008_identifying",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,2312

An interest rate shock (or contractionary monetary policy shock) causes exchange rate (KRW/foreign) to fall (or Korean Won to appreciate) and trade balance to worsen. Money supply shocks lead to a depreciation of the Korean Won and an improvement of the trade balance. Price level shocks cause the Korean Won to depreciate and the trade balance to improve. The output shocks lead to an appreciation of the Korean Won, worsening the trade balance. In addition, the exchange rate depreciation shock of the Korean Won leads to an improvement in the trade balance. The results show that exchange rate overshooting is found only from its own exchange rate shock. We find no evidence of J-curve effect.

Finally, some postulates concerning desirable monetary policy are formulated. The analyses provided meaningful results.

It was also noticed that the use of expansive monetary policy for the purposes of business cycle support comes at a cost of rising inflation. As a result, expansive monetary policy should never be used in a consecutive manner, but rather as a short-run, transitory source of economic stimulation, so as to fulfil the definition of a temporary shock.

The study results show that Bank Indonesia's accommodative interest rate policy with low-interest rates during the recession due to the Covid-19 pandemic positively influences economic growth. However, in the long-term, interest rates must compete with interest rates from other countries to encourage investment capital flows to Indonesia. The findings show that innovation has not yet affected economic growth in Indonesia, but economic growth fosters innovation to accelerate technology transfer from developed countries through foreign investment. Therefore, the support of the Government and Bank of Indonesia to provide incentives through tax breaks and low-interest rates to business actors developing R&amp;D and innovation will encourage accelerating technology and innovation growth in Indonesia.","10.22219/jep.v20i01.18896","https://ejournal.umm.ac.id/index.php/jep/article/view/18896","Sebayang_2022_monetary",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,2322

The results of the unit root tests show that the series of interest are stationary in first differences. Cointegretion and causality between the variables are tested and compared using tri-variate vector Autoregressive model (VAR). The results of co-integration tests on the tri-variate models show that two Granger-causality alternative models (VAR in first difference and Error Correction Models) fit for this study. In both types of models, Granger-causality (unidirectional or bidirectional causations) between monetary policy instrument on one side and price and economic growth on the other side are tested using Chi – square and F – statistics from Wald coefficient restriction test. The results of cointegration test shows that there is a long run equilibrium relation between the variables. The error correction model and the Wald Granger causality indicates the existence of short run bidirectional causality between money supply and price level, and unidirectional causation running from output to price level that shows that price level is a monetary phenomenon in the short run.

The first chapter investigates the external sector as it relates to imports and the potential role for monetary policy. The second chapter jointly investigates the monetary and external sectors regarding monetary exchange rate policy and its implications. The third chapter investigates the monetary sector concerning monetary policy operating procedures and the macroeconomic effects. The first chapter examines liquidity effects on the demand for imports of non-durable consumers' goods in Trinidad and Tobago. A parsimonious vector equilibrium correction model (VEqCM) is developed to test the hypotheses that liquidity has both long- and short-run effects. Multivariate cointegration analysis reveals a long-run relation among consumers' imports, output, liquidity and relative prices. General-to-specific (Gets) modeling via Autometrics reveals significant short-run liquidity and asymmetric foreign and domestic price effects. The VEqCM seems a sufficient approximation of the underlying data generation process, demonstrates desirable statistical properties and empirically constant parameters, encompasses the findings of previous specifications and produces reliable forecasts. The second chapter presents an approach for empirically estimating long-run monetary policy rules in small open economies. The approach utilizes the cointegrated VAR methodology and statistical tests on long- and short-run relations, and investigates policy responses. An application is presented for the case of Trinidad and Tobago. The analysis reveals an empirically supported long-run monetary policy rule for the nominal exchange rate, and also provides empirical evidence that oil price shocks are transmitted through the TT economy in part via the effects on US prices. Dynamic specification of the nominal exchange rate reveals significant adjustment towards the target equilibrium level, and significant effects from foreign and domestic variables save for the exchange rate. The parsimonious model and its parameter estimates are empirically constant and generate reliable forecasts that provide important implications for using estimated policy rules. The third chapter investigates the extent to which the effects of the Dutch Disease are brought on by the monetary policy responses, perhaps systematic, to energy sector economic activity. The approach utilizes impulse response analysis and the cointegrated VAR methodology. The Trinidad and Tobago economy is examined. There are three key findings: (i) both the long-run and short- run energy and non-energy income elasticities of inflation are asymmetric, (ii) monetary policy and its targets respond asymmetrically to energy and non-energy income shocks, and (iii) systematic policy responses to energy and non-energy income shocks are asymmetric and make worse the Dutch Disease.

Calls for lower interest rates have become louder as the country's private driven growth has slowed down. However, monetary policy faces the challenges of maintaining external stability and reviving domestic conditions, which could necessitate conflicting interest rate policies. To determine which goals are most suitable for monetary policy, one must understand the effects of monetary policy and its transmission channels to the macro economy. Our empirical results suggest that monetary policy in Turkey has fairly limited power to affect output growth, even in the short-run. We find that external factors--such as shocks to risk aversion and global growth--have a much stronger impact on economic activity in Turkey. These results seem to be in line with the strand of the literature, which highlights the importance of global financial cycles and argues that exchange rate flexibility alone is not enough to guarantee monetary autonomy in a world of large capital flows. Consequently, our empirical findings corroborate the notion that monetary policy should focus on its overriding objective of price stability, given Turkey's greater exposure to supply shocks and pro-cyclicality of international finance.","10.1080/17938120.2019.1664838","https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=eoh&AN=1806916&site=ehost-live","Domac_2019_on",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,2357

Chapter 1 studies the systemic credit crunch in the 2008 financial crisis, highlighting a novel contagion channel between financial intermediaries. It shows the excessive risk-taking of unregulated shadow banks can lead to a lending contraction in regulated traditional banks via the general equilibrium effect of housing prices, regardless of direct connections between the two banking sectors. This channel qualitatively explains why traditional banks did not fill the credit gap created by the shrinking shadow banking sector, but instead cut lending. A quantitative dynamic general equilibrium model shows that capturing both banking sectors' credit contraction amplifies the aggregate credit loss during the Great Recession by a fifth. Analysis of this channel suggests that tighter regulation on traditional banks in normal times, by shifting lending to shadow banks, may hurt traditional banks in crises. Chapter 2 studies the state dependence of fiscal multipliers on household financial conditions. In a model of household collateral constraints, I endogenize the borrowing capacity and allow occasionally binding collateral constraints. The model implies that the worsening financial conditions increase both the tightness of the collateral constraint and the fraction of households that are subject to a collateral constraint, thereby higher marginal propensity to consume and borrow in the aggregate, which raises fiscal multipliers. The interaction between fiscal policy and financial conditions favors the use of countercyclical fiscal policy and gradual implementation. Chapter 3 studies the monetary policy channel in fiscal transmission, by shutting down the channel in nonlinear vector autoregressive (VAR) models. I find that the channel effect of monetary policy on the state dependence of fiscal multipliers is neither statistically nor economically significant, in part due to a small impact of fiscal policy on monetary policy. Within expansions, monetary policy may improve fiscal multipliers, due to its stabilization role in reaction to lower inflation and output following fiscal shocks in this regime.",NA,"https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=eoh&AN=1807806&site=ehost-live","Zhu_2019_essays",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,2358

Utilizing the Romer and Romer examination of the minutes of Federal Open Market Committee meetings to determine dates on which the Fed attempted to create a recession to reduce inflation, antiinflationary policy shocks can be estimated to increase unemployment among nonwhites more than twice as much as they do among whites.

The size of the balance of payments offset is relatively large, but the models differ on its size. Domestic credit appears to have a weak effect on national output. Neither domestic credit nor the exchange rate play much of a role in explaining variation in inflation in Colombia. Inflation appears to be primarily inertial and the result of demand shocks. The results are consistent with the recent difficulties encountered in maintaining monetary targets in Colombia, and the persistence of inflation under contractionary monetary policy.","10.1016/0304-3878(94)00052-E","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/030438789400052E","Kamas_1995_monetary",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,2367

To address this, the authors examine two possible linear and non-linear relationships between inflation and income inequality and between gross domestic product (GDP) and income inequality. Using various measures of income inequality, the results of the pooled model and the individual fixed effect model show that CPI inflation positively and interest rate negatively affect all measures of income inequality in linear regression. The results confirm the existence of the non-linearity relationship between inflation and income inequality as well as the Kuznets inverted ?U-shaped? hypothesis between GDP and income inequality. The results of linear and non-linear regressions show that the DC and the state of Ohio are better off and worse off than the state of Alabama as baseline of models, respectively. The impulse response functions (IRFs) for the individual panel vector autoregressive (PVAR) models show that income inequality could be reduced by implementing contractionary monetary policy through interest rate channel in the short run and increased persistently pursuing contractionary monetary policies via inflation channel in the long run.","10.1111/1759-3441.12279","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/1759-3441.12279","Siami-Namini_2020_the",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,2368

Such distortions appear in the data as persistent hump-shaped responses in unemployment and output levels. The standard New Keynesian model has failed to generate such persistence, even with the inclusion of frictions like staggered wage contracts and habit formation. Adding a simple labor market matching model with heterogenous response by the households and the firms overcomes these shortcomings. We show that adverse monetary policy shocks to curb inflationary pressures increase the reservation opportunity cost of not working, by increasing the debt servicing burden of households. These same shocks reduce product demand, causing the reservation productivity a firm is willing to accept from new hires to increase. Thus labor supply increases as a result of adverse monetary shocks while labor demand falls or remains unchanged, thereby widening the cyclical variations between job destruction and job creation. This gap between desired and actual employment and output levels is suggested as a cause of observed unemployment persistence.",NA,"https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=eoh&AN=1335708&site=ehost-live","Guha_2012_an",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,2373

This was accentuated by money supply variable (MS2) and aggravated by exchange rate variable which are mostly positive, confirming the a priori expectations that rapid monetary expansion and devaluations fuels domestic inflation.   A country by country comparison of the single and simultaneous equations model results show that expansionary monetary policy contributed more to fuelling prices than it did to growth.

According to economic theory, the conventional policy regime has central banks stabilize inflation by raising nominal interest rate more than one-for-one with inflation while the government adjusts taxes or spending to assure fiscal solvency. Under the alternative regime, fiscal policy determines the price level and monetary policy acts to stabilize debt. These two policy regimes imply completely different mechanisms in price level determination. As a result, each policy regime has a different implication for policy authorities. Chapter One focuses on analytical aspects--the determinacy and identification--of monetary and fiscal policy regime interactions in an exogenous regime switching model. For distinct two views, conventional and alternative views, determinacy condition and analytical solution are obtained where actively behaved policy rule has state-dependent policy coefficients. Moreover, it is shown that the monetary policy rule is still not identified in the regime switching model. Chapter Two, joint with Yoosoon Chang, investigates dynamic interaction among monetary and fiscal policy regimes using a regime switching model where regimes are represented by endogenous latent policy factors. Two main findings emerge. First, estimated policy coefficients imply that MP and FP behavior fluctuates between two theoretically interpretable regimes. Second, shocks that switch one policy from active to passive tend to induce the other policy to switch from passive to active, consistent with existence of a unique equilibrium. Chapter Three further demonstrates interactions between policy regimes and macro economy using extracted policy factors from endogenous regime switching monetary and fiscal policy rules. Latent policy regime factors have substantial predictive power for the key macro variables and dynamic impacts that accord well with a priori expectations. Main findings from Chapter Two and Three imply both that endogenous regime change policy rules can uncover potentially important policy interactions and that those interactions bear more thorough economic analysis.",NA,"https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=eoh&AN=1607042&site=ehost-live","Kwak_2016_three",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,2394

Furthermore, the chapter investigates empirically, using V AR systems, the existence of each channel in the changing financial environment are evaluated for aggregate data (all banks) and disaggregate data across five groups of banks (foreign banks, private banks, mixed banks, regional banks and state banks) by investigating their impulse responses, variance decompositions and accumulated effects. Our observation covers the period of January 1980 to December 2001. In order to capture the effect of financial deregulation which assumed to bring innovations in monetary policy and the effect of 1997 financial crisis, we divide the whole period into three sub period: Period 1 (1980:01-1988:12) in which captures the first 1983 financial deregulation; Period 2 (1988:01-1996:12) in which covers the second big 1988 financial deregulation; and Period 3 (1997:01-2001:12) which include the 1997 financial crisis. In Chapter 5, we examine the role of Non Performing Loans (NPL) in Indonesian monetary transmission mechanism following the methodology employed in Chapter 4. In general, the results, both in Chapter 4 and 5, indicate that monetary policy contraction is not effective in the short run (three months); In the long run (60 months), money is super-neutral as proposed by Friedman (classical view) for the whole observation; while the results across three periods indicates various results in the short-run. Based on the results in Chapter 4 and 5, we investigate further the way Indonesian monetary transmission operates by examining bank portfolio behaviour across five groups of banks (foreign, mixed, private, regional and state banks) in Chapter 6. This chapter focuses on the effect of monetary policy, third party funds and NPL in affecting Indonesian banks behaviour toward loans and other liquidity assets, such as Certificate Bank Indonesia (SBI) and inter bank call money for impact, interim and total effects. We employ a dynamic mean-variance expected utility approach that enables us to calculate the multiplier responses of the choice items to unit changes in exogenous variables. The multiplier effects involve three kinds effects: impact (current), interim (ensuing periods) and total (cumulative) multipliers. The econometric technique employed in the estimation of this chapter is Full Information Maximum Likelihood (FIML). The findings confirm that monetary policy has the greatest impact effects on the banks' portfolios. In regard to the interim effects, all three factors affect those portfolios. In the long run, however, the variable NPL has the greatest influence.

However, the ability of monetary policy targets—interest rates and money supply—to stabilize an economy depends on their ability to achieve price stability. Using data from 1981 to 2018 and applying the vector error correction model, this paper seeks to determine how the changes in the inflation rate affect the ability of monetary policy tools to stabilize the Nigerian economy and stimulate investment. Empirical results suggest that the impact of the interest rates on investment depends on the level of the inflation rate.

A key aim of these policies was to boost the quantity of bank credit to the non-financial corporate and household sectors. In the previous decades, however, policy-makers had not focused on bank credit. Indeed, over the past half century, different variables were raised to prominence in the quest to achieve desired nominal GDP outcomes. This paper conducts a long-overdue horse race between the various contenders in terms of their ability to account for observed nominal GDP growth, using a half-century of UK data since 1963. Employing the ‘General-to-Specific’ methodology, an equilibrium-correction model is estimated suggesting a long-run cointegrating relationship between disaggregated real economy credit and nominal GDP. Short-term and long-term interest rates and broad money do not appear to influence nominal GDP significantly. Vector autoregression and vector error correction modelling shows the real economy credit growth variable to be strongly exogenous to nominal GDP growth. Policy-makers are hence right to finally emphasise the role of bank credit, although they need to disaggregate it and specifically target bank credit for GDP-transactions.","10.1016/j.intfin.2016.03.009","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1042443116300208","Ryan-Collins_2016_a",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,2417

We estimate a Markov switching VAR for the euro area and the US, including additionally GDP, CPI and a short-term interest rate. We find evidence for two distinct states in both regions. For the euro area, we find a regime which is correlated to the business cycle and which captures periods of very low real credit growth at the end of recessions. However, during this regime credit markets and asset price markets do not impede economic recovery. In the other regime, we do find a procyclical effect of credit and asset price shocks on GDP. Shocks in both variables explain each about 20% of GDP's forecast error variance after four years. Credit shocks have a positive effect on inflation and explain about 35% of the forecast error variance, which confirms that credit aggregates contain information about the monetary stance. The effect of asset price shocks on inflation is insignificant and their share in explaining the forecast error variance negligible. For the US, regime 1 captures periods of stable GDP growth, and low and stable inflation, combined with accelerating asset prices. We find procyclical effects of credit and asset price shocks on GDP only in regime 2. Shocks in both variables explain about the same share (20%) of GDP forecast error variance, whereby the share explained by asset price shocks is about two and a half times larger than in regime 1.

The model acknowledges that policy announcements are endogenous and summarizes policy by a single indicator. The Qual VAR allows us to study the impact of monetary policy in terms of unexpected changes in these latent variables, which we identify using sign restrictions. We show that the transmission of monetary policy impulses to the rest of the economy is similar to the transmission process in advanced economies in terms of both output growth and inflation despite a very different monetary policy framework. We find that bank loans are not sensitive to policy changes, which implies that window guidance is still a necessary policy tool. We also find that the impact of monetary policy shocks is asymmetric in terms of asset prices, that is, the asset price reactions differ in their sensitivity to tightening shocks and easing shocks, respectively. In particular, an easing of monetary conditions boosts stock prices while a tightening shock leaves stock prices unaffected. This shows that monetary policy is not a suitable tool to stabilize asset prices, which raises implications for financial stability and macroprudential policy.","10.1016/j.chieco.2017.02.006","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1043951X17300287","Chen_2017_the",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,2428

The study found out that monetary policy is significant in curbing inflation threshold in Nigeria, however the effect of monetary policy variables are weak in controlling inflation. This is as a result of the large proportion of informal sector which culminates into a high currency outside bank economy that is largely not affected by monetary policy tools. Also, non-popularity of monetary policy tools as a result of financial illiteracy accounts for its ineffectiveness. The Monetary Policy Rate (MPR) is not statistically significant which has also affected its transmission mechanism to commercial banks interest rate. This is as a result of commercial banks' excess reserves which downplay the efficacy of the MPR in affecting interest rate and money supply.

Time series data were collected from the central bank of Nigeria (CBN), the international monetary fund (IMF) and the World Bank. Firstly, a vector autoregressive model (VAR) was applied, and then the vector error correction (VEC) model. The VAR model revealed that fiscal policy distorted real GDP but died out after one year, while monetary policy had no significant impact on real GDP. Of the total government expenditure, the impact of capital expenditure was found to have a significant impact on real GDP while the impact of recurrent expenditure was insignificant. With the introduction of VEC model, the study found an unexpected shock on money supply, real effective exchange rate and taxes to have a negative permanent effect on real GDP, while an unexpected shock on recurrent expenditure and capital expenditure to have a positive effect on real GDP. Finally, the study recommends fiscal policy leadership and harmonization between the fiscal and monetary authority, with emphasis on channelling resources to where they are most needed.",NA,"https://mpra.ub.uni-muenchen.de/92811/","Bodunrin_2016_the",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,2436

Monetary policy is presumed as one of the ways to improve the situation. Likewise, the relationship between monetary policy and employment has generated controversial debates in the literature. Though its connection has been extensively studied, however, the implications of monetary policy in respect to time frame perspectives on employment and output have not been widely addressed in the literature. This study provides evidence on shock effects, long and short-run impacts of monetary policy transmission through the credit channels on output and employment in Nigeria within the period of 1981 to 2016 using the Structural Vector Autoregression and Autoregressive distributed lags (ARDL). Evidence from the forecast error shock showed that variations in monetary policy indicators affect output more than employment in the first two periods; however, it affects employment more afterwards. The ARDL results show no evidence of co-integration when output is used as the dependent variable; conversely, cointegration exists when employment is used as the dependent variable. The monetary policy indicators: money supply, bank deposit liability and interest rate are statistically and economically significant with employment in the long run. In the short run, money supply and interest rate are economically and statistically significant. The findings revealed that the Nigerian government can maximize the long-run benefits of monetary policy through the credit channels on employment. Hence, there is a need for policymakers to look beyond short-run gain and promote long-run employment via monetary policy among others.",NA,"https://www.ceeol.com/search/article-detail?id=744639","Ltd_2018_the",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,2437

The study verifies if the monetary policy, the economic activity and the maturity of the inflation targeting regime affect the supply of credit. Design/methodology/approach The paper offers a review of the literature concerning inflation targeting credibility and the transmission mechanism of monetary policy through the credit channel, it develops a theoretical model based on Bernanke and Blinder and Ferreira and it seeks empirical evidence for the Brazilian economy using ordinary least squares, generalized method of moments and vector autoregressive. Findings The estimates indicate that the supply of credit is stimulated when the economy heats up, when the monetary authority reduces the interest rate and when the credibility increases. The evidence also indicate that the supply of credit is affected by the variables of the model, economic activity and employment are affected by monetary policy and the supply of credit exerts influence on both employment and output gap. Research limitations/implications An important implication of this study is that, in inflation targeting emerging economies, such as that of Brazil, following a committed monetary policy to price stability which increases the credibility of the regime of inflation targeting and promoting macroeconomic stability represents a good strategy for improving the volume of lending to the private sector, thus stimulating economic activity and employment. What the findings do indicate is that developing credibility is crucial for emerging economies that are trying to grow, but with inflation being kept under control. Originality/value The paper presents the following theoretical and empirical contributions: the model incorporates the effect that the credibility of the inflation targeting regime has on the supply of credit and, the econometric approach provides evidence that the monetary policy, the economic activity and the process of anchoring of inflation expectations affect the supply of credit in Brazil. Moreover, the paper finds evidence that the credit channel acts as a transmission mechanism of monetary policy to the economy.","10.1108/JES-07-2011-0086","https://www.emerald.com/insight/content/doi/10.1108/JES-07-2011-0086/full/html","Caldas Montes_2013_credibility",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,2440

We pin down key parameters of the model by matching impulse responses obtained from a vector autoregression on time series for the US relative to the euro area. Our estimation procedure yields plausible parameter values and suggests a strong role for strategic complementarities. Counterfactual simulations show that openness alters monetary transmission significantly.

This evidence is further supported by the results of a model that uses output data at the sectoral level: when more disaggregated data are employed, the transition between regimes is more abrupt.

Short term responses are analyzed by studying the mechanisms through which macroeconomic surprises affect fundamental stock prices in a context of both symmetric and asymmetric information. This information structure is related to the degree of homogeneity in the interpretation of a public announcement. Homogeneous assessments relate macro surprises with jumps. Heterogeneous ones introduce an additional order flow component. Long term effects are analyzed by investigating the macroeconomic determinants of unconditional volatility. This is accomplished by modeling equity volatilities as a combination of macroeconomic effects and time series dynamics. The resulting framework allows the high frequency financial data to be linked with the low frequency macro data.

This paper investigates heterogeneity in the market assessment of public macroeconomic announcements by exploring (jointly) two main mechanisms through which macroeconomic news might enter stock prices: Instantaneous fundamental news impacts consistent with the asset pricing view of symmetric information, and permanent order flow effects consistent with a microstructure view of asymmetric information related to heterogeneous interpretation of public news. Theoretical motivation and empirical evidence for the operation of both mechanisms are presented. Significant instantaneous news impacts are detected for news related to real activity (including employment), investment, inflation, and monetary policy; however, it is also found significant order flow effects on employment announcement days.

High frequency return volatility is specified to be the product of a slow moving deterministic component, represented by an exponential spline, and a unit GARCH. This deterministic component is the unconditional volatility, which is then estimated for nearly 50 countries over various sample periods of daily data. Macroeconomic determinants of unconditional volatility are investigated. It is found that volatility in macroeconomic factors such as GDP growth, inflation and short term interest rate are important explanatory variables that increase volatility. There is evidence that high inflation and slow growth of output are also positive determinants. Volatility is higher for emerging markets and for markets with small number of listings and market capitalization, but also for large economies. The model allows long horizon forecasts of volatility to depend on macroeconomic developments, and allows forecasts of the volatility to be expected in a newly opened market. News, Announcements and Stock Market Volatility Dynamics. This paper examines announcement and news effects on stock market volatility in the context of public disclosure of information regarding fundamental macroeconomic variables, monetary policy decisions, and earnings. The return distribution is parametrized using a jump Poisson-Gaussian model with time varying arrival intensity, and a GARCH model. Information surprises and announcements affect conditional volatility through a non-linear channel described by the jump intensity. We find that the day of the announcement, per se, has little impact on jump intensities. However, one exception is the day of employment releases where the jump intensity is significantly large. In contrast, when the surprise component of the announcement is incorporated in the model, inflation shocks show persistent effects and monetary policy shocks show short-lived effects. The jump model provides evidence of heterogeneous volatility persistence and asymmetric effects between positive and negative shocks from different types of news releases.",NA,"https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=eoh&AN=0940986&site=ehost-live","Rangel_2006_stock",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,2484

I show that the higher the elasticity of foreign demand, the lower the contraction in output--leading, at the extreme, to the possibility of an expansion. Interest rate rules reacting to inflation and output stabilize the output more than a fixed exchange rate regime. Low credibility and the risk of loose policy imply increased trade-offs, stronger contraction of the economy, and higher interest rates. The second essay builds on the framework presented in the first essay to consider how monetary policy should react to a sudden stop of capital inflows. Optimal monetary policy boosts export revenues through the depreciation of the domestic currency in order to minimize the impact on the domestic economy but a hike in interest rates and a recession cannot be avoided. For the relevant parameterizations, optimal policy is fairly well approximated by a flexible targeting rule, in which a combination of domestic prices, exchange rate and output is stabilized. Strict exchange rate targeting achieves low welfare levels relative to other simple rules based on inflation and output in which the exchange rate is taken into account but not fully fixed. The third essay, coauthored with Daria Finocchiaro, estimates a small open economy model for Sweden. We account for a regime change in monetary policy, from an exchange rate target zone to flexible exchange rates and inflation targeting. Results suggest that monetary policy reacted primarily to exchange rate deviations from central parity under the target zone, but inflation and output were not neglected. In the inflation targeting regime the interest rate reacted mainly to inflation. Expectations of realignment and risk premium volatility were the main sources of volatility in the target zone period. In the inflation targeting period, monetary shocks were important in the short run but in the long run labor supply and preference shocks are relatively more important. Shocks to foreign variables were more destabilizing in the target zone period than in the inflation targeting regime.",NA,"https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=eoh&AN=0940830&site=ehost-live","Curdia_2007_essays",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,2485

Overall, our results are mixed. Dynamic business cycle and inflation correlations between CEECs and the euro area are, on average, lower than between individual EMU members and the euro area, but they are higher than for some small peripheral EMU countries. This is confirmed by our other measure, variance shares of output and inflation explained by common euro-area factors. The proliferation of euro-area shocks to the CEECs does not differ significantly from the propagation to EMU countries in most cases. Based on our counterfactual experiment, we do not find significant stabilizing or destabilizing effects through a common monetary policy and fixed exchange rates. We also find that business cycle synchronization between CEECs and between most CEECs and the euro area will increase.

Second, although the relative role of the credit channel has declined, it remains, on average, the most important transmission channel (42%).

Methodology: Annual data sourced from Central Bank of Nigeria Statistical Bulletin covering the period 1971 to 2018. The data collected were analyzed using Ordinary Least Square method. The study also conducted the unit root and cointegration test to ascertain the fitness of the model. Result: Long-run relationship exists among the variables and that some explanatory variables (Monetary policy rate, Interest rate, Investment to productive sector) presents a positive but non-significant effect on economic growth while real exchange rate has a negative impact on economic growth in Nigeria. However, monetary supply, which is another explanatory variable has a positive significant effect on economic growth. Conclusion: On the overall, monetary policy is found to explain about 89% of the changes in economic growth in Nigeria. Unique contribution: The study includes monetary policy rate which serves as the main tool of monetary policy targets and as well use GDP growth rate which is believed to be an adequate measure of economic growth as against ordinary GDP. This study also replaced external reserves and output of industrial production with investment since investment is theoretically postulated to have a direct influence from interest rates (both lending and deposit), which CBN monetary policy rates have a direct influence on.

We find that price stability measured by inflation bands of inflation below 6 per cent leads to a lower NAIRU compared to when the inflation bands are not considered. Expansionary monetary policy lowers the unemployment rate above the NAIRU. Evidence shows that expansionary monetary policy lowers the unemployment rate and these effects are amplified by high GDP growth, investment growth, credit growth, the exchange rate appreciation and unit labour costs below the trend growth (alternatively, positive labour productivity shocks).

Using a HAVAR model (Fratantoni and Schuh 2003) with only two sectors, manufacturing and trade, we discover structural changes that reduced comovement of sales and inventory investment both within and between industries. As a result, the response of aggregate output to all types of shocks is dampened.

The testing is applied using the Johansen procedure based on a factor-augmented vector error correction model (FAVEC model), which is augmented by the factor of the macroeconomic environment, for the period from January 2003 to December 2010. Factor analysis is used to estimate the macroeconomic environment factor, which reflects developments in domestic economic activity based on a large number of time series. The monetary policy indicator, which adequately represents the complexity of the CNB measures, is also defined. The paper confirms the existence of a long-run relation between household loans, the macroeconomic environment factor and the monetary policy indicator. At the same time, no such a relation was confirmed for corporate loans. This is probably due to the fact that, in contrast to households, enterprises raised substantial funds from other financing sources (particularly abroad) in preceding years, and not only from commercial banks. This has limited the impact of monetary policy on corporate loans. Impulse response functions estimated on the basis of the FAVEC model showed that a restrictive monetary policy shock leads to a decrease in household loans, while a positive shock in the macroeconomic environment factor, which generally represents an increase in overall economic activity, has a favourable impact on bank loans to households. The identification of the long-run relation yields the conclusion that CNB measures were justified; without them credit growth would certainly have been larger, which means that external imbalances in the Croatian economy would have been worse. On the other hand, the recent crisis and the halt in bank lending coupled with the weak credit channel of monetary policy in Croatia limited the impact of incentives for credit growth.

Primarily, the research will concentrate on the interactions between interest rates, inflation, money supply and growth in GDP, which will serve as the instrument for measuring economic growth. Design/methodology/approach The research will apply quantitative analysis to determine the relationship between GDP growth and monetary policy instruments, particularly interest rate, money supply and level of inflation. Given the advancement and achievement in econometric analysis and computer software creation, the least-squares estimates analysis will be used to investigate the relationship and significance between these variables. Findings It is observed that relationship between economic growth and inflation is positive. This entails that a 1 percent change in inflation will result in a 77 percent increase in the level of economic growth in this economy. The linkage between economic growth and interest rates has also been observed to be positive. A positive nexus can be observed between economic growth and money supply. The coefficient value of 0.02 for money supply growth shows that it has the smallest effect on economic growth amongst the variables tested in the model. Research limitations/implications Based on the findings of this study, the following recommendations can be made, which could serve as policies instruments for Malaysian economic development. This does not mean that the findings can be generalized for other developing economies. Practical implications Observations from the test for economic application significance are based on the signs of the parameters. It was observed that inflation, interest rates and money supply all have a positive relationship with economic growth, which is in line with the a priori expectations. This means that monetary policy has positively affected the economic growth. Social implications The results of the OLS analysis reveal that the monetary policy instruments used for the model demonstrated that monetary policy has a positive relationship with economic growth in Malaysia. A breakdown of the individual monetary policy instruments shows that the interest rate, inflation and money supply all have individual positive relationships with economic growth. Originality/value A positive relationship exists between economic growth in Malaysia and all selected monetary instruments, namely, inflation, money supply and interest rate. The results show that the results show that inflation, interest rate and money supply will cause the economy to grow but their contribution to the developments is affected from other policy instruments which are used by the governments.","10.1108/JEAS-03-2017-0013","https://doi.org/10.1108/JEAS-03-2017-0013","Akalpler_2018_does",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,2502

Therefore, this paper aims to analyse the effectiveness of monetary policy transmission channels in restraining inflation in the case of Vietnam for 2001-2015. The use of a Vector Error Correction Model yields evidence that credit growth is the key determinant of high inflation. Additionally, the results suggest the interest rate channel has a perverse effect on inflation in the long run, which means that the inflation rate increases with the policy rate. There is also significant short-run causal relationship from credit growth to inflation, and from the policy rate to inflation. However, empirical results fail to confirm the existence of a relationship between the exchange rate channel and inflation in both short run and long run.","10.1080/13547860.2018.1429199","https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=eoh&AN=1712808&site=ehost-live","Tran_2018_the",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,2505

Using a Bayesian Structural VAR, we identify the interest rate shocks as a measure of the stance of the U.S. monetary policy and evaluate their impacts on different types of commodity prices. The empirical evidence suggests that a U.S. monetary contraction has a negative and significant effect on the aggregate commodity prices, which takes place with a substantial lag (i.e., eight quarters after the shock). However, the aggregate response masks the existence of significant heterogeneity in the responses of the different types of commodities. More specifically, a positive interest rate (contractionary) shock leads to: i) an initial increase in the prices of non-fuel commodities, which later reverts path and becomes negative (as in the case of the prices of agricultural raw materials); ii) a positive and persistent rise in the food prices; iii) a fall in the beverage prices; and iv) a persistent reduction in the prices of metals and the prices of fuel (energy) prices.",NA,NA,"Hammoudeh_NA_us",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,2506

Some Evidence from Macedonia.",2015,NA,NA,NA,"report","Surplus liquidity in the banking system changes the monetary transmission mechanism, reducing the effectiveness of the traditional instrument, the interest rate. In this paper we examine the real effects of several monetary-policy instruments in Macedonia, an economy characterized by surplus liquidity. We use regime-switching Vector Autoregressions and track the responses of different economic activity indicators to changes in the monetary policy instruments. Our findings suggest that the interest rate channel is weakly effective in Macedonia. The responses to the other instruments are not very sizeable, either, but are significant. This implies that monetary policy can affect economic activity through the reserve requirement and the offered amount of central bank bills. These findings have implications for both the analysis and the conduct of monetary policy in economies with surplus liquidity. Regarding analysis, the implication is that the traditional approach, which considers only the role of the interest rate, is likely to lead to wrong conclusions. Regarding conduct, the implication is that monetary authorities, besides on the price impact of the interest rate, should additionally rely on the reserve requirement and other available instruments producing volume impact.",NA,"https://www.econstor.eu/handle/10419/173712","Jovanovic_2015_can",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,2508

The Puzzle of Rising U.S. Unemployment Persistence",2013,"Brookings Papers on Economic Activity",NA,NA,"journalArticle","The persistence of U.S. unemployment has risen with each of the last three recessions, raising the specter that future U.S. recessions might look more like the ""Eurosclerosis"" experience of the 1980s than like the traditional V-shaped recoveries of the past. We revisit several explanations for this rising persistence, decomposing them into three possible sources: business cycle fluctuations, changing policy responses, and propagation mechanisms. First, we find that financial shocks do not systematically lead to more persistent unemployment than monetary policy shocks, casting doubt on the hypothesis that different drivers of business cycles are the primary explanation. Second, we find that changing monetary and fiscal policy responses account for approximately one-third of the rise in unemployment persistence. Third, after examining three propagation mechanisms, we find that jointly they cannot account for any rising persistence of unemployment. The three propagation mechanisms we focus on--declining labor mobility, changing age structures, and the decline in trust among Americans--are consistent with four other cyclical patterns that have evolved since the early 1980s: a rising cyclicality in long-term unemployment, lower regional convergence after downturns, rising cyclicality in disability claims, and missing disinflation. We exploit regional variation in labor market outcomes across Western Europe and North America during 1970-91 to assess the predictive capacity of each propagation mechanism for unemployment persistence. In summary, two-thirds of the rise in unemployment persistence is unexplained.",NA,"https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=eoh&AN=1410282&site=ehost-live","Coibion_2013_amerisclerosis",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,2509

In the study, the real gross domestic product and the exchange rate are used to proxy economic performance and economic stabilisation respectively while fiscal policy is captured with deficit finance and government expenditure. Also, the broad money supply and monetary policy rate are used as proxies of monetary policy. The study obtains country-specific results using the fully modified ordinary least squares technique and findings show that monetary policy has insignificant effect on economic performance in Nigeria and the Gambia, but has significant impact in Ghana while fiscal policy significantly enhances economic performance in Nigeria and Gambia, but is insignificant in Ghana. Result also confirms that monetary policy significantly drives economic stabilisation in Nigeria and the Gambia, but insignificantly in Ghana while fiscal policy has insignificant impact on economic stabilisation in Ghana and Gambia, but significant in Nigeria. Thus, we conclude that fiscal policy is relatively more important in stimulating economic performance in Nigeria and Gambia while monetary policy is relatively more important in determining economic performance in Ghana. For economic stabilisation, both fiscal and monetary policies are important in Nigeria, both are ineffective in Ghana, while monetary policy is more important in the Gambia.

One of them is to change price index in measurement of inflation. In this study, we investigate the suitability of an alternative price index in inflation targeting regime instead of consumer price index in Turkish economy. In this regard, we employ the producer price index instead of consumer price index in order to investigate the suitability of Frankel's policy proposals. The empirical results, obtained from conventional VAR analysis suggest that the impact of producer price on the inflation rate is in the short term and it is weak. Similarly, MS-VAR analysis by utilizing the monthly data for the period 2003M2-2013M6, show that there is not a significant impact of producer price on the inflation rate during the expansionary period and it is also possible to talk about the effect of supply side shocks in the recession regime. Therefore, the consumer price index seems to be an appropriate instrument to target inflation rate, but the producer price index should also take into account to target inflation during the recessionary period in Turkey.",NA,"https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=eoh&AN=1620221&site=ehost-live","Kayhan_2015_is",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,2513

It is shown that shocks to Germany's macroeconomic fundamentals have a significant impact on Greece's inflation rates, industrial production, and interest rates. Our empirical results indicate that the root cause of the Greek debt crisis emanates from imbalances in its balance of payment, mainly in its current account, losses in competitiveness vis-a-vis Germany, and the lack of nominal adjustment measures through monetary policy due to Greece's membership in the Eurozone. We argue, in the absence of nominal adjustment mechanisms, Greece will probably have to go through prolonged deflationary episodes in order to enhance its competitiveness, produce a positive current account, reduce its budget deficits and public debt, and reverse capital outflows. We also argue, in the absence of an effective monetary policy, countries members in a monetary union running large budget and current account deficits maybe more prone to a Greek debt type crisis.",NA,"https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=eoh&AN=1706839&site=ehost-live","Neaime_2018_the",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,2514

A number of researchers have suggested that loose monetary policy during the first half of the 2000s was a primary cause of the substantial run-up in house prices in many countries. However, using a common statistical approach, we find that monetary policy was not the main factor. That should not be surprising: Although low interest rates raise house prices, the increase in prices during the mid-2000s was much larger than the historical relationship between the two variables would suggest. Instead, we investigate further the link between the marked loosening in terms and standards for mortgage credit and the most rapid increases in house prices. This link provides some evidence for a story where credit provision and the demand for housing fed on each other and helped spur the housing boom.
