# Documentation of the full text screening process

After completion of the abstract screening, [potentially relevant studies](link-to-excel-files) ___[UPDATE THE LINK TO EXCEL FILES]___ — i.e. relevant according to at least one screener based on abstract — were full-text screened in random order by a team of five researchers. Each potentially relevant study was screened independently by one researcher. Notes on (non-)eligibility were stored for each study ([see here](link-to-excel-files) ___[UPDATE THE LINK TO EXCEL FILES]___). If all eligibility criteria applied, the study’s data was extracted according to our codebook and [detailed variable definitions and coding instructions](https://github.com/META-CMP/data/issues/12). Study characteristics and study-internal moderator variables were coded in a [JSON file for each eligible study](data/full_text_screening/JSON_files). The coders met on a weekly basis. Unsure cases were discussed until resolved and the variable definitions and coding instructions were updated regularly to ensure a consistent coding. After completion of the initial round of full text screening, more than 10% of entries were double-checked and corrected to identify systematic coding errors or inconsistencies in data coding between the researchers. These systematic errors or inconsistencies were then discussed and corrected across studies.
