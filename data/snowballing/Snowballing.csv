Currently available estimators that are designed for this context depend upon the choice of a lag truncation parameter and a weighting scheme. Results in the literature provide a condition on the growth rate of the lag truncation parameter as T \rightarrow \infty that is sufficient for consistency. No results are available, however, regarding the choice of lag truncation parameter for a fixed sample size, regarding data-dependent automatic lag truncation parameters, or regarding the choice of weighting scheme. In consequence, available estimators are not entirely operational and the relative merits of the estimators are unknown. This paper addresses these problems. The asymptotic truncated mean squared errors of estimators in a given class are determined and compared. Asymptotically optimal kernel/weighting scheme and bandwidth/lag truncation parameters are obtained using an asymptotic truncated mean squared error criterion. Using these results, data-dependent automatic bandwidth/lag truncation parameters are introduced. The finite sample properties of the estimators are analyzed via Monte Carlo simulation.","1991","2023-11-28 15:51:32","2023-11-28 15:51:32","","817-858","","3","59","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

One possibility is to use surveys that follow the same households over time, but such data are rare and they typically have small sample sizes and face significant measurement issues. An alternative approach is to use the accounting identity that total household spending is equal to income plus capital gains minus the change in wealth over the period. The goal of this paper is to examine the advantages and difficulties of using this accounting identity to construct a population panel data with information on household expenditure. To derive such measures of consumption expenditure, we combine several data sources from Norway over the period 1994–2014. This allows us to link tax records on income and wealth to other administrative data with information on financial and real estate transactions. Using this data, we derive household expenditure from the accounting identity, before assessing the sensitivity of this measure of consumption expenditure to the assumptions made and the data used. We then compare our measures of household expenditure to those reported in expenditure surveys and to the aggregates from national accounts. We also illustrate the research opportunities arising from the derived measures of consumption expenditure through two applications: the first is an examination of how relative wage movements among birth cohorts and education groups affected the distribution of household expenditure, while the second is a study of the transmission of income shocks to household consumption.","2020","2023-11-28 15:51:32","2023-11-28 15:51:32","","104163-NA","","NA","189","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This paper examines the magnitude of these informational problems using Taylor's rule as an example. I demonstrate that the real-time policy recommendations differ considerably from those obtained with the ex post revised data and are revised substantially even a year after the relevant quarter. Further, I show that estimated policy reaction functions obtained using the ex post revised data can yield misleading descriptions of historical policy.

However, little is known about the magnitude of the Federal Reserve's reaction to the stock market. One reason is that it is difficult to estimate the policy reaction because of the simultaneous response of equity prices to interest rate changes. This paper uses an identification technique based on the heteroskedasticity of stock market returns to identify the reaction of monetary policy to the stock market. The results indicate that monetary policy reacts significantly to stock market movements, with a 5% rise (fall) in the S&P 500 index increasing the likelihood of a 25 basis point tightening (easing) by about a half. This reaction is roughly of the magnitude that would be expected from estimates of the impact of stock market movements on aggregate demand. Thus, it appears that the Federal Reserve systematically responds to stock price movements only to the extent warranted by their impact on the macroeconomy.","2003","2023-11-28 15:51:33","2023-11-28 15:51:33","","639-669","","2","118","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Furthermore, under quadratic loss, commercial forecasts seem to have information not contained in those forecasts. To investigate the cause of this apparent irrationality, this paper recovers the loss function implied by Federal Reserve's inflation forecasts. The results suggest that the cost of having inflation above an implicit time-varying target was larger than the cost of having inflation below it for the period since Volcker, and that the opposite was true for the pre-Volcker era. Once these asymmetries are taken into account, the Federal Reserve's inflation forecasts are found to be rational.","2008","2023-11-28 15:51:33","2023-11-28 15:51:33","","1415-1427","","8","55","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

I find that both forward guidance and LSAPs had substantial and highly statistically significant effects on medium-term Treasury yields, stock prices, and exchange rates, comparable in magnitude to the effects of the federal funds rate before the ZLB. Forward guidance was more effective than LSAPs at moving short-term Treasury yields, while LSAPs were more effective than forward guidance and the federal funds rate at moving longer-term Treasury yields, corporate bond yields, and interest rate uncertainty. However, the effects of forward guidance were not very persistent, with a half-life of 1–4 months. The effects of LSAPs seem to be more persistent.

It then identifies six significant, discrete announcements in the course of Operation Twist that could have had a major effect on financial markets and shows that four did have statistically significant effects. The cumulative effect of these six announcements on longer-term Treasury yields is highly statistically significant but moderate, amounting to about 15 basis points (bp). This estimate is consistent both with time-series analysis undertaken not long after the event and with the lower end of empirical estimates of Treasury supply effects in the literature. The effects of Operation Twist on long-term agency and corporate bond yields are also statistically significant but smaller, about 13 bp for agency securities and 2 to 4 bp for corporates.

An Empirical Analysis","European Economic Review","","","10.1016/j.euroecorev.2017.07.008","","The UK has experienced a dramatic increase in earnings and income inequality over the past four decades. We use detailed micro level information to construct quarterly historical measures of inequality from 1969 to 2012. We investigate whether monetary policy shocks played a role in explaining this increase in inequality. We find that contractionary monetary policy shocks lead to an increase in earnings, income and consumption inequality and contribute to their fluctuation. The response of income and consumption at different quantiles suggests that contractionary policy has a larger negative effect on low income households and those that consume the least when compared to those at the top of the distribution. Our evidence also suggests that the policy of quantitative easing may have contributed to the increase in inequality over the Great Recession.","2017","2023-11-28 15:51:35","2023-11-28 15:51:35","","410-423","","NA","98","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We show that, when investors must learn about expected cash f lows, empirical tests can find patterns in the data that differ from those perceived by rational investors. Returns might appear predictable to an econometrician, or appear to deviate from the Capital Asset Pricing Model, but investors can neither perceive nor exploit this predictability. Returns may also appear excessively volatile even though prices react efficiently to cash-f low news. We conclude that parameter uncertainty can be important for characterizing and testing market efficiency. THERE IS MUCH EVIDENCE THAT STOCK RETURNS are predictable. At the aggregate level, variables such as interest rates, financial ratios, and the default premium appear to forecast stock returns ~e.g., Fama and French ~1989! and Lewellen ~2001!!. Further, LeRoy and Porter ~1981! and Shiller ~1981! argue that price volatility cannot be explained solely by changes in dividends, providing indirect evidence that stock returns are predictable. At the firm level, Fama and French ~1992, 1996! and Jegadeesh and Titman ~1993! show that size, book-to-market, and past returns together explain much of the crosssectional variation in average returns. There seems little doubt that expected returns vary both cross-sectionally and over time. The interpretation of predictability is more contentious. The empirical results are potentially consistent with either market efficiency or mispricing. In general terms, market efficiency implies that prices fully ref lect available information. To formalize this idea for empirical testing, Fama ~1976! distinguishes between the probability distribution of returns perceived by “the market,” based on whatever information investors view as relevant, and the true distribution of returns conditional on all information. The market is said to be ~informationally! efficient if these distributions are the same.

Compared with the standard default-risk indicators, our credit spread index is a robust predictor of economic activity at both the short- and longer-term horizons. Using an empirical framework, we decompose the index into a predictable component that captures the available firm-specific information on expected defaults and a residual component—the excess bond premium—which we argue likely reflects variation in the price of default risk rather than variation in the risk of default. Our results indicate that the predictive content of credit spreads for economic activity is due primarily to movements in the excess bond premium. Innovations in the excess bond premium that are orthogonal to the current state of the economy are shown to lead to significant declines in economic activity and equity prices. We also show that a deterioration in the creditworthiness of broker-dealers—key financial intermediaries in the corporate cash market—causes an increase in the excess bond premium. These findings support the notion that a rise in the excess bond premium represents a reduction in the e!ective risk-bearing capacity of the financial sector and, as a result, a contraction in the supply of credit with significant adverse consequences for the macroeconomy.","2012","2023-11-28 15:51:37","2023-11-28 15:51:37","","1692-1720","","4","102","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

While there are good public policy reasons to evaluate the quality of such forecasts, up until now, the most common approach has been to ignore their conditional nature and apply standard forecast efficiency tests. In this paper we derive tests for the efficiency of conditional forecasts. Intuitively, these tests involve implicit estimates of the degree to which the conditioning path is counterfactual and the magnitude of the policy feedback over the forecast horizon. We apply the tests to the Greenbook forecast and the Bank of England’s inflation report forecast, finding some evidence of forecast inefficiency. Nonetheless, we argue that the conditional nature of the forecasts made by central banks represents a substantial impediment to the analysis of their quality—stronger assumptions are needed and forecast inefficiency may go undetected for longer than would be the case if central banks were instead to report unconditional forecasts.","2008","2023-11-28 15:51:37","2023-11-28 15:51:37","","293-303","","2","146","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

First, we establish general rank conditions for global identification of both overidentified and exactly identified models. Second, we show that these conditions can be checked as a simple matrix- filling exercise and that they apply to a wide class of identifying restrictions, including linear and certain nonlinear restrictions.

An exogenous immigration shock lowers unemployment (even among native workers), has a small positive effect on prices and on public finances, no impact on house prices and household credit, and a negative effect on productivity driven by a large decline in capital intensity.","2019","2023-11-28 15:51:39","2023-11-28 15:51:39","","1-19","","16","34","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We combine random audits - the key source used to study tax evasion so far- with new micro-data leaked from large offshore financial institutions - HSBC Switzerland (""Swiss leaks"") and Mossack Fonseca (""Panama Papers"")|matched to population-wide wealth records in Norway, Sweden, and Denmark. We find that tax evasion rises sharply with wealth, a phenomenon random audits fail to capture. On average about 3% of personal taxes are evaded in Scandinavia, but this figure rises to close to 30% in the top 0.01% of the wealth distribution, a group that includes households with more than $45 million in net wealth. A simple model of the supply of tax evasion services can explain why evasion rises steeply with wealth. Taking tax evasion into account increases the rise in inequality seen in tax data since the 1970s markedly, highlighting the need to move beyond tax data to capture income and wealth at the top, even in countries where tax compliance is generally high. We also find that after reducing tax evasion - by using tax amnesties - tax evaders do not legally avoid taxes more. This result suggests that fighting tax evasion can be an effective way to collect more tax revenue from the very wealthy.","2019","2023-11-28 15:51:39","2023-11-28 15:51:39","","2073-2103","","6","109","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This paper argues that these puzzles derive from an identification of monetary policy that is inappropriate for such economies. To remedy this, it is proposed that a structural model be estimated to explicitly account for the features of the small open economy. Such a model is applied to Canada with tightly estimated results overall. The dynamic responses to the identified monetary policy shock are consistent with standard theory and highlight the exchange rate as a transmission mechanism.","1997","2023-11-28 15:51:40","2023-11-28 15:51:40","","433-448","","3","39","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We find that a shift to anti-inflationary policy led, on average, to a rise in the unemployment rate of two percentage points, and that this effect is highly statistically significant and robust to a variety of changes in specification. We reach three other major conclusions. First, the real effects of these monetary disturbances are highly persistent. Second, the six shocks that we identify account for a considerable fraction of postwar economic fluctuations.

The trend, which has been manifested in both freer movement of goods and increased mobility of capital, has been stimulated by the dismantling of trade and exchange controls in Europe, the gradual erosion of the real burden of tariff protection, and the stability, unparalleled since 1914, of the exchange rates. The international economic climate has changed in the direction of financial integration and this has important implications for economic policy. My paper concerns the theoretical and practical implications of the increased mobility of capital. In order to present my conclusions in the simplest possible way, and to bring the implications for policy into sharpest relief, I assume the extreme degree of mobility that prevails when a country cannot maintain an interest rate different from the general level prevailing abroad. This assumption will overstate the case but it has the merit of posing a stereotype towards which international financial relations seem to be heading. At the same time it might be argued that the assumption is not far from the truth in those financial centres, of which Zurich, Amsterdam, and Brussels may be taken as examples, where the authorities already recognize their lessening ability to dominate money market conditions and insulate them from foreign influences. It should also have a high degree of relevance to a country like Canada whose financial markets are dominated to a great degree by the vast New York market.","1963","2023-11-28 15:51:41","2023-11-28 15:51:41","","475-485","","4","29","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Third, returns are positively correlated with wealth. Fourth, returns have an individual permanent component that accounts for 60% of the explained variation. Fifth, for wealth below the 95th percentile, the individual permanent component accounts for the bulk of the correlation between returns and wealth; the correlation at the top reflects both compensation for risk and the correlation of wealth with the individual permanent component.

(i) We develop a simpler analytical characterization and numerical algorithm for Bayesian inference in structural vector autoregressions (VARs) that can be used for models that are overidentified, just-identified, or underidentified. (ii) We analyze the asymptotic properties of Bayesian inference and show that in the underidentified case, the asymptotic posterior distribution of contemporaneous coefficients in an n-variable VAR is confined to the set of values that orthogonalize the population variance–covariance matrix of ordinary least squares residuals, with the height of the posterior proportional to the height of the prior at any point within that set. For example, in a bivariate VAR for supply and demand identified solely by sign restrictions, if the population correlation between the VAR residuals is positive, then even if one has available an infinite sample of data, any inference about the demand elasticity is coming exclusively from the prior distribution. (iii) We provide analytical characterizations of the informative prior distributions for impulse-response functions that are implicit in the traditional sign-restriction approach to VARs, and we note, as a special case of result (ii), that the influence of these priors does not vanish asymptotically.

Saving rates net of capital gains (""net saving rates"") are approximately constant across the wealth distribution. However, saving rates including capital gains (""gross saving rates"") increase markedly with wealth. The proximate explanation is that wealthier households own assets that experience persistent capital gains which they hold onto instead of selling them off to consume (""saving by holding""). These joint patterns for net and gross saving rates challenge canonical models of household wealth accumulation. They are instead consistent with theories in which time-varying discount rates or portfolio adjustment frictions keep households from realizing capital gains.

In this environment, the indirect effects of an unexpected cut in interest rates, which operate through a general equilibrium increase in labor demand, far outweigh direct effects such as intertemporal substitution. This finding is in stark contrast to small- and medium-scale Representative Agent New Keynesian (RANK) economies, where the substitution channel drives virtually all of the transmission from interest rates to consumption.

The main idea is to construct a prior class that removes the source of the disagreement: the need to specify an unrevisable prior for the structural parameter given the reduced‐form parameter. The corresponding class of posteriors can be summarized by reporting the ‘posterior lower and upper probabilities’ of a given event and/or the ‘set of posterior means’ and the associated ‘robust credible region’. We show that the set of posterior means is a consistent estimator of the true identified set and the robust credible region has the correct frequentist asymptotic coverage for the true identified set if it is convex. Otherwise, the method provides posterior inference about the convex hull of the identified set.

Their effect on the price of oil, however, has been modest. For example, the cumulative effect of the SPR releases after the invasion of Kuwait in 1990 was a reduction of $2 per barrel in the real price of oil after 7 months. Whereas emergency drawdowns tend to lower the real price of oil, we find that exchanges tend to raise the real price of oil in the long run.

The exposure to aggregate consumption growth of households in the top 10 percent of the consumption distribution in the CEX is about five times that of households in the bottom 80 percent. Given real aggregate per capita consumption growth about 3 percentage points less than its historical mean during the past year, these figures predict that the ratio of consumption of the top 10 percent to the bottom 80 percent has fallen by about 15 percentage points (relative to trend). Using income data from Piketty and Saez (2003), we show that the income (especially the wage income) of rich households is more exposed to aggregate fluctuations, so their higher income exposure is a likely contributor to their higher consumption exposure. Finally, we find a striking change in the exposure of the incomes of high-income households: prior to the early 1980's, the incomes of high-income households were not more exposed to aggregate fluctuations. Thus, while high-income households currently bear an inordinately large share of aggregate fluctuations, this is a recent occurrence.","2009","2023-11-28 15:51:44","2023-11-28 15:51:44","","399-405","","2","99","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We distinguish between Odyssean forward guidance, which publicly commits the FOMC to a future action, and Delphic forward guidance, which merely forecasts macroeconomic performance and likely monetary policy actions. Others have shown how forward guidance that commits the central bank to keeping rates at zero for longer than conditions would otherwise warrant can provide monetary easing, if the public trusts it. We empirically characterize the responses of asset prices and private macroeconomic forecasts to FOMC forward guidance, both before and since the recent financial crisis. Our results show that the FOMC has extensive experience successfully telegraphing its intended adjustments to evolving conditions, so communication difficulties do not present an insurmountable barrier to Odyssean forward guidance.

Typically, the motivation given for the clustering adjustments is that unobserved components in outcomes for units within clusters are correlated. However, because correlation may occur across more than one dimension, this motivation makes it difficult to justify why researchers use clustering in some dimensions, such as geographic, but not others, such as age cohorts or gender. It also makes it difficult to explain why one should not cluster with data from a randomized experiment. In this paper, we argue that clustering is in essence a design problem, either a sampling design or an experimental design issue. It is a sampling design issue if sampling follows a two stage process where in the first stage, a subset of clusters were sampled randomly from a population of clusters, while in the second stage, units were sampled randomly from the sampled clusters. In this case the clustering adjustment is justified by the fact that there are clusters in the population that we do not see in the sample. Clustering is an experimental design issue if the assignment is correlated within the clusters. We take the view that this second perspective best fits the typical setting in economics where clustering adjustments are used. This perspective allows us to shed new light on three questions: (i) when should one adjust the standard errors for clustering, (ii) when is the conventional adjustment for clustering appropriate, and (iii) when does the conventional adjustment of the standard errors matter.","2017","2023-11-28 15:51:44","2023-11-28 15:51:44","","NA-NA","","NA","NA","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Financial market uncertainty has quantitatively large negative consequences for several measures of real activity including employment, production, and orders.

The central idea consists in estimating local projections at each period of interest rather than extrapolating into increasingly distant horizons from a given model, as it is done with vector autoregressions (VAR). The advantages of local projections are numerous: (1) they can be estimated by simple regression techniques with standard regression packages; (2) they are more robust to misspecification; (3) joint or point-wise analytic inference is simple; and (4) they easily accommodate experimentation with highly non-linear and flexible specifications that may be impractical in a multivariate context.

However, answering questions of economic interest often requires knowing the effects of a 'unit' shock. For example, central bankers want to answer questions like 'what are the effects of a 100 basis point increase in the policy rate?' The problem is that set-identifying restrictions do not always rule out the possibility that a variable does not react contemporaneously to its own shock. As a consequence, identified sets for the impulse responses to unit shocks may be unbounded, which implies that set-identifying restrictions may be extremely uninformative. Simply assuming that responses are non-zero turns out to be an arbitrary and unsatisfactory solution. I argue that it is therefore important to communicate about the extent to which the identified set may be unbounded, since this tells us about the informativeness of the identifying restrictions, and I develop tools to facilitate this. I explain how to draw useful posterior inferences about impulse responses when identified sets are unbounded with positive probability. I illustrate the empirical relevance of these issues by estimating the response of US output to a 100 basis point federal funds rate shock under different sets of identifying restrictions. Some restrictions are very uninformative about the effects of a 100 basis point shock.

We first show that even without additional restrictions, the data alone are often quite informative about the quantitatively important shocks that have occurred in the sample. We propose shrinking the set of solutions by imposing two types of inequality constraints on the shocks. The first restricts the sign and possibly magnitude of the shocks during unusual episodes in history. The second restricts the correlation between the shocks and variables external to the SVAR.

We link this information at the individual level to high quality administrative records containing information about mortgage borrowing as well as savings in various financial instruments. We find that the marginal propensity to increase mortgage debt is 3-5% of unanticipated home value gains. We find no adjustment to other components of the portfolio, and we find that mortgage extraction leads to an increase in spending. The effect is driven by young households with high loan-to-value ratios which is consistent with the effect being driven by collateral constraints. Further, we find that the effect is driven by home owners who actively take out a new mortgage. The price effect is magnified among FRM borrowers who have an incentive to refinance their loans to lock in a lower market rate.

Using consumer theory, I show that redistribution has aggregate effects whenever marginal propensities to consume (MPCs) covary, across households, with balancesheet exposures to aggregate shocks. Unexpected inflation gives rise to a Fisher channel and real interest rate shocks to an interest rate exposure channel; both channels are likely to contribute to the expansionary effects of accommodative monetary policy. Indeed, using a sufficient statistic approach, I find that redistribution could be the dominant reason why aggregate consumer spending reacts to transitory changes in the real interest rate, provided households’ elasticities of intertemporal substitution are reasonably small (0.3 or less in the United States). I then build and calibrate a general equilibrium model with heterogeneity in MPCs, and I evaluate how the redistribution channel alters the economy’s response to shocks. When household assets and liabilities have short effective maturities, the interest rate exposure channel raises the elasticity of aggregate demand to real interest rates, which dampens fluctuations in the natural rate of interest in response to exogenous shocks and amplifies the real effects of monetary policy shocks. The model predicts that if U.S. mortgages all had adjustable rates—as they do in the U.K.—the effect of interest-rate changes on consumer spending would more than double. In addition, this effect would be asymmetric, with rate increases reducing spending by more than cuts would increase it.","2019","2023-11-28 15:51:48","2023-11-28 15:51:48","","2333-2367","","6","109","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It is therefore surprising that researchers and practitioners do not have available to them a long history of high-frequency yield curve estimates. This paper fills that void by making public the Treasury yield curve estimates of the Federal Reserve Board at a daily frequency from 1961 to the present. We use a well-known and simple smoothing method that is shown to fit the data very well. The resulting estimates can be used to compute yields or forward rates for any horizon.

Researchers frequently find evidence of a 'price puzzle': increases in the policy rate are followed by higher rather than lower inflation. This can be explained by the forward-looking behaviour of the central bank. Inflation does not rise in response to an increase in the policy rate but, instead, the central bank raises its policy rate when it expects inflation to increase in the future. To identify the true causal effects of monetary policy on inflation, it is hence necessary to control for this systematic policy response to expected inflation. For Australia, however, the price puzzle has been found even when controlling for the cash rate's systematic response to the Reserve Bank's own inflation forecasts. I argue that this is due to an additional but omitted systematic response of the cash rate to credit market shocks. Easier credit market conditions lead to an economic expansion and higher inflation. Therefore, the Bank raises the cash rate – its policy rate – when credit spreads decline. However, the Bank's inflation forecasts do not fully capture the inflationary effect of easier credit conditions. As a result, cash rate changes are positively correlated with future inflation even when purging them of the cash rate's response to the Bank's inflation forecasts. Accordingly, I show that accounting for the cash rate's additional response to credit market conditions resolves the price puzzle. As expected, a higher cash rate reduces inflation and output growth, and raises the unemployment rate.</jats:p>","2020","2023-11-28 15:51:51","2023-11-28 15:51:51","","NA-NA","","NA","NA","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This paper charts the way the ECB has defined, interpreted and applied its monetary policy framework – its strategy – over the years from its inception, in search of evidence and lessons that can inform those reflections. Our “Tale of Two Decades” is largely a tale of “two regimes”: one – stretching slightly beyond the ECB’s mid-point – marked by decent growth in real incomes and a distribution of shocks to inflation almost universally to the upside; and the second – starting well into the post-Lehman period – characterised by endemic instability and crisis, with the distribution of shocks eventually switching from inflationary to continuously disinflationary. We show how the most defining element of the ECB’s monetary policy framework, its characteristic definition of price stability with a hard 2% ceiling, functioned as a key shock-absorber in the relatively high-inflation years prior to the crisis, but offered a softer defence in the face of the disinflationary forces that hit the euro area in its aftermath. The imperative to halt persistent disinflation in the post-crisis era therefore called for a radical, unprecedented policy response, comprising negative policy rates, enhanced forms of forward guidance, a large asset purchase programme and targeted long-term loans to banks. We study the multidimensional interactions among these four instruments and quantify their impact on inflation and economic activity.","2019","2023-11-28 15:51:51","2023-11-28 15:51:51","","NA-NA","","NA","NA","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This paper develops a new estimator that is based on the heteroskedasticity that exists in high-frequency data. We show that the response of asset prices to changes in monetary policy can be identified based on the increase in the variance of policy shocks that occurs on days of FOMC meetings and of the Chairman's semi-annual monetary policy testimony to Congress. The identification approach employed requires a much weaker set of assumptions than needed under the “event-study” approach that is typically used in this context. The results indicate that an increase in short-term interest rates results in a decline in stock prices and in an upward shift in the yield curve that becomes smaller at longer maturities.

The following year, threat-of-audit letters were randomly assigned and sent to tax filers in both groups. We present three main empirical findings. First, using baseline audit data, we find that the tax evasion rate is close to zero for income subject to third-party reporting, but substantial for self-reported income. Since most income is subject to third-party reporting, the overall evasion rate is modest. Second, using quasi-experimental variation created by large kinks in the income tax schedule, we find that marginal tax rates have a positive impact on tax evasion for self-reported income, but that this effect is small in comparison to legal avoidance and behavioral responses. Third, using the randomization of enforcement, we find that prior audits and threat-of-audit letters have significant effects on self-reported income, but no effect on third-party reported income.

"KSISI7N2","journalArticle","2002","Sims, Christopher A.","The Role of Models and Probabilities in the Monetary Policy Process","Brookings Papers on Economic Activity","","","10.1353/eca.2003.0009","","THis IS A PAPER ON THE way data relate to decisionmaking in central banks. One component of the paper is based on a series of interviews with staff members and a few policy committee members of four central banks: the Swedish Riksbank, the European Central Bank (ECB), the Bank of England, and the U.S. Federal Reserve. These interviews focused on the policy process and sought to determine how forecasts were made, how uncertainty was characterized and handled, and what role formal economic models played in the process at each central bank. In each of the four central banks, ""subjective"" forecasting, based on data analysis by sectoral ""experts,"" plays an important role. At the Federal Reserve, a seventeen-year record of model-based forecasts can be compared with a longer record of subjective forecasts, and a second component of this paper is an analysis of these records. Two of the central banks--the Riksbank and the Bank of England-have explicit inflation-targeting policies that require them to set quantitative targets for inflation and to publish, several times a year, their forecasts of inflation. A third component of the paper discusses the effects of such a policy regime on the policy process and on the role of models within it. The large models in use in central banks today grew out of a first generation of large models that were thought to be founded on the statistical theory of simultaneous-equations models. Today's large models have completely lost their connection to this theory, or indeed to any other probability-based theory of inference. The models are now fit to data by ad hoc procedures that have no grounding in statistical theory. A fourth component of the paper discusses how inference using these models reached this state and why academic econometrics has had so little impact in correcting it. Despite their failure to provide better forecasts, their lack of a firm statistical foundation, and the weaknesses in their underlying economic theory, the large models play an important role in the policy process. A final component of the paper discusses what this role is and how the model's performance in it might be improved. The Policy Process At all four central banks the policy process runs in a regular cycle; that cycle is quarterly in frequency at all except the Federal Reserve, where it is keyed to the meetings of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), which take place roughly every six weeks. Each central bank has a primary macroeconomic model but uses other models as well. The primary models are the ones used to construct projections of alternative scenarios, conditional on various assumptions about future disturbances or policies or on various assumptions about the current state of the economy. Where there is feedback between models and subjective forecasts, it is generally through the primary model. The primary models have some strong similarities. The ECB's model contains about fifteen behavioral equations, the Bank of England's twenty-one, the Riksbank's twenty-seven, and the Federal Reserve's about forty. (1) Each has at least some expectational components, with the Federal Reserve and Riksbank models the most complete in this respect. Those central banks whose models are less forward-looking describe them somewhat apologetically, suggesting that they are working on including more forward-looking behavior. The Riksbank and the Bank of England have publicly described ""suites"" of models of various types, including vector autoregressive (VAR) models, smaller macroeconomic models, and optimizing models. Some of these models produce regular forecasts that are seen by those involved in the policy process, but at both central banks none except the primary model has a regular, well-defined role. The other central banks also have secondary models with some informal impact on the policy process. …","2002","2023-11-28 15:51:52","2023-11-28 15:51:52","","1-62","","2","2002","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

"CG9NAZV6","journalArticle","1971","Rothenberg, Thomas J.","IDENTIFICATION IN PARAMETRIC MODELS","Econometrica","","","10.2307/1913267","","A theory of identification is developed for a general stochastic model whose probability law is determined by a finite number of parameters. It is shown under weak regularity conditions that local identifiability of the unknown parameter vector is equivalent to nonsingularity of the information matrix. The use of ""reduced-form"" parameters to establish identifiability is also analyzed. The general results are applied to the familiar problem of determining whether the coefficients of a system of linear simultaneous equations are identifiable. THE IDENTIFICATION PROBLEM concerns the possibility of drawing inferences from observed samples to an underlying theoretical structure. An important part of econometric theory involves the derivation of conditions under which a given structure will be identifiable. The basic results for linear simultaneous equation systems under linear parameter constraints were given by Koopmans and Rubin [10] in 1950. Extensions to nonlinear systems and nonlinear constraints were made by Wald [15], Fisher [4, 5, 6], and others. A summary of these results can be found in Fisher's comprehensive study [7]. The identification problem has also been thoroughly analyzed in the context of the classical single-equation errors-in-variables model. The basic papers here are by Neyman [12] and Reiers0l [13]. Most of this previous work on the identification problem has emphasized the special features of the particular model being examined. This has tended to obscure the fact that the problem of structural identification is a very general one. It is not restricted to simultaneous-equation or errors-in-variables models. As Koopmans and Reiers0l [9] emphasize, the identification problem is ""a general and fundamental problem arising, in many fields of inquiry, as a concomitant of the scientific procedure that postulates the existence of a structure."" In their important paper Koopmans and Reiers0l define the basic characteristics of the general identification problem. In the present paper we shall, in the case of a general parametric model, derive some identifiability criteria. These criteria include the standard rank conditions for linear models as special cases. Our approach is based in part on the information matrix of classical mathematical statistics. Since this matrix is a measure of the amount of information about the unknown parameters available in the sample, it is not surprising that it should be related to identification. For lack of identification is simply the lack of sufficient information to distinguish between alternative structures. The following results make this relationship more precise.2","1971","2023-11-28 15:51:53","2023-11-28 15:51:53","","577-591","","3","39","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The response of house prices is sizable, driving a signicant adjustment in loanto-income ratios but little change in loan-to-value ratios.

We use dynamic term structure models to uncover to what extent signaling and portfolio balance channels caused these declines. For the U.S. and Canada, the evidence supports the view that LSAPs had substantial signaling effects. For Australian and German yields, signaling effects were present but likely more moderate, and portfolio balance effects appear to have played a relatively larger role than in the U.S. and Canada. Portfolio balance effects were small for Japanese yields and signaling effects basically nonexistent. These findings about LSAP channels are consistent with predictions based on interest rate dynamics during normal times: Signaling effects tend to be large for countries with strong yield responses to conventional U.S. monetary policy surprises, and portfolio balance effects are consistent with the degree of substitutability across international bonds, as measured by the covariance between foreign and U.S. bond returns.","2014","2023-11-28 15:51:56","2023-11-28 15:51:56","","24-46","","NA","44","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, some recent studies have questioned both the exogeneity and the relevance of these monetary policy surprises as instruments, especially for estimating the macroeconomic effects of monetary policy shocks. For example, monetary policy surprises are correlated with macroeconomic and financial data that is publicly available prior to the FOMC announcement. We address these concerns in two ways: First, we expand the set of monetary policy announcements to include speeches by the Fed Chair, which essentially doubles the number and importance of announcements in our dataset. Second, we explain the predictability of the monetary policy surprises in terms of the ""Fed response to news"" channel of Bauer and Swanson (2021) and account for it by orthogonalizing the surprises with respect to macroeconomic and financial data. Our subsequent reassessment of the effects of monetary policy yields two key results: First, estimates of the high-frequency effects on financial markets are largely unchanged.

At high leverage ratios, this positive relation weakens until it reaches a point where additional leverage is associated with a decrease in sensitivity to monetary policy.

The difference in the nature of debt contracts leads to different risk taking behavior in the two debt markets.

In addition, we exploit variation in industry characteristics to obtain an alternative set of difference-in-differences estimates. Financial liberalization is found to have a positive effect on both growth and volatility of production across industries. The positive growth effect comes from increased entry of firms, higher capital accumulation, and an expansion in total employment. By contrast, we do not detect any effect of financial liberalization on measured productivity.

In this work, we propose an IR estimation methodology based on B-spline smoothing called smooth local projections (SLP). The SLP approach preserves the flexibility of standard LP, can substantially increase precision, and is straightforward to implement. A simulation study shows that SLP can deliver substantial gains in IR estimation over LP.

Is this because crises tend to take place during economic downturns, or do banking sector problems have independent negative effects on the economy? To answer this question we examine industrial sectors with differing needs for financing. If banking crises have an exogenous detrimental effect on real activity, then sectors more dependent on external finance should perform relatively worse during banking crises. The evidence in this paper supports this view. Additional support comes from the fact that sectors that predominantly have small firms, and thus are typically bank dependent, also perform relatively worse during banking crises. The differential effects across sectors are stronger in developing countries, in countries with less access to foreign finance, and where banking crises were more severe.(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)","2008","2023-11-28 15:54:19","2023-11-28 15:54:19","","89-112","","1","17","","Journal of Financial Intermediation","","Journal of Financial Intermediation","","","","","","","","","","","","","Publisher: Elsevier","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We find that the often cited post–Bretton Woods transition from fixed to flexible arrangements is overstated; regimes with limited flexibility remain in the majority. Even if central bankers’ communications jargon has evolved considerably in recent decades, it is apparent that many still place a large implicit weight on the exchange rate. The U.S. dollar scores as the world's dominant anchor currency by a very large margin. By some metrics, its use is far wider today than 70 years ago. In contrast, the global role of the euro appears to have stalled. We argue that in addition to the usual safe assets story, the record accumulation of reserves since 2002 may also have to do with many countries’ desire to stabilize exchange rates in an environment of markedly reduced exchange rate restrictions or, more broadly, capital controls: an important amendment to the conventional portrayal of the macroeconomic trilemma.","2019","2023-11-28 15:54:19","2023-11-28 15:54:19","","599-646","","2","134","","The Quarterly Journal of Economics","","The Quarterly Journal of Economics","","","","","","","","","","","","","Publisher: Oxford University Press","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In contrast to the existing literature, the identification strategy is based on the differences in sensitivities to financial conditions across industries. The results show that sectors with larger liquidity needs are more volatile and experience deeper crises in financially underdeveloped countries. At the macroeconomic level, the results suggest that changes in financial development can generate important differences in aggregate volatility. The author also finds that financially underdeveloped countries partially protect themselves from volatility by concentrating less output in sectors with large liquidity needs. Nevertheless, this insulation mechanism seems to be insufficient to reverse the effects of financial underdevelopment on within-sector volatility. Finally, the author provides new evidence that: 1) Financial development affects volatility mainly through the intensive margin (output per firm). 2) Both the quality of information generated by firms, and the development of financial intermediaries have independent effects on sectoral volatility. 3) The development of financial intermediaries is more important than the development of equity markets for the reduction of volatility.(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)","2006","2023-11-28 15:54:20","2023-11-28 15:54:20","","677-722","","3","80","","Journal of Financial Economics","","Journal of Financial Economics","","","","","","","","","","","","","Publisher: Elsevier","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

If the banking system is the key element allowing credit constraints to be relaxed, then a sudden loss of these intermediaries in a system where such intermediaries are important should have a disproportionately contractionary impact on the sectors that flourished due to their reliance on banks. Using data from 38 developed and developing countries that experienced financial crises during the last quarter century, we find that sectors highly dependent on external finance tend to experience a substantially greater contraction of value added during a banking crisis in deeper financial systems than in countries with shallower financial systems. On average, in a country experiencing a banking crisis, a sector at the 75th percentile of external dependence and located in a country at the 75th percentile of private credit to GDP would experience a 1.6 percent greater contraction in growth in value added between the crisis and pre-crisis period than a sector at the 25th percentile of external dependence and private credit to GDP. This effect is sizeable compared with an overall mean decline in growth of 3.5 percent between these two periods.

There is, however, considerable cross-industry heterogeneity in both the overall policy effects and the degree of asymmetry across the two business cycle phases. We then explore which industry characteristics can account for this cross-industry heterogeneity. Differences in the overall policy effects can mainly be explained by the durability of the goods produced in the sector. This can be regarded as evidence for the conventional interest rate/cost-of-capital channel. In contrast, differences in the degree of asymmetry of policy effects are related to differences in financial structure, in particular the maturity structure of debt, the coverage ratio, financial leverage and firm size.

The aggregate effect of monetary policy may therefore depend on the distribution of default risk, which varies over time.","2020","2023-11-28 15:54:26","2023-11-28 15:54:26","","2473-2502","","6","88","","Econometrica","","Econometrica","","","","","","","","","","","","","Publisher: Econometric Society","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The crisis represents an unexplored negative shock to the supply of external finance for non-financial firms. Corporate investment declines significantly following the onset of the crisis, controlling for firm fixed effects and time-varying measures of investment opportunities. Consistent with a causal effect of a supply shock, the decline is greatest for firms that have low cash reserves or high net short-term debt, are financially constrained, or operate in industries dependent on external finance. To address endogeneity concerns, we measure firms' financial positions as much as four years prior to the crisis, and confirm that similar results do not follow placebo crises in the summers of 2003-2006. Nor do similar results follow the negative demand shock caused by September 11, 2001. The effects weaken considerably beginning in the third quarter of 2008, when the demand-side effects of the crisis became apparent. Additional analysis suggests an important precautionary savings motive for seemingly excess cash that is generally overlooked in the literature.","2010","2023-11-28 15:54:27","2023-11-28 15:54:27","","418-435","","3","97","","Journal of Financial Economics","","Journal of Financial Economics","","","","","","","","","","","","","Publisher: Elsevier","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The model is a synthesis of the leading approaches in the literature. In particular, the framework exhibits a ""financial accelerator"", in that endogenous developments in credit markets work to amplify and propagate shocks to the macroeconomy. In addition, we add several features to the model that are designed to enhance the empirical relevance. First, we incorporate money and price stickiness, which allows us to study how credit market frictions may influence the transmission of monetary policy. In addition, we allow for lags in investment which enables the model to generate both hump-shaped output dynamics and a lead-lag relation between asset prices and investment, as is consistent with the data. Finally, we allow for heterogeneity among firms to capture the fact that borrowers have differential access to capital markets. Under reasonable parametrizations of the model, the financial accelerator has a significant influence on business cycle dynamics.","1999","2023-11-28 15:54:27","2023-11-28 15:54:27","","1341-1393","","","1","","","","Handbook of Macroeconomics","","","","Elsevier","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Capital controls, institutions, and interactions","Journal of Development Economics","","","","https://ideas.repec.org/a/eee/deveco/v81y2006i1p163-192.html","We extend our earlier work, focusing on the links between capital account liberalization, legal and institutional development, and financial development, especially that in equity markets. In a panel data analysis encompassing 108 countries and twenty years ranging from 1980 to 2000, we explore several dimensions of the financial sector. First, we test whether financial openness can lead to equity market development when we control for the level of legal and institutional development. Then, we examine whether the opening of the goods sector is a precondition for financial opening. Finally, we investigate whether a well-developed banking sector is a precondition for financial liberalization to lead to equity market development and also whether bank and equity market development complements or substitutes. Our empirical results suggest that a higher level of financial openness contributes to the development of equity markets only if a threshold level of general legal systems and institutions is attained, which is more prevalent among emerging market countries. Among emerging market countries, a higher level of bureaucratic quality and law and order, as well as the lower levels of corruption, increases the effect of financial opening in fostering the development of equity markets. We also find that the finance-related legal/institutional variables do not enhance the effect of capital account opening as strongly as the general legal/institutional variables. In examining the issue of the sequencing, we find that the liberalization in cross-border goods transactions is found to be a precondition for capital account liberalization. Our findings also indicate that the development in the banking sector is a precondition for equity market development, and that the developments in these two types of financial markets have synergistic effects.(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)","2006","2023-11-28 15:54:28","2023-11-28 15:54:28","","163-192","","1","81","","Journal of Development Economics","","Journal of Development Economics","","","","","","","","","","","","","Publisher: Elsevier","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this article, we develop a tractable dynamic general equilibrium model in which unsecured firm credit arises from self-enforcing borrowing constraints, preventing an efficient capital allocation among heterogeneous firms. Unsecured credit rests on the value that borrowers attach to a good credit reputation which is a forward-looking variable. We argue that self-fulfilling beliefs over future credit conditions naturally generate endogenously persistent business-cycle dynamics. A dynamic complementarity between current and future borrowing limits permits uncorrelated sunspot shocks to unsecured debt to trigger persistent aggregate fluctuations in both secured and unsecured debt, factor productivity, and output. We show that these sunspot shocks are quantitatively important, accounting for around half of output volatility.","2016","2023-11-28 15:54:29","2023-11-28 15:54:29","","1364-1405","","4","83","","Review of Economic Studies","","Review of Economic Studies","","","","","","","","","","","","","Publisher: Oxford University Press","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Data from the 1953-90 period are used to identify money-supply shocks and their effects on output for a panel of 18 European countries. Many different specifications and estimation methods strongly support asymmetry: negative money-supply shocks are shown to have a statistically significant effect on output, whereas the effect of positive shocks is statistically insignificant. A similar asymmetry governs the output effects of interest rate changes. The sources of these asymmetries are traced to similar behavior for consumption and investment. These findings imply that positive money-supply shocks may be an ineffective anti-recession policy, and more generally, that the monetary component of the optimal stabilization policy should be less activist than generally thought.

Using a common dataset and a flexible empirical approach, we find that researchers are faced with substantial specification uncertainty, as different combinations of various a priori reasonable specification choices give rise to a vast set of point estimates. Moreover, given a specification, estimation is subject to considerable sampling uncertainty due to weak identification. We highlight the assumptions that seem to matter most for identification and the configuration of point estimates.

Then, we present a methodology that combines such regional and aggregate data in order to estimate a medium‐scale New Keynesian DSGE model. We find that aggregate demand shocks were important drivers of aggregate employment during the Great Recession, but the wage stickiness necessary for them to account for the slow employment recovery and the modest fall in aggregate wages is inconsistent with the flexibility of wages we observe across U.S. states.

Some researchers argue that the slope of the curve in the United States fell substantially around 20 years ago so that unemployment now has little or no effect on inflation. This paper shows that another hypothesis is equally consistent with the data: The Phillips curve may be nonlinear when inflation is low, with the economy having operated in the flat region of the curve for most of the past 20 years. The next few years may be decisive in the debate between these hypotheses, as unemployment has returned to a range in which a nonlinear curve ought to display significant steepness. A flat Phillips curve implies little change in inflation going forward, but a nonlinear curve implies moderate increases in inflation over the next few years.","2019","2023-11-28 16:20:03","2023-11-28 16:20:03","","","","","","","","","","","","","Peterson Institute for International Economics","","","","","","","","","Issue: WP19-6","","","","unemployment rate; Non-accelerating inflation rate of unemployment (NAIRU)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We show why this result need not imply that the Phillips curve does not hold—on the contrary, our conceptual framework is built under the assumption that the Phillips curve always holds. The reason is simple: if monetary policy is set with the goal of minimizing welfare losses (measured as the sum of deviations of inflation from its target and output from its potential), subject to a Phillips curve, a central bank will seek to increase inflation when output is below potential. This targeting rule will impart a negative correlation between inflation and the output gap, blurring the identification of the (positively sloped) Phillips curve.

However, empirical studies of this question and other questions concerning the role of transparency have lacked access to a time-varying highfrequency measure of transparency. This paper presents a new measure of the transparency of Federal Reserve deliberations, derived from the documents that the Fed uses to record and summarize each of its meetings. The measure—the similarity of the minutes and transcripts of each Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting—is largely, though not entirely, shaped by FOMC leadership. Monetary policy shocks have about a 40 percent larger effect on nominal and real interest rates when the prevailing level of transparency is high, suggesting an important role for transparency in determining the efficacy of monetary policy. These effects are primarily driven by transparency about monetary policy strategies conditional on the state of the economy.","2023","2023-11-28 17:10:05","2023-11-28 17:10:05","2023-11-28 17:10:05","49-97","","3","19","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","ideas.repec.org","","Publisher: International Journal of Central Banking","","C:\Users\Enzinger\Zotero\storage\2XSDJR65\Acosta - 2023 - A New Measure of Central Bank Transparency and Imp.pdf; C:\Users\Enzinger\Zotero\storage\C8AXAVG3\y2023q3a2.html","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, the sparse information sets typically used in these empirical models lead to at least three potential problems with the results. First, to the extent that central banks and the private sector have information not reflected in the VAR, the measurement of policy innovations is likely to be contaminated. Second, the choice of a specific data series to represent a general economic concept such as “real activity” is often arbitrary to some degree. Third, impulse responses can be observed only for the included variables, which generally constitute only a small subset of the variables that the researcher and policy-maker care about. In this paper we investigate one potential solution to this limited information problem, which combines the standard structural VAR analysis with recent developments in factor analysis for large data sets. We find that the information that our factor-augmented VAR (FAVAR) methodology exploits is indeed important to properly identify the monetary transmission mechanism.

A simple theoretical framework illustrates how Fed-managed uncertainty introduces a wedge between the standard Taylor-type policy rule and the optimal decision. Using private Fed deliberations, we quantify the types of uncertainty the FOMC perceives and their effects on its policy stance. The FOMC's expressed inflation uncertainty strongly predicts a more hawkish policy stance that is not explained either by the Fed's macroeconomic forecasts or by public uncertainty proxies.

Adapting neural network methods for text analysis from the computer science literature, I analyze how the wording in statements of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) impacts fed funds futures (FFF) prices when these statements are announced. Using text analysis on FOMC statements and internal meeting materials, I create a new monetary policy “text shock” series for 2005-2014 that isolates the variation of FFF prices induced by the FOMC’s forward guidance, not their current assessment of the economy. I find that the wording of FOMC statements accounts for four times more variation in FFF prices than direct announcements of changes in the target federal funds rate. I also find that the impact of forward guidance on real interest rates is twice as large when using text shocks over other measures, like changes in FFF prices. Furthermore, the text shock produces responses in output and inflation qualitatively consistent with workhorse macroeconomic models, whereas changes in FFF prices do not.","2020","2023-11-28 17:36:53","2023-11-28 17:36:53","2023-11-28 17:36:53","","","","","","","Text Shocks and Monetary Surprises","","","","","","","","","","","","Semantic Scholar","","","","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Text-Shocks-and-Monetary-Surprises%3A-Text-Analysis-Handlan/150f4edd79ce5e7d9e41f34cfd8eb8027410176c","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We apply the methodology to statements released by the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) after its policy meetings starting in 1999. Using intra-day financial quotes, we find that short-term nominal Treasury yields respond to changes in policy rates around policy announcements, whereas longer-dated Treasuries mainly react to changes in policy communication. Using lower frequency data, we find that changes in the content of the statements lead policy rate decisions by more than a year in univariate interest rate forecasting and vector autoregression (VAR) models. When we estimate Treasury yield responses to the shocks identified in the VAR, we find communication to be a more important determinant of Treasury rates than contemporaneous policy rate decisions. These results are consistent with the view that the FOMC releases information about future policy rate actions in its statements and that market participants incorporate this information when pricing longer-dated Treasuries. Finally, we decompose realized policy rate decisions using a forward-looking Taylor rule model. Based on this decomposition, we find that FOMC statements contain significant information regarding both the predicted rule-based interest rate and the Taylor-rule residual component, and that content of the statements leads the residual by a few quarters.","2009-09","2023-11-28 17:50:50","2023-11-28 17:50:50","2023-11-28 17:50:50","","","","","","","Measuring Central Bank Communication","Working Paper Series","","","","National Bureau of Economic Research","","","","Working Paper","","","National Bureau of Economic Research","","DOI: 10.3386/w15367","","C:\Users\Enzinger\Zotero\storage\2DCSIS3K\Lucca und Trebbi - 2009 - Measuring Central Bank Communication An Automated.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","15367","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This similarity to econometrics raises questions: How do these new empirical tools fit with what we know? As empirical economists, how can we use them? We present a way of thinking about machine learning that gives it its own place in the econometric toolbox. Machine learning not only provides new tools, it solves a different problem. Specifically, machine learning revolves around the problem of prediction, while many economic applications revolve around parameter estimation. So applying machine learning to economics requires finding relevant tasks. Machine learning algorithms are now technically easy to use: you can download convenient packages in R or Python. This also raises the risk that the algorithms are applied naively or their output is misinterpreted. We hope to make them conceptually easier to use by providing a crisper understanding of how these algorithms work, where they excel, and where they can stumble—and thus where they can be most usefully applied.","2017-05","2023-11-28 17:52:01","2023-11-28 17:52:01","2023-11-28 17:52:01","87-106","","2","31","","","Machine Learning","","","","","","","en","","","","","www.aeaweb.org","","","","C:\Users\Enzinger\Zotero\storage\E677RICV\Mullainathan und Spiess - 2017 - Machine Learning An Applied Econometric Approach.pdf","","","Econometric Modeling: General; Econometric Software","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

R.","A New Monetary Policy Shock with Text Analysis","Cambridge Working Papers in Economics","","","","https://ideas.repec.org//p/cam/camdae/2148.html","Measures of monetary shocks commonly give rise to the puzzling result where a monetary tightening has an expansionary effect. A possible reason is that agents may believe that monetary shocks contain information regarding the central bankâ€™s assessment of the economic environment (Nakamura and Steinsson, 2018). Under this hypothesis, the estimated response to monetary policy shocks would contain two conflating effects: the actual effect of monetary policy and the reaction of private agents to the newly acquired information. This paper overcomes this problem by extracting a novel series of monetary shocks using text analysis methods on central bank documents. The resulting text-based variables contain the informational content from changes in the policy rate. Thus, they can be used to extract exogenous changes in monetary policy that are orthogonal to any central bank information. Using this information-free measure of monetary policy shocks reveals that a monetary tightening is not expansionary, even when estimated on more recent periods.","2021-06-09","2023-11-28 17:53:10","2023-11-28 17:53:10","2023-11-28 17:53:10","","","","","","","","","","","Cambridge Working Papers in Economics","","","en","","","","","ideas.repec.org","","Number: 2148 Publisher: Faculty of Economics, University of Cambridge","","C:\Users\Enzinger\Zotero\storage\3PIBYPNS\Ochs - 2021 - A New Monetary Policy Shock with Text Analysis.pdf; C:\Users\Enzinger\Zotero\storage\NC2PT429\2148.html","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The benchmarks used for these historical comparisons are the average root mean squared forecast errors (RMSEs) made by various private and government forecasters over the past twenty years. This paper documents how these benchmarks are constructed and discusses some of their properties. We draw several conclusions. First, if past performance is a reasonable guide to future accuracy, considerable uncertainty surrounds macroeconomic projections. Second, different forecasters have similar accuracy. Third, estimates of uncertainty about future real activity and interest rates are now considerably greater than prior to the financial crisis; in contrast, estimates of inflation accuracy have changed little. Finally, fan charts, constructed under certain assumptions and viewed in conjunction with the FOMC’s qualitative assessments, provide a reasonable approximation to future uncertainty.","2019-10-01","2023-11-28 17:55:21","2023-11-28 17:55:21","2023-11-28 17:55:21","1564-1582","","4","35","","International Journal of Forecasting","Gauging the uncertainty of the economic outlook using historical forecasting errors","","","","","","","","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","C:\Users\Enzinger\Zotero\storage\RK4U6KEW\Reifschneider und Tulip - 2019 - Gauging the uncertainty of the economic outlook us.pdf; C:\Users\Enzinger\Zotero\storage\SHICGQXQ\S0169207018301432.html","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Our approach entails directly estimating the central bank’s objective function from the sentiment expressed by policymakers in their internal meetings. We apply the approach to the objective function of the U.S. Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC). The results challenge two key aspects of conventional wisdom regarding FOMC preferences. First, the FOMC had an implicit inflation target of approximately $1\frac{1}{2}$$\%$ on average over our baseline 2000–11 sample period, significantly below the commonly assumed value of 2. Second, the FOMC’s loss depends strongly on output growth and stock market performance and less so on their perception of current economic slack.","2022-10-01","2023-11-28 17:56:43","2023-11-28 17:56:43","2023-11-28 17:56:43","2768-2805","","5","89","","The Review of Economic Studies","Taking the Fed at its Word","","","","","","","","","","","","Silverchair","","","","C:\Users\Enzinger\Zotero\storage\KW83GMX2\Shapiro und Wilson - 2022 - Taking the Fed at its Word A New Approach to Esti.pdf; C:\Users\Enzinger\Zotero\storage\YB6W3EDE\6484651.html","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The creation of this series was motivated by Thornton (2005). Analyzing the verbatim transcripts of the FOMC, Thornton finds that most of the FOMC believed they began targeting the funds rate even before it deemphasized M1's role in the Fed's daily operating procedure. The new series was constructed using the verbatim transcripts of FOMC meetings, the FOMC Blue Book, the Report of Open Market Operations and Money Market Conditions, and data that the author obtained from the Desk for the Federal Reserve Bank of New York dealing with open market operations over the period March 1984 through December 1996. The new series compared with another widely used series presented in Thornton and Wheelock (2000).

Sometime thereafter the FOMC switched to a funds rate targeting procedure but never formally announced the change. Given the close correspondence between a borrowed reserves operating procedure and a funds rate targeting procedure, Thornton (1988) suggested that the FOMC went immediately to a funds rate targeting procedure. Others date the switch to the funds rate procedure later. Meulendyke (1998) suggests the switch came in late 1987, while others suggest the change occurred later. This paper reviews the verbatim transcripts of the FOMC meetings to establish the timing of the switch. The verbatim transcripts suggest that the FOMC effectively switched to a funds rate targeting procedure in 1982. The documentary evidence is supported by an analysis of the spread between the funds rate and the funds rate target, which suggests that the differences in the behavior of the spread before October 1979 and after October 1982 are relatively small and economically unimportant.","2006","2023-11-28 18:01:39","2023-11-28 18:01:39","2023-11-28 18:01:39","2039-2071","","8","38","","","When Did the FOMC Begin Targeting the Federal Funds Rate?","","","","","","","","","","","","JSTOR","","Publisher: [Wiley, Ohio State University Press]","","C:\Users\Enzinger\Zotero\storage\R8FKH58P\Thornton - 2006 - When Did the FOMC Begin Targeting the Federal Fund.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We derive an instrumental variable (IV) strategy that separates supply-driven loan retrenchment from local loan demand by exploiting linkages through BHC internal capital markets across spatially separate BHC member banks.

The simplest form of the necessary and sufficient condition shown in Theorem 7 of Rubio-Ramirez et al (2010) checks the number of zero restrictions and the ranks of particular matrices without requiring knowledge of the true value of the structural or reduced-form parameters. However, this note shows by counterexample that this condition is not sufficient for global identification. Analytical investigation of the counterexample clarifies why their sufficiency claim breaks down. The problem with the rank condition is that it allows for the possibility that restrictions are redundant, in the sense that one or more restrictions may be implied by other restrictions, in which case the implied restriction contains no identifying information. We derive a modified necessary and sufficient condition for SVAR global identification and clarify how it can be assessed in practice.","2021-02","2023-11-28 18:06:12","2023-11-28 18:06:12","2023-11-28 18:06:12","","","","","","","","","","","Papers","","","en","","","","","ideas.repec.org","","Number: 2102.04048 Publisher: arXiv.org","","C:\Users\Enzinger\Zotero\storage\XN3G8HNE\2102.04048.html","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In particular, we begin by using sign-restriction based identification schemes to isolate innovations in optimism or pessimism and we document the extent to which such episodes explain macroeconomic fluctuations. We then examine the link between these identified mood shocks and subsequent developments in fundamentals using alternative identification schemes (i.e., variants of the maximum forecast error variance approach). We find that there is a very close link between the two, suggesting that agents' feelings of optimism and pessimism are at least partially rational as total factor productivity (TFP) is observed to rise 8-10 quarters after an initial bout of optimism. While this later finding is consistent with some previous findings in the news shock literature, we cannot rule out that such episodes reflect self-fulfilling beliefs. Overall, we argue that mood swings account for over 50% of business cycle fluctuations in hours and output.","2011-12","2023-11-28 18:10:05","2023-11-28 18:10:05","2023-11-28 18:10:05","","","","","","","","Working Paper Series","","","","National Bureau of Economic Research","","","","Working Paper","","","National Bureau of Economic Research","","DOI: 10.3386/w17651","","C:\Users\Enzinger\Zotero\storage\SXP4QDBV\Beaudry et al. - 2011 - Do Mood Swings Drive Business Cycles and is it Rat.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","17651","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We show that projection inference can be applied to a general class of stationary models, is computationally feasible, and—as the sample size grows large—it produces regions that have both frequentist coverage and robust Bayesian credibility of at least 1 − α.

These findings are consistent with a heterogeneous-beliefs model in which one of the agents is wrong about consumption growth.","","2023-11-28 19:35:09","2023-11-28 19:35:09","2023-11-28 19:35:09","","","n/a","n/a","","","","","","","","","","en","© 2023 the American Finance Association.","","","","Wiley Online Library","","_eprint: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/jofi.13276","","C:\Users\Enzinger\Zotero\storage\WI35ZLTF\jofi.html; C:\Users\Enzinger\Zotero\storage\P86SFCDJ\Bauer und Chernov - Interest Rate Skewness and Biased Beliefs.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We show that Bayesian agents learning about hard-to-learn features of the data generating process (low frequency behavior) can generate all the prominent aggregate anomalies emphasized in the literature. We show this for two applications: professional forecasts of nominal interest rates for the sample period 1980-2019 and CBO forecasts of GDP growth for the sample period 1976-2019.

Because private sector forecasts are not bound to be equal to central banks’ forecasts, what markets label as unexpected may or may not be unanticipated by the central bank. Monetary surprises can thus incorporate anticipatory effects if market participants fail to correctly account for the systematic component of policy when they are surprised by an interest rate decision. Depending on how market participants perceive the policy decision, their economic projections and the associated risk compensations move in opposite directions, and do so at the time of the announcement. Hence, and regardless of the width of the measurement window, monetary surprises capture more than just the monetary policy shock, and their use as external instruments for identification is potentially compromised. Monetary ‘surprises’ are dependent on, and shown to be predictable by both central banks’ forecasts and past information available to market participants prior to the announcement. A New-Keynesian framework sketches the intuition. The resulting distortions in the estimated impulse response functions can be dramatic, both qualitatively and quantitatively. A new set of monetary surprises, free of anticipatory effects and unpredictable by past information, are shown to retrieve transmission coefficients to a monetary policy shock consistent with macroeconomic theory even in informationally deficient VARs.","2016-11-04","2023-11-29 09:07:41","2023-11-29 09:07:41","2023-11-29 09:07:41","","","","","","","Unsurprising Shocks","","","","","","Rochester, NY","en","","SSRN Scholarly Paper","","","Social Science Research Network","","","","C:\Users\Enzinger\Zotero\storage\SJPAIWZI\Miranda-Agrippino - 2016 - Unsurprising Shocks Information, Premia, and the .pdf","","","monetary policy; event study; expectations; identification with external instruments; information asymmetries; monetary surprises; proxy SVAR","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2865585","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A contractionary monetary (expansionary fiscal) shock can lead to a depreciation, rather than an appreciation, of the domestic currency if debt is not backed by future fiscal surpluses. We look at daily movements of the Brazilian real around policy announcements and find strong support for the existence of two regimes with opposite signs. The unconventional response of the exchange rate occurs when fiscal fundamentals are deteriorating and markets’ concern about debt sustainability is rising. To rationalize these findings, we propose a model of sovereign default in which foreign investors are subject to higher haircuts and fiscal policy shifts between Ricardian and non-Ricardian regimes. In the latter, sovereign default risk drives the currency risk premium and affects how the exchange rate reacts to policy shocks.","2022-01-10","2023-11-29 09:25:24","2023-11-29 09:25:24","2023-11-29 09:25:24","","","","","","","","","","","","","Rochester, NY","en","","SSRN Scholarly Paper","","","Social Science Research Network","","","","C:\Users\Enzinger\Zotero\storage\72E9H762\Mirkov et al. - 2022 - Fiscal Regimes and the Exchange Rate.pdf","","","monetary policy; fiscal policy; exchange rate; fiscal dominance; sovereign default","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","4005017","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The core channels of policy transmission — the neoclassical links between short-term policy interest rates, other asset prices such as long-term interest rates, equity prices, and the exchange rate, and the consequent effects on household and business demand — have remained steady from early policy-oriented models (like the Penn-MIT-SSRC MPS model) to modern dynamic, stochastic general equilibrium (DSGE) models. In contrast, non-neoclassical channels, such as credit-based channels, have remained outside the core models. In conjunction with this evolution in theory and modeling, there have been notable changes in policy behavior (with policy more focused on price stability) and in the reduced form correlations of policy interest rates with activity in the United States. Regulatory effects on credit provision have also changed significantly. As a result, we review the empirical evidence on the changes in the effect of monetary policy actions on real activity and inflation and present new evidence, using both a relatively unrestricted factor-augmented vector autoregression (FAVAR) and a DSGE model. Both approaches yield similar results: Monetary policy innovations have a more muted effect on real activity and inflation in recent decades as compared to the effects before 1980. Our analysis suggests that these shifts are accounted for by changes in policy behavior and the effect of these changes on expectations, leaving little role for changes in underlying private-sector behavior (outside shifts related to monetary policy changes).","2010-01-01","2023-11-29 09:31:33","2023-11-29 09:31:33","2023-11-29 09:31:33","369-422","","","3","","","","","","","","Elsevier","","","","","","","ScienceDirect","","DOI: 10.1016/B978-0-444-53238-1.00008-9","","C:\Users\Enzinger\Zotero\storage\LGAHGLHM\Boivin et al. - 2010 - Chapter 8 - How Has the Monetary Transmission Mech.pdf; C:\Users\Enzinger\Zotero\storage\GKTDQ2YD\B9780444532381000089.html","","","Monetary Policy; Monetary Transmission; Stability","Friedman, Benjamin M.; Woodford, Michael","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We characterize the transmission of, and spillovers from, monetary policy shocks in this environment.","2020-03","2023-11-29 09:43:23","2023-11-29 09:43:23","2023-11-29 09:43:23","677-719","","3","110","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","www.aeaweb.org","","","","C:\Users\Enzinger\Zotero\storage\Q5YYKNT2\Gopinath et al. - 2020 - Dominant Currency Paradigm.pdf","","","Monetary Policy; Empirical Studies of Trade; Foreign Exchange; International Business Cycles","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Yet, research into this development has focused almost exclusively on advanced economies. This book fills that gap, providing the first comprehensive and systematic analysis of inflation in emerging market and developing economies. It examines how inflation has evolved and become synchronized among economies; what drives inflation globally and domestically; where inflation expectations have become better-anchored; and how exchange rate fluctuations can pass through to inflation. To reach its conclusions, the book employs cutting edge empirical approaches. It also offers a rich data set of multiple measures of inflation for a virtually global sample of countries over a half-century to spur further research into this important topic.","2019","2023-11-29 09:45:45","2023-11-29 09:45:45","2023-11-29 09:45:45","","","","","","","Inflation in Emerging and Developing Economies","","","","","Washington, DC: World Bank","","","","","","","openknowledge.worldbank.org","","DOI: 10.1596/978-1-4648-1375-7","","C:\Users\Enzinger\Zotero\storage\VMHY692U\Ha et al. - 2019 - Inflation in Emerging and Developing Economies Ev.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

As it doubles the number of observations over the next-largest publicly available sources, the database constitutes a comprehensive, single source for inflation series. It also illustrates the potential use of the database with three applications. First, it studies the evolution of inflation since 1970 and documents the broad-based disinflation around the world over the past half-century, with global consumer price inflation down from a peak of 16.9 percent in 1974 to 2.5 percent in 2020, before rising to 7.8 percent in 2022. Second, the paper analyzes the role of common factors in explaining movements in different measures of inflation. While, across all inflation measures, inflation synchronization has risen since the early 2000s, it has been much higher for inflation measures that involve a larger share of tradable goods. In addition, the paper examines the behavior of inflation during global recessions. Global inflation fell sharply (on average by 0.9 percentage points) in the year to the trough of global recessions and continued to decline even as recoveries got underway.","2023-10-01","2023-11-29 09:46:20","2023-11-29 09:46:20","2023-11-29 09:46:20","102896","","","137","","Journal of International Money and Finance","One-stop source","","","","","","","","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","C:\Users\Enzinger\Zotero\storage\VD7IWELE\Ha et al. - 2023 - One-stop source A global database of inflation.pdf; C:\Users\Enzinger\Zotero\storage\4ACICSVU\S0261560623000979.html","","","Prices; Deflation; Global factor; Global inflation; Inflation synchronization","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We find that a monetary policy shock can be described by two factors that have statistically significant effects on the financial market. A surprise monetary tightening has negative effects on stock returns and positive effects on government bond yields, even in the low-interest environment. We also find that the responses of the longer term yields tend to be larger than those of the shorter term yields. The response is the largest for the 10-year government bond yield, which has, in the last 2 decades, been effectively targeted by the Bank of Japan.

Using a Heterogeneous-Firm-New-Keynesian model, I estimate that the law relaxed firm collateral constraint by 13%.

This view is enshrined in standard textbooks: Robert Hall and John Taylor, for example, "" stress... that macro policy cannot influence the average rate of unemployment. It can only influence the fluctuations of unemployment around the natural rate. "" In this paper we raise questions about the validity of the natural rate hypothesis and argue that demand management policies can and do affect not just the variance, but also the mean, of output and unemployment. As a way of comparing the effectiveness of different demand management policies in stabilizing national economies, we return to the much-discussed comparison of macroeconomic performance in the United States and other industrial nations before and after World War II. Previous explorations of macroeconomic performance in historical perspective have focused either on the volatility of output about trends or on the volatility of changes in output.2 But volatility is not the relevant measure if, as Keynes and the early Keynesians believed, successful macroeconomic policies fill in troughs without shaving off peaks.","1988","2023-11-29 10:17:59","2023-11-29 10:20:11","2023-11-29 10:17:59","433-94","","","2","","","","","","","","","","en-US","","","","","","","","","C:\Users\Enzinger\Zotero\storage\6PMI6IP7\how-does-macroeconomic-policy-affect-output.html","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It finds that the disconnect is due primarily to the muted reaction of inflation to cost pressures, regardless of how they are measured—a flat aggregate supply curve. A shift in policy toward more forceful inflation stabilization also appears to have played some role by reducing the impact of demand shocks on the real economy.

Previous work has not examined the course of inflation over the disinflations. This paper finds responses of the inflation rate to the ""disinflations"" only in a specification where the effects of the policy are presumed to be permanent Moreover, the Volcker disinflation is found to be the only ""disinflation"" to reduce inflation permanently. The disinflation after the 1973 OPEC price increases was effective, but only temporarily. Other disinflations had negligible impacts on the rate of inflation over all horizons. Variables measuring the expected present discounted values of unemployment and inflation are constructed. These variables are used in a discrete-choice model to explain the Fed's decision to disinflate. This model does a fairly good job of explaining the Fed's decisions. Both inflation and unemployment drive the Fed's decision. For some episodes, notably in the 1970's, inflation is the main variable driving the decision.

It does so by examining two benchmark examples. In the first part, I discuss a generic example of demand and supply, seeking to identify a supply shock from price–quantity data. In the second part, I discuss a generic example of Bayesian vector autoregressions and the identification of a monetary supply shock. Along the way, I formulate some principles and present my view on some of the recent discussion and literature regarding sign restrictions.INTRODUCTIONThe approach of sign restrictions in time series analysis has generated an active literature, many successful applications, and a lively debate. The procedures are increasingly easy to use, with implementations in econometric software packages such as RATS or with ready-to-implement code in a variety of programming languages; see, e.g., Danne (2015) as one example. Let me say from the outset that I am very happy about that, including those contributions that have criticized my own work, sometimes sharply. Skepticism and critique is crucial for science to advance, so all power to them! That should not prevent me from critiquing back, of course, and that is partly what this chapter will be about. Debate is good.While Leamer (1981) surely deserves being highlighted here, I believe that the literature pretty much started with Dwyer (1998), Faust (1998) and its discussion, Uhlig (1998), Canova and Pina (1999), Canova and de Nicolo (2002), as well as my “agnostic identification” paper Uhlig (2005b). This one was published quite a number of years after my discussion of the Faust paper, but that discussion shows that I had already developed my methodology then, and that imposing sign restrictions on impulse responses and not just on impact can add considerable bite. There are deep connections to the seemingly different literature on partial identification and estimation subject to inequality restrictions: rather than review that literature, let me just point the reader to the excellent discussions on this topic by Canay and Shaikh (2017) as well as by Ho and Rosen (2017), appearing elsewhere in this volume, or, say, Kline and Tamer (2016).","2017","2023-11-30 10:55:14","2023-11-30 10:55:14","2023-11-30 10:55:14","95-127","","","2","","","","Econometric Society Monographs","","","","Cambridge University Press","Cambridge","","","","","","Cambridge University Press","","DOI: 10.1017/9781108227223.004","","C:\Users\Enzinger\Zotero\storage\Q7PJRK6K\7749787377BAED242C29E988A1D1144B.html","","","","Pakes, Ariel; Honoré, Bo; Samuelson, Larry; Piazzesi, Monika","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This cycle co‐moves with the VIX, a measure of uncertainty and risk aversion of the markets. Asset markets in countries with more credit inflows are more sensitive to the global cycle. The global financial cycle is not aligned with countries’ specific macroeconomic conditions. Symptoms can go from benign to large asset price bubbles and excess credit creation, which are among the best predictors of financial crises. A VAR analysis suggests that one of the determinants of the global financial cycle is monetary policy in the centre country, which affects leverage of global banks, capital flows and credit growth in the international financial system. Whenever capital is freely mobile, the global financial cycle constrains national monetary policies regardless of the exchange rate regime. For the past few decades, international macroeconomics has postulated the “trilemma”: with free capital mobility, independent monetary policies are feasible if and only if exchange rates are floating. The global financial cycle transforms the trilemma into a “dilemma” or an “irreconcilable duo”: independent monetary policies are possible if and only if the capital account is managed. So should policy restrict capital mobility? Gains to international capital flows have proved elusive whether in calibrated models or in the data. Large gross flows disrupt asset markets and financial intermediation, so the costs may be very large. To deal with the global financial cycle and the “dilemma”, we have the following policy options: ( a) targeted capital controls; (b) acting on one of the sources of the financial cycle itself, the monetary policy of the Fed and other main central banks; (c) acting on the transmission channel cyclically by limiting credit growth and leverage during the upturn of the cycle, using national macroprudential policies; (d) acting on the transmission channel structurally by imposing stricter limits on leverage for all financial intermediaries.","2015-05","2023-11-30 11:23:07","2023-11-30 11:23:07","2023-11-30 11:23:07","","","","","","","Dilemma not Trilemma","Working Paper Series","","","","National Bureau of Economic Research","","","","Working Paper","","","National Bureau of Economic Research","","DOI: 10.3386/w21162","","C:\Users\Enzinger\Zotero\storage\NR4CLF5D\Rey - 2015 - Dilemma not Trilemma The Global Financial Cycle a.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","21162","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This paper estimates a small structural vector autoregression (SVAR) model for Australia to examine the intertwined relationships of credit with other key macroeconomic variables. At short horizons, shocks to the interest rate, the exchange rate, and past shocks to credit are found to be important for credit growth. Over longer horizons, shocks to output, inflation and commodity prices play a greater role. The response of credit to changes in monetary policy is found to be relatively slow, similar to that of inflation and slower than that of output. The model suggests that an unexpected 25 basis point increase in the interest rate results in the level of credit being almost half of a percentage point lower than it otherwise would have been after a bit over one year, and almost 1 per cent lower after four years. Estimates from the model indicate that in responding to the macroeconomic consequences of a credit shock, monetary policy appears to stabilise the economy effectively. As a result of monetary policy's response, output and the exchange rate are barely affected by a credit shock. The credit shock results in higher inflation for about two years, but it would be higher still over this period in the absence of a monetary policy response. Changes in credit are also moderated as a result of monetary policy's response.","2005","2023-11-30 11:28:08","2023-11-30 11:28:43","2023-11-30 11:28:08","","","September","","","","Abstract for RDP 2005-06","","","","","","","en-AU","You may download, display, print or reproduce material on this website in unaltered form for your personal, non-commercial use within your organisation, with proper attribution given to the Reserve Bank of Australia.

The model we use is a modification of the small open economy model developed for the G6 economies (the G7 less the United States) by Kim and Roubini (1999). The success of the Kim and Roubini model across these economies makes it a natural starting point to analyse monetary policy in Australia. Consistent with Kim and Roubini, we find no evidence of the price or exchange rate puzzles identified in the literature. We demonstrate that, in the Australian context, modelling the interdependence between the domestic interest rate, the foreign interest rate and the nominal exchange rate is critical to resolving these puzzles. Further, we demonstrate that the Kim and Roubini model can be further usefully refined when applied to the Australian data. We use the model to perform various monetary policy experiments and the results of these experiments accord well with both the existing SVAR literature and previous empirical work for Australia. We find that monetary policy shocks have a delayed and gradual effect on the price level and a small temporary effect on output. We also use the model to examine the effects of shocks to the Australian economy and the role of monetary policy in response to these shocks. Generally, we find that monetary policy has served to dampen both output and price fluctuations. A qualifying aspect of our results is the model’s instability, for example, around the most recent change in the implementation of monetary policy in Australia.","","2023-11-30 11:31:40","2023-11-30 11:32:22","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","ResearchGate","","","","C:\Users\Enzinger\Zotero\storage\LCWW5GW7\Brischetto und Voss - 2000 - A Structural Vector Autoregression Model of Moneta.pdf; ","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/24120698_A_Structural_Vector_Autoregression_Model_of_Monetary_Policy_in_Australia","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We support this restriction with narrative evidence as well as empirical evidence from the extant literature. We find an unexpected increase in the policy rate to generate an immediate appreciation followed by a persistent depreciation. This evidence is consistent with the overshooting hypothesis. Importantly, we show that our identification strategy implies robust impulse responses across samples characterized by different monetary policy conducts.

The maximum and minimum target responses are obtained as each corresponds to a single monetary policy equation.

The model has four intermediate sectors: non-traded, housing, traded, and resources. Households are assumed to consume housing services as part of their consumption bundle and gain utility from holding housing stock. The utility specification increases households' willingness to hold housing stock and implies a relatively high sensitivity of housing investment to monetary policy. We estimate the model on Australian data and find that our model is better able to match a number of empirical regularities compared to a model without housing. These regularities include the sensitivity of housing investment to interest rates and the persistence of aggregate output's response to monetary policy shocks. We then use the model to explore the role of the housing sector in the rebalancing of the Australian economy following the end of the mining boom. First, we find that most of the recent increase in housing investment has been an endogenous response to the large fall in commodity prices and associated declines in interest rates. Second, the pick-up in housing investment has significantly supported the economy over the past five years, ading a ½ percentage point to GDP growth and a ¼ percentage point to inflation, in year-ended terms.","2018-04","2023-11-30 11:40:26","2023-11-30 11:40:26","2023-11-30 11:40:26","","","","","","","DSGE Reno","","","","RBA Research Discussion Papers","","","en","","","","","ideas.repec.org","","Number: rdp2018-04 Publisher: Reserve Bank of Australia","","C:\Users\Enzinger\Zotero\storage\JCQYFR5V\Gibbs et al. - 2018 - DSGE Reno Adding a Housing Block to a Small Open .pdf; C:\Users\Enzinger\Zotero\storage\ZJBC8BZB\rdp2018-04.html","","","DSGE; housing; monetary policy; open economy; residential investment","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This is in contrast to models that use recursive zero-type restrictions, for which inflation can rise following an unexpected interest rate increase while the exchange rate can appreciate or depreciate depending on the ordering of the variables. Sign-restricted VAR models seem to be able to overcome puzzles related to the real exchange rate, provided that a sufficient number of different types of shocks are identified. Despite delivering the correct sign of the impulse responses, central tendency measures of sign-restricted VAR models can, however, be misleading and hardly ever coincide with the true impulses.

Three types of shocks are identified based on their impact on commodity prices, global manufactured prices and global economic activity. The first two shocks, a world demand shock and a commodity-market-specific shock, are fairly standard. The third shock, a globalisation shock that may result, for instance, from the increasing importance of China, India and eastern Europe in the global economy, is more novel. The globalisation shock is associated with a decline in manufactured prices, a rise in commodity prices and an increase in global economic activity. Determining the underlying source of variation in the terms of trade is shown to be important for understanding the impact on the Australian economy as all three shocks propagate through the economy in different ways. The relative contribution of each shock to inflation, output, interest rates and the exchange rate has also varied over time. The main conclusion of the article is that a higher terms of trade tends to be expansionary but is not always inflationary. A key result is that the floating exchange rate has provided an important buffer to the external shocks that move the terms of trade.","2013","2023-11-30 11:45:25","2023-11-30 11:45:25","2023-11-30 11:45:25","145-159","","285","89","","","Terms of Trade Shocks","","","","","","","en","© 2013 Economic Society of Australia","","","","Wiley Online Library","","_eprint: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/1475-4932.12039","","C:\Users\Enzinger\Zotero\storage\D92873H8\1475-4932.html","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, it is hard to measure such effects owing to the difficulty in isolating credit supply shocks. This paper employs survey data to identify the impact of credit supply shocks in Australia over the past three decades, using a structural vector autoregression approach. We estimate that a one standard deviation shock to the balance of firms reporting difficulty obtaining finance (a 'credit supply shock') reduces Australian GDP by almost ⅓ per cent after one year and gross national expenditure by nearly ½ per cent. The effect on business credit is larger and more persistent, with credit declining by nearly 1 per cent relative to its baseline after two and a half years. During the global financial crisis, the cumulative impact of credit supply shocks is estimated to have contributed to a reduction in GDP of 1 per cent (in mid 2009). While credit supply shocks had a notable effect on GDP during the global financial crisis, this credit event appears to have been shorter and sharper than that experienced during the period of financial instability in the early 1990s. Consistent with a 'credit channel' of monetary policy transmission, an unexpected tightening of monetary policy results in a significant increase in the balance of firms reporting difficulty obtaining finance. We also find effects consistent with a financial accelerator mechanism, whereby an improvement in balance sheets results in easier credit conditions and higher GDP and business credit. Altogether, these results suggest that credit market developments have been an integral aspect of the business cycle in Australia since financial deregulation in the 1980s.","2012-05","2023-11-30 11:47:25","2023-11-30 11:47:25","2023-11-30 11:47:25","","","","","","","","","","","","Reserve Bank of Australia","","","","RBA Research Discussion Paper","","","RePEc - Econpapers","","","","C:\Users\Enzinger\Zotero\storage\MNH8HDPD\Jacobs und Rayner - 2012 - The Role of Credit Supply in the Australian Econom.pdf; C:\Users\Enzinger\Zotero\storage\2T6AATZD\rdp2012-02.html","","","credit; credit channel; financial accelerator; monetary policy","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
