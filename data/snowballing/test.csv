ref_037,3,3000,VQT8R3WD,"Abdulraheem, Maytham",The Macroeconomics of Housing in the US,2020,NA,NA,NA,thesis,"This dissertation studies the macroeconomics of housing in the US. It consists of two essays. The first essay examines the role the housing market has in the US business cycle. The second essay explores more the relationship between the housing market and the mortgage market with a special focus on the 2007-2009 financial crisis. The first essay studies the role of housing in the US economy since 1971. The focus is on the impact of the housing and mortgage markets on the business cycle and monetary transmission mechanisms. A ten variable TVP-SV-SVAR is used to address several issues. I study the effect of housing demand and supply shocks on the US business cycle and mortgage rates. Additionally, the impact of mortgage credit shocks on the US business cycle and the housing market is examined. Finally, I discuss the interactions between the US housing market and Fed monetary policy. The evidence shows: (i) housing demand shocks play only a small role in the US business cycle and in determining mortgage rates; (ii) housing supply shocks are more relevant to the 2007-2009 financial crisis than housing demand shocks; (iii) mortgage credit supply shocks have considerable effects on housing supply and inflation; (iv) monetary policy has a substantial effect on the US housing market since 1971. In the second essay, I estimate a SVAR with housing and mortgage markets to study the 2007-2009 financial crisis along three dimensions. First, the essay examines the links between the composition of mortgage-backed securities (MBS) and the US housing market in the run-up to the financial crisis. Second, the role liquidity shocks and GSEs played in triggering the financial crisis is explored. Third, I evaluate the effectiveness of the quantitative easing (QE) programs in reducing the mortgage spread. Five main findings emerge from the estimations. First, a shock to the private-label share of MBS generates an increase in house prices, especially in 2004-2006. Second, housing demand shocks raise private MBS issues relative to securities issued by the GSEs. This response is particularly strong from 2003 to 2006. Third, liquidity shocks are the most important driver of the commercial paper spread during the 2007-2009 financial crisis. Fourth, the GSEs role in the collapse of the MBS market is limited. Finally, the effect of QE programs on the mortgage spread is minimal.",NA,https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=eoh&AN=1935933&site=ehost-live,Abdulraheem_2020_the,1,0,0,0,https://repository.lib.ncsu.edu/bitstream/handle/1840.20/38330/etd.pdf?sequence=1,25/05/2023,VM,0,NA,1,NA,ph,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Extract IRF, Aleksandr",NA,NA,NA,NA,35

Design/methodology/approach: The authors use a FAVAR model that builds on Bernanke et al. (2005) and Boivin et al. (2009). The main assumption in this model is that the dynamics of a large set of macro variables are captured by some observed and unobserved common factors. The unobserved factors are extracted from a large set of macroeconomic data. The key advantage of using this model is that it allows extracting the impulse responses of a wide range of macroeconomic variables to structural shocks in the federal funds rate. Findings: The results indicate that industries exhibit differential responses to an unanticipated monetary policy tightening. In general, manufacturing industries appear to be more sensitive compared to mining, and utility industries and durable manufacturing industries are found to be more sensitive than those within nondurable and other manufacturing industries to a monetary policy shock. While all industries respond to the policy shock, most of the responses are reversed between 12 and 22 months.",10.1108/JES-04-2020-0153,https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=eoh&AN=1950833&site=ehost-live,Ahmad_2021_monetary,1,0,0,0,https://doi.org/10.1108/JES-04-2020-0153,03/07/2023,VM,0,NA,1,NA,ph,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,74

Deriving exact conditions we establish that, (i) in a two dimensional factor model only two out of potentially infinite sign restrictions are relevant and (ii) in contrast, in cases of higher dimension every additional sign restriction can be relevant improving structural identification. The latter result can render our approach a blessing in high dimensions.

In particular, as interest rates fall to very low levels, does the effectiveness of monetary policy in boosting the economy wane? We provide evidence consistent with this hypothesis.

The results hold even when controlling for potential confounding nonlinearities associated with debt levels and the business cycle as well as for the trend decline in equilibrium interest rates.

We find that nonfinancial credit is a vulnerability: impulses to the credit-to-GDP gap when it is high leads to a recession. Risk appetite leads to an economic expansion in the near-term, but also higher credit and a recession in later years, suggesting an intertemporal tradeoff.

We then quantify the policy contribution on GDP growth in the last decade by means of a structural counterfactual analysis based on conditional forecasts. We find that global GDP growth benefited from substantial policy support during the global financial crisis but policy tightening thereafter, particularly fiscal consolidation, acted as a significant drag on the subsequent global recovery. In addition we show that the role of policy has differed across countries.

Researchers frequently find evidence of a 'price puzzle': increases in the policy rate are followed by higher rather than lower inflation. This can be explained by the forward-looking behaviour of the central bank. Inflation does not rise in response to an increase in the policy rate but, instead, the central bank raises its policy rate when it expects inflation to increase in the future. To identify the true causal effects of monetary policy on inflation, it is hence necessary to control for this systematic policy response to expected inflation. For Australia, however, the price puzzle has been found even when controlling for the cash rate's systematic response to the Reserve Bank's own inflation forecasts. I argue that this is due to an additional but omitted systematic response of the cash rate to credit market shocks. Easier credit market conditions lead to an economic expansion and higher inflation. Therefore, the Bank raises the cash rate--its policy rate--when credit spreads decline. However, the Bank's inflation forecasts do not fully capture the inflationary effect of easier credit conditions. As a result, cash rate changes are positively correlated with future inflation even when purging them of the cash rate's response to the Bank's inflation forecasts. Accordingly, I show that accounting for the cash rate's additional response to credit market conditions resolves the price puzzle. As expected, a higher cash rate reduces inflation and output growth, and raises the unemployment rate.",NA,https://www.rba.gov.au/publications/rdp/2020/2020-01/the-effects-of-monetary-policy-shocks-on-inflation-unemployment-and-output.html,Beckers_2020_credit,1,0,0,0,https://econpapers.repec.org/paper/rbarbardp/rdp2020-01.htm,25/08/2023,VM,0,NA,1,NA,fp,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,1,NA,NA,NA,147

At short horizons, shocks to the interest rate, the exchange rate, and past shocks to credit are found to be important for credit growth. Over longer horizons, shocks to output, inflation and commodity prices play a greater role. The response of credit to changes in monetary policy is found to be relatively slow, similar to that of inflation and slower than that of output. The model suggests that an unexpected 25 basis point increase in the interest rate results in the level of credit being almost half of a percentage point lower than it otherwise would have been after a bit over one year, and almost 1 per cent lower after four years. Estimates from the model indicate that in responding to the macroeconomic consequences of a credit shock, monetary policy appears to stabilise the economy effectively. As a result of monetary policy's response, output and the exchange rate are barely affected by a credit shock.

ref_062,4,894,8DE3Y3IM,"Bianco, Timothy",Three Essays on Credit Markets and the Macroeconomy,2021,Journal of Macroeconomics,NA,NA,journalArticle,"Historically, credit market conditions have been shown to impact economic activity, at times severely. For instance, in the late 2000s, the United States experienced a financial crisis that seized domestic and foreign credit markets. The ensuing lack of access to credit brought about a steep decline in output and a sluggish recovery. Accordingly, policymakers commonly take steps to mitigate the effects of adverse credit market conditions and, at times, conduct unconventional monetary policy once traditional policy tools become ineffective. This dissertation is a collection of essays regarding monetary policy, the flow of credit, financial crises, and the macroeconomy. Specifically, I describe monetary policy's impact on the allocation of credit in the U.S. and analyze the role of upstream and downstream credit conditions and financial crises on international trade in a global supply chain. The first chapter assesses the impact of monetary policy shocks on credit reallocation and evaluates the importance of theoretical transmission mechanisms. Compustat data covering 1974 through 2017 is used to compute quarterly measures of credit flows. I find that expansionary monetary policy is associated with positive long-term credit creation and credit reallocation. These impacts are larger for long-term credit and for credit of financially constrained firms and firms that are perceived as risky to the lender. This is predicted by the balance sheet channel of monetary policy and mechanisms that reduce lenders' risk perceptions and increase the tendency to search for yield. Furthermore, I find that, on average, the largest increases in credit creation resulting from monetary expansion are to firms that exhibit relatively low investment efficiency. These estimation results suggest that expansionary monetary policy may have a negative impact on future economic growth. The second chapter evaluates the quantitative effects of unconventional monetary policy in the late 2000s and early 2010s. This was a period when the traditional monetary policy tool (the federal funds rate) was constrained by the zero lower bound. We compute credit flow measures using Compustat data, and we employ a factor augmented vector autoregression to analyze unconventional monetary policy's impact on the allocation of credit during the zero lower bound period. By employing policy counterfactuals, we find that unconventional monetary policy has a positive and simultaneous impact on credit creation and credit destruction and these impacts are larger in long-term credit markets. Applying this technique to analyze the flows of financially constrained and non-financially constrained borrowing firms, we find that unconventional monetary policy operates through the easing of collateral constraints because these effects are larger for small firms or those with high default probabilities. During the zero lower bound period, we also find that unconventional monetary policy brings about increases in credit creation for firms of relatively high investment efficiency. The third chapter pertains to the global trade collapse of the late 2000s. This collapse was due, in part, to strained credit markets and the vulnerability of exporters to adverse credit market conditions. The chapter evaluates the impact of upstream and downstream credit conditions and the differential effects of financial crises on bilateral trade. I find that upstream and downstream sectors' needs for external financing is negatively associated with trade flows when the exporting or importing country's cost of credit is high. However, I find that this effect is dampened for downstream sectors. I also find that downstream sectors' value of collateral is positively associated with trade when the cost of credit is high in the importing country. High downstream trade credit dependence coupled with high costs of credit in the importing country also cause declines in imports. There are amplifying effects of credit costs for sectors that are highly dependent on external financing when the importing or exporting country is in financial crisis. Further, the magnitude is larger when the exporting country is in financial crisis. Finally, I find that these effects on trade flows are large when the exporting country is a developed economy, but they are muted for developing economies.",NA,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S016407042100063X,Bianco_2018_three,1,0,0,0,https://uknowledge.uky.edu/economics_etds/38/,14/06/2023,VM,0,NA,1,NA,ph,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,59

And monetary policy shocks seem to have persistent effects on both relative prices and relative quantities, rather than the transitory effects one would expect from differences in price flexibility across goods.

However, many of these studies, in particular those using vector autoregressive (VARs) approaches, have disregarded the strong contemporaneous interaction between monetary policy and exchange rate movements by placing zero restrictions on them. In contrast, we achieve identification by imposing a long-run neutrality restriction on the real exchange rate, thereby allowing for contemporaneous interaction between the interest rate and the exchange rate. In a study of four open economies, we find that the puzzles disappear. In particular, a contractionary monetary policy shock has a strong effect on the exchange rate, which appreciates on impact.

In conjunction with this evolution in theory and modeling, there have been notable changes in policy behavior (with policy more focused on price stability) and in the reduced form correlations of policy interest rates with activity in the United States. Regulatory effects on credit provision have also changed significantly. As a result, we review the empirical evidence on the changes in the effect of monetary policy actions on real activity and inflation and present new evidence, using both a relatively unrestricted factor-augmented vector autoregression (FAVAR) and a DSGE model. Both approaches yield similar results: Monetary policy innovations have a more muted effect on real activity and inflation in recent decades as compared to the effects before 1980. Our analysis suggests that these shifts are accounted for by changes in policy behavior and the effect of these changes on expectations, leaving little role for changes in underlying private-sector behavior (outside shifts related to monetary policy changes).",NA,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780444532381000089,Boivin_2010_chapter,1,0,0,0,https://doi.org/10.1016/B978-0-444-53238-1.00008-9,06/07/2023,VM,0,NA,1,NA,me,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Transformation of non cumulative gr, Extract IRF",1,NA,NA,NA,97

I exploit, for the first time, the information content of the flow-of-funds statistics, representing the most complete framework for analysing the flows of funds moving from one sector (the lender) to the other (the borrower). I estimate a parsimonious recursive VAR in order to identify monetary policy shocks in the euro area. Its predictions as to the responses of the main economic aggregates are in line both with existing literature and with theoretical priors on the effects a monetary policy shock should produce, without suffering from the empirical puzzles that can be found in some previous works. The benchmark model is then extended to include the flow-of-funds variables. I find evidence of a certain degree of inertia in firms’ behaviour. In fact, following a policy tightening firms increase net funds raised at impact. Households adjust their financial investment and borrowing attitude quite rapidly after the shock, reducing the overall accumulation of financial assets and switching from deposits and mutual fund shares to short-term securities. Special attention is devoted to the impact of a policy tightening on loans to the private sector. As in previous studies on the euro-area economy, we find that an interest-rate hike is followed by an increase in loans granted to households and firms in the short run.

The model we use is a modification of the small open economy model developed for the G6 economies (the G7 less the United States) by Kim and Roubini (1999). The success of the Kim and Roubini model across these economies makes it a natural starting point to analyse monetary policy in Australia. Consistent with Kim and Roubini, we find no evidence of the price or exchange rate puzzles identified in the literature. We demonstrate that, in the Australian context, modelling the interdependence between the domestic interest rate, the foreign interest rate and the nominal exchange rate is critical to resolving these puzzles. Further, we demonstrate that the Kim and Roubini model can be further usefully refined when applied to the Australian data. We use the model to perform various monetary policy experiments and the results of these experiments accord well with both the existing SVAR literature and previous empirical work for Australia. We find that monetary policy shocks have a delayed and gradual effect on the price level and a small temporary effect on output. We also use the model to examine the effects of shocks to the Australian economy and the role of monetary policy in response to these shocks.

First, we design a framework in which fluctuations in households financial wealth are allowed—but not necessarily required—to exert an impact on current consumption. This is due to the interaction, in the financial markets, of long-time traders holding wealth accumulated over time with newcomers holding no wealth at all. Importantly, we introduce nominal wage stickiness to induce pro-cyclicality in real dividends. Additional nominal and real frictions are modeled to capture the pervasive macroeconomic persistence of the observables employed to estimate our model. We fit our model to post-WWII U.S. data, and report three main results. First, the data strongly support a significant role of stock prices in affecting real activity and the business cycle. Second, our estimates also identify a significant and counteractive response of the Fed to stock-price fluctuations. Third, we derive from our model a microfounded measure of financial slack, the “stock-price gap”, which we then contrast to alternative ones, currently used in empirical studies, to assess the properties of the latter to capture the dynamic and cyclical implications of our DSGE model. The behavior of our “stock-price gap” is consistent with the episodes of stock-market booms and busts occurred in the post-WWII, as reported by independent analyses, and closely correlates with the current financial meltdown. Typically employed proxies of financial slack such as detrended log-indexes or growth rates show limited capabilities of capturing the implications of our model-consistent index of financial stress.

Next to being interesting in their own right, our results are informative on the importance of various transmission mechanisms (as they are expected to vary systematically with the included characteristics). Rather than relying on standard monetary policy shock identification, we overcome the endogeneity problem by taking a differential approach (interacting our monetary policy measure with industry-level characteristics). Our results suggest that monetary contractions reduce output by more in industries featuring assets that are more difficult to collateralize (as predicted by the balance sheet channel) and in industries more reliant on international trade (as predicted by the exchange rate channel). Consistent with the financial accelerator mechanism, we find that the balance sheet channel becomes stronger during bad times.

ref_222,14,828,U6ZAQ4Z7,"Choquette, Jeremy",Three Papers in Applied Macroeconomics,2020,NA,NA,NA,thesis,"The first chapter of this dissertation addresses the impacts of monetary policy shocks on bank lending behavior in the United States and the role recessions play through a risk taking transmission mechanism. I employ a vector autoregression (VAR) identified with sign and zero restrictions to simulate a monetary policy shock implemented by the Federal Reserve consistent with the economic theory suggesting unconventional monetary policy measures. I find that banks respond to expansionary monetary policy shocks by taking additional risk through lowering lending standards, however banks still experience a compression in lending margins, indicating little success in their efforts to stabilize reductions in profits. I also include a number of counterfactual interest rates to allow Fed policy rates to reflect negative interest rate policies to compare monetary policy shocks across the conventional and unconventional monetary policy regimes in a consistent manner. I find that banks take less risk in the unconventional monetary policy regime relative to the conventional regime, however they experience a larger reduction in lending margins relative to the pre-Financial Crisis period. Use of a forecast error variance decomposition indicates the risk channel played a larger role in the post-Financial Crisis period, carrying implications for Fed policy in considering this particular transmission mechanism in unconventional monetary policy measures. The second chapter of this dissertation addresses the foreign central bank responses of 12 advanced economies and 12 emerging market economies to United States unconventional monetary policy shocks identified by a combination of sign and zero restrictions in a global vector autoregression (GVAR) framework. I find foreign central banks follow in kind with United States unconventional monetary policy measures, such as Quantitative Easing, in order to offset undesirable spillover effects. My results also indicate that United States Quantitative Easing plays a more substantial role in determining monetary easing conditions in emerging markets than in advanced economies. Additionally, I find foreign central banks with inflation targeting or floating exchange rate policies tend to follow a United States Quantitative Easing shock with more stable monetary policy responses, with larger increases in output than non-inflation targeting or managed exchange rate regimes. My results are robust to various changes in the specifications and identifying restrictions. The third chapter was written with Dr. Robert F. Tamura. We introduce a novel data set to empirically test a dynamic, dynastic human capital model developed by Tamura, Simon, and Murphy (2016), yielding predictions of the relative efficiency of school for black and white students during the Jim Crow era. By providing measures developed within the data set, we can test the parametrizations of key variables with respect to access to education calibrated within the model. Our results suggest that the model accurately describes the key educational values generated by the model, and confirms the results of the theoretical framework developed by Tamura, Simon, and Murphy (2016) in that blacks faced substantially higher marginal costs of education relative to whites as a result of the lack of equal per-pupil expenditures allocated at the state level during segregation, lower levels of human capital accumulation of African American parents relative to white parents, and the disparity of income across both races. This paper contributes to the literature by presenting a novel data set regarding expenditures per pupil for white and African American students for the years 1890-1960, and also confirming the fit of the model developed by Tamura, Simon, and Murphy (2016).",NA,https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=eoh&AN=1868584&site=ehost-live,Choquette_2020_three,1,0,0,0,https://tigerprints.clemson.edu/all_dissertations/2646/,01/09/2023,VM,0,NA,1,NA,dr,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,1,NA,NA,NA,208

A possible remedy recently proposed in the literature is to introduce a shadow short rate (SSR) obtained from the yield curve model as an alternative monetary policy measure. This paper examines the usefulness of shadow rates as a policy stance measure for the Euro area. Moreover, the SSR canbe used to study the country-specific monetary policy stance. We incorporate the shadow short rate in a standard vector autoregressive analysis to study the effects of monetary policy shocks both at the level of the Euro area and for two periphery EA countries, Italy and Spain, that endured significant financial stress during the crisis. Our analysis shows that monetary policy shocks identified form the SSR produce similar macro responses as shocks identified from the standard policy rate. The Euro area shocks can directly translate to a corresponding change in the country-specific financing conditions in the periphery, whereas the reverse effect is limited. The historical decomposition of the stochastic component of the SSR series shows that the unconventional policy measures were effective in stabilising the sovereign crisis in 2011, however, their relatively limited quantity provided only a weak stimulus to the economy.",10.1007/s10663-016-9328-4,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10663-016-9328-4,Damjanović_2016_shadow,1,0,0,0,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10663-016-9328-4,09/10/2023,VM,0,NA,1,NA,ph,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,245

To do this, six diﬀerent Structural VAR models are estimated on US quarterly data for the period 1970-2020. The estimations suggest that the own interest rate (Sraﬀa, 1932; Teixeira, 2015) produces more persistent and statistically signiﬁcant eﬀects on autonomous consumption and on output than the real interest rate. The implication of these results is twofold. First, these ﬁndings conﬁrm the hypothesis that monetary policy transmission passes through autonomous consumption, in particular via changes in house prices. Second, the persistence of the eﬀect of autonomous consumption on output reaﬃrms its long run implications that goes beyond the business cycle, in line with the recent literature on autonomous demand-led growth. Furthermore, after the inclusion of rents and the overall price level, a positive monetary policy shock leads to an increase in rents, while housing prices decrease and the overall price level increases, giving a possible explanation of the Gibson’s Paradox. This contradictory movement in rent prices explains part of the price puzzle since shelter has a signiﬁcant impact as one of the main components of the Consumer Price Index (Dias and Duarte, 2019). These latter results open a path for the discussion of the linkages between monetary policy and distribution, since recent expansionary monetary policy did not fail to translate into worsening house aﬀordability leading to a decrease in home-ownership (particularly aﬀecting lower-income households).

Credit flows and the instability of credit appear to be at the root of the financial instability problem. On the other hand, some authors recently questioned whether a too early and too strong leaning against the wind policy by central banks might have higher costs than benefits in terms of output and employment losses. In our paper, we include in an inflation targeting model a financial stabilization goal. In contrast to infinite horizon and two-period models, we propose a finite horizon model. The model is solved by using a new global solution algorithm, called Nonlinear Model Predictive Control (NMPC), exploring stabilizing/destabilizing effects of price and nonprice (credit volume) drivers of the output gap, inflation, and credit flows. We substantiate the theoretical part of the paper by approaching the subject empirically, relying to that end on a regime-switching structural vector autoregressive (VAR) for the euro area. The empirical model contains standard macroeconomic variables along with credit flows and loan interest rates, the central bank policy rate, and European Central Bank (ECB) balance sheet variables. The regime-switching feature of the model is meant to capture the state-dependent relationship between the variables, with specific nonlinearities having direct counterparts in the theoretical model.

The theoretical model motivates our empirical assessment, based on a regime-switching Phillips curve and a regime-switching monetary structural VAR, employing different filter-based, semi-structural model-based and Bayesian factor model-implied output gaps. The analysis confirms the presence of a convex relationship between inflation and the output gap, meaning that the coefficient in the Phillips curve on the output gap recurringly increases during times of expansion and abates during recessions. Sign-restricted monetary policy shocks based on a regime-switching monetary SVAR reveal that expansionary monetary policy induces less pressure on inflation at times of weak as opposed to strong growth; thereby rationalizing relatively stronger expansionary policy, including unconventional volume-based policy, during times of deep recession.

The empirical evidence suggests that a U.S. monetary contraction leads to an immediate rise in the broad commodity price index, which possibly reflects an aggregation bias, greater expected inflation and speculation, high production costs or some overshooting due to overreactions. Then, the response erodes after six quarters as the positive interest rate shock vanishes and higher interest rates and liquidity drainage take traction. Despite this, the aggregate price response masks the existence of significant heterogeneity in the price responses of the different types of commodity sectors. More specifically, a positive interest rate shock leads to: (i) an initial pop in the price returns of the non-fuel commodities, which later reverses path and becomes negative (as in the case of the prices of agricultural raw materials); (ii) a positive and persistent rise in the volatile food prices; (iii) a fall in the beverage prices; and (iv) a persistent reduction in the prices of metals and the prices of energy prices.

These results are robust to alternative definitions of leveraging and deleveraging periods, different ways of identifying monetary policy shocks, controlling for the state of the business cycle, the level of households debt, and financial stress. To provide a structural interpretation for these empirical findings, we estimate a monetary DSGE model with financial frictions and occasionally binding collateral constraints. The model estimates reveal that household deleveraging periods in the data on average coincide with periods of binding collateral constraints whereas constraints tend to turn slack during leveraging episodes.

Macroeconomic stabilization through monetary policy may therefore have become associated with greater fluctuations in credit and housing markets, whereas stabilizing credit and house prices may have become less costly in terms of macroeconomic volatility. These changes in the aggregate impact of monetary policy can be explained by several important changes in the monetary transmission mechanism and in the composition of macroeconomic and credit aggregates. In particular, the stronger impact of monetary policy on credit is driven by a much higher responsiveness of mortgage credit and a larger share of mortgages in total credit since the 1980s.",NA,https://papers.ssrn.com/abstract=2996285,Hofmann_2017_monetary,1,0,0,0,https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2996285,28/08/2023,VM,0,NA,1,NA,ph,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,407

However, it is hard to measure such effects owing to the difficulty in isolating credit supply shocks. This paper employs survey data to identify the impact of credit supply shocks in Australia over the past three decades, using a structural vector autoregression approach. We estimate that a one standard deviation shock to the balance of firms reporting difficulty obtaining finance (a 'credit supply shock') reduces Australian GDP by almost 1/3 per cent after one year and gross national expenditure by nearly 1/2 per cent. The effect on business credit is larger and more persistent, with credit declining by nearly 1 per cent relative to its baseline after two and a half years. During the global financial crisis, the cumulative impact of credit supply shocks is estimated to have contributed to a reduction in GDP of 1 per cent (in mid 2009). While credit supply shocks had a notable effect on GDP during the global financial crisis, this credit event appears to have been shorter and sharper than that experienced during the period of financial instability in the early 1990s. Consistent with a 'credit channel' of monetary policy transmission, an unexpected tightening of monetary policy results in a significant increase in the balance of firms reporting difficulty obtaining finance. We also find effects consistent with a financial accelerator mechanism, whereby an improvement in balance sheets results in easier credit conditions and higher GDP and business credit.

The effects of monetary policy on lending activity are fairly limited, although there is some evidence that it affects lending rates more than loan volumes. Monetary policy shocks have strong effects on inflation, while the central bank reacts strongly to adverse shocks hitting the economy. Baseline results are confirmed by several robustness checks. According to historical decomposition, the lending activity was supporting economic growth before and during the crisis, but its contribution became negative during the recovery and it was a drag on growth until the end of the period. Pre-crisis GDP growth is mostly explained by supportive monetary policy. However, the restrictive monetary policy during the crisis contributed to the fall of GDP, before becoming supportive again during the early stages of the recovery.

Positive interest rate shocks appreciate the domestic currency and decrease the inflation whereas positive risk premium shocks cause a depreciation and an increase in inflation. Both of these shocks also cause a decrease in the domestic activity. Being an open and internationally integrated economy, Turkey is significantly affected by global shocks. A positive global demand innovation leads to an increase in global commodity prices, which together increase both the level of prices and economic activity in Turkey.

Moreover, evidence in favor of the non-stationarity of the markup is presented, which in turn implies that per capita hours are also non-stationary. Structural vector autoregressions are then constructed that can identify shocks to the markup, technology and the federal funds rate. The results show that (1) inflation responds immediately to shocks to the markup and technology whereas it displays a hump-shaped response to a monetary policy shock, and that (2) per capita hours decline in response to positive shocks to the markup and technology. These empirical findings have important implications for macroeconomic dynamics, including the issues on inflation inertia and the technology-hours debate. The paper also points out that the dynamics of the economy cannot be correctly explained without consideration of the permanent markup shock.

Motivated by evidence from psychology, unemployment is modeled as a social norm. The norm is defined here as the belief that individuals in society prioritize, or should prioritize the search for gainful employment, whereas those who do not are perceived as outside the norm and, consequently, stigmatized. Households pressure the unemployed to find jobs: the fewer unemployed workers there are, the more supporters the norm has and therefore the greater the pressure and psychological cost experienced by each jobseeker. As this psychological cost is procyclical, it hinders the wage from absorbing most of the effect of the shock. Thus, the model is able to capture the high volatility of vacancies and unemployment observed in the data, accounting for the Shimer puzzle.

This paper addresses this issue using a staggered price model with trend inflation, a smoothed-off kink in demand curves, and a fixed cost of production. In this model, inflation exhibits a persistent response to a policy shock even in the absence of its intrinsic inertia, because the kink causes a measure of price dispersion, which is intrinsically inertial, to become a key source of inflation persistence under the positive trend inflation rate. In addition, output and labor productivity both rise after an expansionary policy shock as in an estimated structural vector autoregression model.

The first one is the difficulty to identify the most appropriate indicator of monetary policy stance, which is usually assumed rather than determined from an estimated model. The second one is the fact that monetary policy decisions are based on the analysis of a wide range of economic and financial data, which is at odds with the small number of variables specified in most VAR models. To overcome the first issue, Bernanke and Mihov (1998) proposed a semi-structural VAR model from which the indicator of monetary policy stance can be derived rather than assumed. Meanwhile, the data problem has been resolved recently by Bernanke, Boivin and Eliasz (2005) using a Factor-Augmented Vector Autoregressive (FAVAR) model. In order to capture these two issues simultaneously, we propose an extension of the FAVAR model that incorporates a semi-structural identification approach a la Bernanke and Mihov, resulting in a VAR model that we denominate SS-FAVAR. Using data for Peru, the results show that the SS-FAVAR's impulse-response functions (IRFs) provide a more coherent picture of the effects of monetary policy shocks compared to the IRFs of alternative VAR models. Furthermore, it is found that innovations to nonborrowed reserves can be identified as monetary policy shocks for the period 1995-2003.",NA,NA,Lahura_NA_the,1,0,0,0,https://econpapers.repec.org/paper/rbpwpaper/2010-008.htm,06/07/2023,VM,0,biblio_edit,1,NA,me,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Extract IRF, Christian",1,NA,NA,NA,89

I use this information to construct an informationally-robust instrument for monetary policy shocks as the component of high-frequency market surprises triggered by policy announcements that is orthogonal to both central bank's economic projections, including policy rate projections, and to past market surprises.

While conventional impulse response analysis is restricted to evaluation using the conditional mean function, here, we propose an alternative impulse response analysis that traces the effect of economic shocks on the conditional quantile function. By changing the quantile index over the unit interval, it is possible to measure the effect of shocks on the entire conditional distribution of a variable of interest in our framework. Therefore we can observe the complete distributional consequences of policy interventions, especially at the upper and lower tails of the distribution as well as at the mean. Using the new approach, it becomes possible to evaluate two distinct features (called “distributional effects”): (i) a change in the dispersion of the conditional distribution of interest after a shock, and (ii) a change in the degree of skewness of the conditional distribution caused by a policy intervention. None of these features can be observed in the conventional impulse response analysis exclusively based on the conditional mean function. In addition to proposing the QIRF, our second contribution is to present a new way to jointly estimate a system of multiple quantile functions. Our proposed system quantile estimator is obtained by extending the result of Jun and Pinkse (2009) to the time series context.

For this, a structural vector autoregression identified with short-run restrictions was employed for each country with fund rate as US monetary policy instrument, non-oil output growth, and inflation. The main results that are of interest to decision makers suggest that (i) with respect to inflation, AGCC countries show synchronized responses to monetary policy shocks from the US and these responses are similar to US own inflation; (ii) with respect to non-oil output growth, there is no clear indication that US monetary policy can do as good of a job for AGCC countries as it has done at home. Therefore, importing monetary policy from the United States via a dollar peg may guarantee stable inflation for AGCC countries but not necessarily stable non-oil output growth. To the extent that the non-oil output response is taken seriously and there are concerns over the dollar's ability to perform its role as a store of value, a basket peg with both the US dollar and the Euro may be a sound alternative as confirmed by the variance decomposition analysis of our augmented SVAR with a proxy for the European short-term interest rate.",NA,https://mpra.ub.uni-muenchen.de/11610/,Louis_2007_on,1,0,0,0,https://mpra.ub.uni-muenchen.de/11610/,25/05/2023,VM,0,NA,1,NA,ph,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Extract IRF, Aleksandr",NA,NA,NA,NA,36

We apply the methodology to statements released by the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) after its policy meetings starting in 1999. Using intra-day financial quotes, we find that short-term nominal Treasury yields respond to changes in policy rates around policy announcements, whereas longer-dated Treasuries mainly react to changes in policy communication. Using lower frequency data, we find that changes in the content of the statements lead policy rate decisions by more than a year in univariate interest rate forecasting and vector autoregression (VAR) models. When we estimate Treasury yield responses to the shocks identified in the VAR, we find communication to be a more important determinant of Treasury rates than contemporaneous policy rate decisions. These results are consistent with the view that the FOMC releases information about future policy rate actions in its statements and that market participants incorporate this information when pricing longer-dated Treasuries. Finally, we decompose realized policy rate decisions using a forward-looking Taylor rule model. Based on this decomposition, we find that FOMC statements contain significant information regarding both the predicted rule-based interest rate and the Taylor-rule residual component, and that content of the statements leads the residual by a few quarters.",10.3386/w15367,https://www.nber.org/papers/w15367,Lucca_2009_measuring,1,0,0,0,https://ftrebbi.com/research/lt.pdf,01/12/2023,ME,0,biblio_edit_newer,1,NA,me,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,extract irf,1,NA,1,222,386

The literature on inflation dynamics and monetary policy focuses on developed economies, with little attention devoted to the African economies, which is potentially explained by the fact that in the past monetary policy played second fiddle because of fiscal policy dominance following episodes of high inflation and stabilisation policies that occurred in the 1980’s. This thesis fills an important gap in assessing African’s monetary policy. The thesis predominantly uses the Vector-Autoregression (VAR) framework to examine the monetary policy frameworks of the African economies. The thesis finds that an interest rate shock on average explain a more significant proportion of the variance in the output gap and inflation than the exchange rate, in terms of analysing the decomposition of shocks to the economy. This shows a shift in the monetary policy focus away from exchange rate management to interest rate targeting as the African economies have become more market oriented. The monetary policy reveal strong asymmetric responses with respect to the macroeconomic variables when inflation exceeds its threshold value. The analysis suggests that monetary policy in the African economies is regime-dependent, propagated through the inflation thresholds, such that the authorities strongly implement policy changes when inflation goes beyond a certain threshold. The thesis reveals that by taking into account the prior belief of the monetary authorities, it helps produce better estimates of the performance of the monetary policy transmission mechanism, as it combines prior information with the sampling information which is contained in the data. The overall novelty of the thesis is that some African economies are adopting inflation targeting policies instead of exchange rate management. It is imperative that the subsequent inflation targeting frameworks will achieve monetary policy objectives for the African economies and the use of interest rate management should be continued.",NA,NA,Moleka_NA_inﬂation,1,0,0,0,https://purehost.bath.ac.uk/ws/portalfiles/portal/187919327/Moleka_Elvis_Ph.D._Thesis_28_10_2015.pdf,01/09/2023,VM,0,NA,1,NA,dr,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,1,NA,NA,NA,209

We find that an increase in the federal funds rate causes the euro to immediately depreciate, while commodity, and in particular oil, prices decline sharply, reflecting a decline in demand. Lower commodity prices stimulate household consumption in the short run, and the higher aggregate demand induces an expansion of eurozone economic activity. Our results show that the effects of changes in the federal funds rate on commodity prices are greater than previously found in the literature. Our analysis also assesses the likely effects on the eurozone economy of the European Central Bank's (ECB's) own responses to macroeconomic developments.

Based on vector autoregressive models with (i) recursive identification and (ii) sign restrictions, we show that banks react aggressively to an expansionary monetary policy shock by lowering their lending standards.

Design/methodology/approach The joint effects of monetary and fiscal policy are analyzed by applying short-run contemporaneous restrictions for the identification of shocks in an SVAR in order to derive impulse response functions. Hence, a general AB model of (Amisano and Giannini, 1997) identification scheme, which is not recursive, is employed in this study. Findings The author shows that monetary tightening leads to a fall in real economic activity and depreciates the exchange rate. And in regard to the fiscal policy, the author calculates an initial government spending multiplier of 0.20, which later peaks at 0.40. The tax multiplier is almost 0 on impact and statistically insignificant. However, the author finds evidence supporting the existence of accommodative stance between monetary policy and fiscal policy, which is important for economic and political decision-making. Originality/value Empirical studies that deal with the joint effects of monetary and fiscal policy for South Africa through the SVAR framework are quite limited.

R.",A New Monetary Policy Shock with Text Analysis,2021,NA,NA,NA,report,"Measures of monetary shocks commonly give rise to the puzzling result where a monetary tightening has an expansionary effect. A possible reason is that agents may believe that monetary shocks contain information regarding the central bank’s assessment of the economic environment (Nakamura and Steinsson, 2018). Under this hypothesis, the estimated response to monetary policy shocks would contain two conflating effects: the actual effect of monetary policy and the reaction of private agents to the newly acquired information. This paper overcomes this problem by extracting a novel series of monetary shocks using text analysis methods on central bank documents. The resulting text-based variables contain the informational content from changes in the policy rate. Thus, they can be used to extract exogenous changes in monetary policy that are orthogonal to any central bank information. Using this information-free measure of monetary policy shocks reveals that a monetary tightening is not expansionary, even when estimated on more recent periods.",NA,https://www.repository.cam.ac.uk/handle/1810/327031,Ochs_2021_a,1,0,0,0,https://econpapers.repec.org/paper/camcamdae/2148.htm,28/08/2023,VM,0,NA,1,NA,ph,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,172

We identify a generic business cycle shock to deal with the endogenous movement of fiscal variables along with a monetary policy shock to absorb the variations due to those shocks. Both unanticipated and anticipated fiscal shocks, that is, government expenditure and revenue shocks, are also identified by minimal sign restrictions. In identifying those shocks, we do not impose any restrictions on the sign of the key variable of interest. We find that private investment and consumption significantly increase due to expansionary government expenditure shock. Such an increase in private consumption is consistent with neo-Keynesian prediction. The fall in output due to the tax increase shock is highly robust. Private consumption also decreases due to a tax increase, although investment does not. The results suggest that fiscal policy, especially tax policy, is more effective than monetary policy in stabilizing output.

More importantly, central banks adjust policy in response to a wide range of information about future economic developments. As a result, estimates of the effects of monetary policy derived using conventional measures will tend to be biased. To address this problem, we develop a new measure of monetary policy shocks in the United States for the period 1969 to 1996 that is relatively free of endogenous and anticipatory movements. The derivation of the new measure has two key elements. First, to address the problem of forward-looking behavior, we control for the Federal Reserve's forecasts of output and inflation prepared for scheduled FOMC meetings. We remove from our measure policy actions that are a systematic response to the Federal Reserve's anticipations of future developments. Second, to address the problem of endogeneity and to ensure that the forecasts capture the main information the Federal Reserve had at the times decisions were made, we consider only changes in the Federal Reserve's intentions for the federal funds rate around scheduled FOMC meetings. This series on intended changes is derived using information on the expected funds rate from the records of the Open Market Manager and information on intentions from the narrative records of FOMC meetings. The series covers the entire period for which forecasts are available, including times when the Federal Reserve was not exclusively targeting the funds rate. Estimates of the effects of monetary policy obtained using the new measure indicate that policy has large, relatively rapid, and statistically significant effects on both output and inflation. We find that the effects using the new measure are substantially stronger and quicker than those using prior measures. This suggests that previous measures of policy shocks are significantly contaminated by forward-looking Federal Reserve behavior and endogeneity.",NA,https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=eoh&AN=0714256&site=ehost-live,Romer_2004_a,1,0,0,0,https://www.jstor.org/stable/3592805,14/06/2023,VM,0,NA,1,NA,ph,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Extract IRF, Titus",NA,NA,NA,NA,58

The responses of housing variables to both types of shocks are stronger in countries with more developed mortgage markets, roughly doubling the responses to a monetary policy shock.

The strength of these forces varies across households depending on their marginal propensities to consume, their balance sheet composition, the sensitivity of their own earnings to fluctuations in aggregate labor income, and the responsiveness of aggregate earnings, asset prices and inflation to monetary policy shocks. We quantify all these channels in the euro area by combining micro data from the HFCS and the EU-LFS with structural VARs estimated on aggregate time series.

In this paper we examine the exchange rate channel in the MTM in Germany by estimating an identified VAR model. Two features of the results are highlighted.

ref_113,8,3870,ZR6BLXTL,"Tugan, Mustafa",Three Essays on Heterogeneity in Sectoral Price Flexibility,2014,NA,NA,NA,thesis,"This thesis focuses on the heterogeneity of price flexibility among sectors. For instance, does a multi sector model in which the frequency of price changes differs among sectors predict radically different dynamics for aggregate variables following a monetary policy shock than a one-sector model in which sectors are assumed to be homogenous in their frequencies of price changes? Is there any relative price effect of the shocks to monetary policy? If there is, can this relative price effect be related to the heterogeneity of the frequency of price changes among sectors? What insights can be gained if dynamic stochastic open-economy models are elaborated by including the heterogeneity of price flexibility among sectors? These questions are among the types of the questions that I address in this thesis. This thesis consists of three papers. The first paper studies the effects of a monetary policy shock on output, inflation and the real-wage in the United States. Next, the dynamics of these aggregate variables as predicted by the one- and multi-sector dynamic stochastic general equilibrium (DSGE) models are compared. The main finding is that the dynamics as predicted by the multi-sector model are quite similar to those as predicted by the one-sector model. The second paper focuses mostly on the effects of shocks to the federal funds rate on disaggregated sectors' prices in the United States. The two main empirical findings in this chapter are the substantial heterogeneity in sectoral price responses to the shock and that the price responses in sectors are only weakly associated with their frequency of price changes. The third paper, jointly written with Emek Karaca, is concerned with the effects of positive monetary shocks on output, the real exchange rate and the price level in developing countries which have adopted an inflation targeting regime. We find that such shocks are associated with a temporary rise in output; a temporary depreciation in the real exchange rate and a sizable contemporaneous increase in the price level in those economies.",NA,https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=eoh&AN=1470812&site=ehost-live,Tugan_2014_three,1,0,0,0,https://open.library.ubc.ca/soa/cIRcle/collections/ubctheses/24/items/1.0165879,15/08/2023,VM,0,NA,1,NA,me,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Transformation gr effect size, extract IRF",1,NA,NA,NA,107

We run SVARs with the monetary policy instrument, the stock index, and the macroeconomic variables and show the impulse responses of the stock index to the monetary policy shocks. After comparing two restriction schemes, the short-run Cholesky restrictions and the short-run and long-run combined restrictions for identification, we conclude that the latter restriction method leads to better estimation than the former one. In general, a contractionary monetary policy shock lowers the stock price, appreciates the Chinese currency, reduces the output gap, injects deflation, and shrinks the commodity price gap.

Such analyses typically require strong assumptions. Moreover, specific changes could have off-setting effects regarding the overall effectiveness of monetary policy. In order to shed light on this issue, we investigate whether there has been a significant change in the overall transmission of monetary policy to inflation and output by estimating a standard Vector Autoregression (VAR) for the euro area and by endogenously searching for possible break dates. We find a significant break point around 1996 and some evidence for a second one around 1999. We compare the effects of monetary policy shocks for these episodes and find that the well-known 'stylized facts' of monetary policy transmission remain valid.

ref_098,6,147,3X48J8NE,"White, Neil","Essays on Labor Market, Monetary Policy, and Uncertainty",2018,NA,NA,NA,thesis,"This dissertation examines the impacts on the labor market of monetary policy and macroeconomic uncertainty. The first chapter examines how monetary policy shocks in the U.S. affect the flows of workers among three labor market categories--employment, unemployment, and non-participation--and assesses each flow's relative importance to changes in labor market ""stock"" variables like the unemployment rate. I find that job loss accounts for the largest portion of monetary policy's effect on labor markets. I develop a New Keynesian model that incorporates these channels and show how a central bank can achieve welfare gains from targeting job loss, rather than output, in an otherwise standard Taylor rule. The second chapter examines the role of monetary policy in ""job polarization."" I argue that contractionary monetary policy has accelerated the decline of employment in routine occupations, which largely affected workers with a high-school degree but no college. In part by disproportionately affecting industries with high shares of routine occupations, contractionary monetary policy shocks lead to large and persistent shifts away from routine employment. Expansionary shocks, on the other hand, have little effect on these industries. Indeed, monetary policy's effect on overall employment is concentrated in routine jobs. These results highlight monetary policy's role in generating fluctuations not only in the level of employment, but also the composition of employment across occupations and industries. The third chapter introduces new direct measures of uncertainty derived from the Michigan Survey of Consumers. The series underlying these new measures are more strongly correlated with economic activity than many other series that are the basis for uncertainty proxies. The survey also facilitates comparison with response dispersion or disagreement, a commonly used proxy for uncertainty in the literature. Dispersion measures have low or negative correlation with direct measures of uncertainty and often have causal effects of opposite sign, suggesting that they are poor proxies for uncertainty. For the measures based on series most closely correlated with economic activity, positive uncertainty shocks are mildly expansionary. This result is robust across identification and estimation strategies and is consistent with ""growth options"" theories of the effects of uncertainty.",NA,https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=eoh&AN=1747535&site=ehost-live,White_2018_essays,1,0,0,0,http://hdl.handle.net/2152/65845,06/07/2023,VM,0,NA,1,NA,me,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,1,NA,NA,NA,95

We find that the maximal appreciation of the exchange rate occurs within 3–4 months during most of the period, providing favorable evidence to support Dornbusch’s (1976) overshooting hypothesis.",10.1016/j.frl.2021.102114,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1544612321001951,Yang_2021_effects,1,0,0,0,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.frl.2021.102114,10/10/2023,VM,0,NA,1,NA,ph,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,262

This study investigates the information effects of monetary policy announcements on oil prices using a structural vector autoregression (VAR) model identified by sign restrictions. The sign restrictions rely on the high-frequency linkage between stock prices and interest rates surrounding the policy announcements. We find that a positive central bank information shock, which raises the interest rate by six basis points, leads to a 1.7% increase in oil prices within two months. We also find that central bank information shocks affect oil prices through the finance and expectation channels.",10.1016/j.jcomm.2022.100268,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2405851322000265,Yang_2022_information,1,0,0,0,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcomm.2022.100268,21/08/2023,ME,0,NA,1,NA,me,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,extract IRF,1,NA,NA,NA,114

The results show large and persistent effects of monetary policy shocks on the domestic economy and point to the critical role of exchange rates and term premia. The analysis resolves important empirical puzzles of traditional recursive identification methods.

(2005) with Greenbook measures of the Federal Reserve's information set as in Romer and Romer (2004), I propose a new method of constructing a monetary policy shock that occurs on Federal Reserve announcement days. I provide substantial evidence that the new monetary policy shock is consistent with the predictions of workhorse macroeconomic models for structural monetary policy shocks. The new shock has large and highly statistically significant instantaneous effects on the Treasury yield curve. Using the shock as an external instrument in a VAR analysis, I find that contractionary monetary policy has modest downward effects on both output and inflation over business-cycle frequencies.",NA,https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=eoh&AN=1945314&site=ehost-live,Zhang_2021_a,1,0,0,0,https://www.bankofcanada.ca/2021/06/staff-working-paper-2021-29/?theme_mode=light,15/06/2023,VM,0,NA,1,NA,ph,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Extract IRF, Christian",NA,NA,NA,NA,65

The empirical results show that the nominal interest rate reacts not only to inflation and output gap, but also to the changes in RMB exchange rate. Moreover, the indeterminacy in the macro-dynamics indicates the instability in China's monetary policy, and it stems from two sources, the sunspot shock and the indeterminate propagation of fundamental shocks. In addition, we find that the monetary policy shock affects macroeconomic dynamics significantly in the short run, while in the long run, it only influences nominal variables, such as the inflation and the exchange rate, but not the real output.",NA,https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=eoh&AN=1379750&site=ehost-live,Zheng_2013_estimating,1,0,0,0,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.econmod.2013.01.002,06/07/2023,VM,0,sh,1,NA,me,NA,NA,NA,NA,1,NA,"Transformation of non cumulative logdiff, Extract IRF",1,"in the paper they calculates the annualized output gap, therefore coded as logdiff_a_rgap.",NA,NA,96

While GCC states peg their currency to the US dollar, the contemporaneous coefficient in the structural model indicates that for GCC countries a monetary policy instrument responds positively to unexpected increases in M2, while a monetary aggregate reacts negatively to interest rate shocks. However, our findings indicate that these countries' interest rate channel is weak. Furthermore, oil price innovation contributes to most output fluctuations in the short horizon, and M2 and Federal Fund Rates shocks are responsible for most output movements in the long horizon.",NA,https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/document?repid=rep1&type=pdf&doi=ed42691d205950313438dc5d3cef397625b1348d,Ziaei_2013_evaluating,1,0,0,0,https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/document?repid=rep1&type=pdf&doi=ed42691d205950313438dc5d3cef397625b1348d,25/10/2023,VM,0,NA,1,NA,dr,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,1,NA,NA,NA,336
