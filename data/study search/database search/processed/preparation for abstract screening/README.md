# Preparing data for title and abstract screening

Here we outline the steps which were conducted on the data from the initial database search to prepare our machine-learning supported title and abstract screening process. We also store intermediate data files which were created during preparation.

1. After our initial database search, we merged the results from EconLit and Google Scholar and removed duplicates using the bibliographic software [Zotero](https://www.zotero.org/) (version: 6.0.21) and the [Zotero Duplicates Merger](https://github.com/frangoud/ZoteroDuplicatesMerger) add-on (v1.1.5) for Zotero. We took care to preserve the existing complete abstracts from EconLit when merging the duplicates. See [here](https://github.com/META-CMP/data/tree/main/data/study%20search/database%20search/processed/preparation%20for%20abstract%20screening/merging%20of%20EL%20and%20GS%20results%20and%20duplicate%20removal) for the merged and duplicate-free results in `.csv` and `.ris` format.

- Entries after merging of EconLit and Google Scholar results: 18265
- Entries after removal of duplicates: 12272

2. We then applied the script [`extracting_URLs_script.R`](https://github.com/META-CMP/data/blob/main/data/study%20search/database%20search/processed/preparation%20for%20abstract%20screening/retrieving%20missing%20or%20incomplete%20abstracts/extracting_URLs_script.R) to the merged and duplicate-free dataset to extract the URLs (or, if no URL exists, the titles) of those 5572 [entries](https://github.com/META-CMP/data/blob/main/data/study%20search/database%20search/processed/preparation%20for%20abstract%20screening/retrieving%20missing%20or%20incomplete%20abstracts/entries_without_complete_abstracts.csv) that have no abstract or only an incomplete abstract (Google Scholar only extracts abbreviated abstracts and both Google Scholar and EconLit sometimes have missing abstracts). We then manually searched for these entries and retrieved their abstracts, if available, from the internet.

# Retrieving missing abstracts when only titles are available

This section describes the steps taken to retrieve missing abstracts for the 73 Zotero entries for which only titles were available. We conducted them on February 21st and 22nd in 2023.

- Using the exact title within the Google Scholar search, we screened the first few entries. When the title of those did not match the respective title, we used paranthesis to search for the exact phrase.

- When the title of an article matched a search result, but the Google Scholar citation did not have the option to retrieve the abstract, three options were used.  
  1. First, we tapped the "All 'X' versions" button in Google Scholar to screen for the respective abstracts of the relevant paper.
  2. Second, we entered the title in a Google search to retrieve the abstracts for the relevant articles.
  3. Third, we searched for the title in econlit.
  
- Option two and three of the last point were also conducted if the title of the paper seemed to fit our research question at a very basic level and none of the previous steps was successful. 

For 24 studies, this procedure provided us with the corresponding abstracts for the respective papers. 

3. Finally, we merged

to retrieve our final dataset for title and abstract screening.
