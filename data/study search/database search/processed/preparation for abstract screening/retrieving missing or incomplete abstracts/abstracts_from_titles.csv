The well-trodden technique Vector autoregressive (VAR) has been applied on the annual time series data for the period from 1972-2007, including both fiscal and monetary sides using data on output gap, inflation, short term interest rate, and government fiscal deficit over the period. This paper makes the contribution in the literature by considering the impact of both monetary and fiscal policies together. We have found positive effect of fiscal stimulus on inflation; but that on output gap the effect is negative. Effect of interest rate on output gap and inflation has been found to be negative. For policy reaction, we have found countercyclical response of monetary policy; but that of fiscal policy is pro-cyclical. The response of interest rate to deficit financing is negative while fiscal deficit positively responds to changes in interest rate.","2014-10-01","2023-03-10 13:47:16","2023-03-10 13:47:16","","35-50","","","2","","International SAMANM Journal of Finance and Accounting 2308-2356","","","","","","","","","","","","","ResearchGate","","","","; ","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/290036656_Impact_of_Monetary_and_Fiscal_Policies_on_Pakistan%27s_Economy_using_Vector_Autoregressive_Model; https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Niaz-Ghumro/publication/290036656_Impact_of_Monetary_and_Fiscal_Policies_on_Pakistan%27s_Economy_using_Vector_Autoregressive_Model/links/56948e0708ae3ad8e33b786b/Impact-of-Monetary-and-Fiscal-Policies-on-Pakistans-Economy-using-Vector-Autoregressive-Model.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Ex-post facto research design was adopted for the study. Relevant data for the study were collected from the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) statistical bulletin. Data collected was analyzed and tested using Ordinary Least Multiple regression statistical technique. Result of the finding revealed that there exist an inverse relationship between interest rate and money demanded, there exist and inverse relationship between expected inflation rate and money demanded and there exist an inverse relation between exchange rate and money demanded in Nigeria.

It uses a novel data set from 11,894 US banks, spanning the period 1990 to 2013. Findings The empirical findings show that deviations of FOMC monetary policy decisions from a number of benchmark linear and non-linear monetary (Taylor type) rules exert a negative and statistically significant impact on banks’ profitability. Originality/value The results are expected to have substantial implications for the capacity of banking institutions to more readily interpret monetary policy information and accordingly to reshape and hedge their lending behaviour.

This paper argues that monetary policy may indeed affect the severity of risks to financial stability, but that it is possible to generalize an inflation targeting framework to take account of financial stability concerns alongside traditional stabilization objectives. The resulting framework can still be viewed as a form of flexible inflation targeting; in particular, the paper proposes a target criterion that would still imply an invariant long-run price level, despite fluctuations over time in risks to financial stability or even the occurrence of occasional financial crises.","2012-04","2023-03-10 13:47:16","2023-03-10 13:47:16","2023-02-21 15:32:56","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","National Bureau of Economic Research","","","","","https://www.nber.org/system/files/working_papers/w17967/w17967.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

I show that these monetary shocks exhibit the price puzzle: a tightening shock significantly raises the price level. To explain the puzzle, I decompose futures rate surprises to show that these surprises are not clean monetary shocks, but contaminated by (1) information shocks due to the information gap between the Fed and the market, and (2) revisions in risk premia due to the revelation of the information gap. A simple measure of the information gap as forecast differences between the Fed and the market on the current state of the economy accounts for about 20% variations in futures rate surprises. Controlling for information differences between the Fed and the market solves the price puzzle. ∗Wei Li, Erasmus University Rotterdam and Tinbergen Institute, P.O.

PEP is supposed to deliver automatic accommodation to terms-of-trade shocks, while retaining the credibility gain from a nominal anchor. This paper analyzes the PEP proposal in a dynamic general-equilibrium model and compares it with a standard Taylor rule, consumer price index (CPI)-level targeting and a nominal exchange rate peg. Judged by the degree of output stabilization, PEP performs very similar to CPI targeting for export demand as well as domestic demand shocks and underperforms in the case of shocks to the export price. The results suggest that PEP is not superior to conventional CPI targeting from a macroeconomic stabilization perspective.","2015","2023-03-10 13:47:16","2023-03-10 13:47:16","2023-02-21 15:37:52","486-501","","3","19","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Wiley Online Library","","","","; ","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/rode.12172?casa_token=OrdyYmyZwiMAAAAA%3Akq2SgCpSqkW0yLfvx-Rwb_gLGSz1wPn_olvPpfcYsvxXLahLrr9Wjt_2gG7bQfHyouVmUuRAczbGRCIP; https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdfdirect/10.1111/rode.12172","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It traces the economic and monetary performance over the years; and it highlights the challenges facing the performance of monetary policy. In particular, the study tries to assess the main features of Uganda's monetary regime, and the associated economic performance from 1962 to date (May, 2014). Over the years, Uganda has shifted from direct controls of interest rate and credit to base money targeting during the 1990s as agreed under the IMF/WB structural adjustment programes. Since June 2011, the country has moved from monetary targeting to inflation targeting lite. Better economic management, including monetary policy since the early 1990s, has led to significant economic and financial performance - manifested in the form of high growth rates, low inflation, and steadfast growth in money supply and private sector credit. However, the performance of monetary policy still faces a number of the challenges, including fiscal dominance, monetary-policy-competing objectives and shallow financial markets. In order to overcome these challenges, the study recommends that the country reduces its over-reliance on monetary policy, in order to achieve competing goals, to improve the effectiveness of monetary and fiscal policy mix, to continue to improve its analytical capacity - by further strengthening of the legal and institutional framework for economic policies.","2014-01-01","2023-03-10 13:47:16","2023-03-10 13:47:16","","18-28","","","9","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","ResearchGate","","","","","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/299409754_Monetary_policy_and_economic_growth_dynamics_in_Uganda","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

О.","Monetary Regulation in The Economic Growth of A State","Financial and credit activity problems of theory and practice","","","","","In the article it is provided a comparative analysis of monetary regulation models  and explores their impact on economic growth. The  aim  of  the  paper  is  to  study  models  of  monetary  regulation  and  their  impact  on economic growth. It has been established that monetary regulation of any country in the world should be aimed at ensuring economic growth. The authors of the article proved that monetary regulation should be considered  as  a  source  of  economic  shifts,  an  increase  in  real  wages  and  living  standards accordingly;  it  acts  as  a  measure  of  inflationary  processes’  containment,  which,  in  turn,  meets strategic objectives of monetary policy. The  study  showed  that  the  rapid  development  of  monetary  policy  and  economic  growth theories is marked by certain contradictions, uncertainty and cross flows. The evolution of theories is  represented  by  the  Keynesian  Liquidity  Preference  Theory,  Monetarism,  Neoclassical  Real business-cycle  theory,  the  Neo-Keynesian  model,  and  the  New  Consensus  Model.  Each  of  the models  has  its  own  characteristics,  based  on  the  objects  of  monetary  regulation  (money  supply, inflation, interest rates, exchange rate). Based on the analysis of the views of researchers on the impact of monetary regulation on economic  growth,  the  authors  concluded  that  concepts  are  divided  according  to  those  that characterize weak relations between these phenomena, and those that prove close correlation. It is concluded that the influence of monetary regulation on economic growth takes place when choosing the regulatory model itself and instruments for its implementation. It is proved that the model of monetary regulation should be based on developed monetary rules. The authors of the article proved that in Ukraine, in conditions of using a monetary design based on the inflation  targeting  regime and taking into account the importance of increasing the efficiency of using main instruments of monetary regulation, it is necessary, first of all, to ensure the consistency of monetary and fiscal policies. The  coordination  of  monetary  and  fiscal  policies  should  consist  in  developing  and implementing them in such a way that they do not contradict each other and together contribute to the achievement of the common goals of economic policy, such as sustainable economic growth and low unemployment in terms of long-term price and external stabilities.  It is concluded that the insufficient efficiency of the monetary transmission mechanism is reflected in the imbalance of money and foreign exchange markets, the deformation of the credit  market and the credit climate degradation, and the decrease in the influence of monetary impulses  of the central bank on both the financial system and the real sector of the economy. That is, the  main  problem  of  the  significant  influence  of  monetary  regulation  on  economic  growth  in  the country  lies  in  restoring  the  effectiveness  of  the  channels  of  the  transmission  mechanism  of monetary policy, which depends on the choice of monetary design.","2020","2023-03-10 13:47:16","2023-03-10 13:47:16","","72-82","","34","3","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Google Scholar","","","","","https://fkd.net.ua/index.php/fkd/article/download/2935/3020","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

While in d,eveloped economies, changes in monetary policy affect real economic activity in the short-run but only prices in the long-run, the question of whether these tendencies apply to developing countries remain open to debate. Literature is divided over monetary instrument to be employed in developing nations. While developed nations target interest rates as their intermediate targets, developing nations employ monetary aggregates as their intermediate targets mostly due to inefficient financial market and uncompetitive banking sector. Despite Kenya implementing monetary policy aimed at achieving stable prices and fostering economic growth, the economy has been reporting low economic growth and high rates of inflation. This inability of monetary policy to effectively maximize its objectives is as a result of the shortcomings of monetary instruments used in most developing countries including Kenya. Preceding from such a background, this study finds significance by seeking to inform policymakers which policy variable relates to output and prices; this would be instrumental in guiding the choice of monetary policy instruments applied, their overall effectiveness and thus assist the Central Bank of Kenya (CBK) in meeting its policy goals of low inflation and sustainable economic growth.

It is of great concern to policy makers that monetary policy permeates deeply into the real sector to engender economic growth. The major objective of this study is to explore the monetary policy effects on the Nigerian Stock Market over time. . The Phillip-Perron (PP) unit root test was the method used to test stationarity of the variables while the Johansen Co-integration approach was conducted to test for long run relationship between the variables used.. The study found that Monetary Policy Rate, Broad Money Supply and Per Capita Income have significant long run relationship with the development of the Nigerian Stock Market. It therefore recommends among others that the monetary authority in Nigeria (CBN) should as a matter of practice operate a long term monetary plan that allow the monetary policy rate to be consistent. The constant mop up of money after an expansionary monetary policy by the CBN should be discouraged since it create instability in the money market making other money rates to be unstable and compounds the volatility rate of the country's stock prices. Finally, the gap between the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) targeted broad money and actual broad money growth should be curtailed by reducing the frequency of its mop ups which usually send wrong signals to investors in the stock market.","","2023-03-10 13:47:16","2023-03-10 13:47:16","2023-02-22 08:13:39","","","","","","","Monetary Policy and Stock Market Development","","","","","","","en-US","","","","","","","","","","https://ibima.org/accepted-paper/monetary-policy-and-stock-market-development-the-nigeria-experience-2/","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
"6A42XEGG","journalArticle","2004","Liu, Dandan","The Effects of Monetary Policy and Macroeconomic Forecasting Using Structural Factor Analysis","","","","","","The traditional vector autoregression (VAR) method is widely used to trace out the effects of monetary policy innovations on the economy. However, this method suffers from the curse of dimensionality, so that in practice VARs are estimated on a limited number of variables, leading to a ""missing information"" problem. In this paper I use the method of structural factor analysis to evaluate the effects of monetary policy on key macroeconomic variables in a data rich environment. This methodology allows me to extract information on monetary policy and its impact on the economy from a much larger data set than the one that is possible with the traditional VAR method. I propose two structural factor models. One is the structural factor augmented vector autoregression (SFAVAR) model and the other is the structural factor vector autoregression (SFVAR) model. Compared to the traditional VAR, both models incorporate far more information from hundreds of data series, series that can be and are monitored by the central bank in setting policy. Moreover, the factors used are structurally meaningful, a feature that adds to my understanding of the ""black box"" of the monetary transmission mechanism. Both models generate reasonable qualitative impulse response functions. Using the SFVAR model, both the ""price puzzle"" and the ""liquidity puzzle"" are eliminated. Finally, I use the model to conduct a forecasting exercise. I simulate out-of-sample real time forecasting using the structural dynamic factor forecasting models. I find advantages to using the structural dynamic factor forecasting models compared to alternatives that include univariate autoregression (AR) model, the VAR model and Stock and Watson's (2002) non-structural factor models, especially when forecasting real variables.","2004-01-01","2023-03-10 13:47:16","2023-03-10 13:47:16","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","ResearchGate","","","","","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/255602038_The_Effects_of_Monetary_Policy_and_Macroeconomic_Forecasting_Using_Structural_Factor_Analysis","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We employ a Bayesian model averaging procedure on a wide range of models which differ in several dimensions to account for the uncertainty that the policymaker faces when setting the monetary policy and evaluating its effect on real economy. We find evidence of a high degree of dispersion across models in both policy rule parameters and impulse response functions. Moreover, monetary policy shocks have very similar recessionary effects on the two economies with a different role played by the participation rate in the transmission mechanism. Finally, we show that a policymaker who does not take model uncertainty into account and selects the results on the basis of a single model may come to misleading conclusions not only about the transmission mechanism, but also about the differences between the euro area and the United States, which are on average essentially small.","2009","2023-03-10 13:47:16","2023-03-10 13:47:16","2023-02-22 08:23:38","1265-1300","","7","41","","","The Effects of Monetary Policy on Unemployment Dynamics under Model Uncertainty","","","","","","","en","","","","","Wiley Online Library","","","","; ","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1538-4616.2009.00256.x?casa_token=wIYoGlu0ZfsAAAAA%3AXoUa-8cGq_jk7hPdxKlo1LZEhxGvg-dD_bTmZVRxNt7Woak1bSXmY2rcGBoj5nsmBVvH08io2Tec5-9e; https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdfdirect/10.1111/j.1538-4616.2009.00256.x","Bayesian model averaging; E52; monetary policy; E58; C11; E24; model uncertainty; Taylor rule; unemployment gap","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This causes reduced jobs opportunity in most major economic sectors and has worsened when the ringgit became unstable after the Asian financial crisis in 1997. The main purpose of this study is to analyze the integration and dynamic interaction between monetary shock and overall unemployment in Malaysia for entire period of 1980-2010. In order to achieve this objective, we apply various unit root tests, Gregory-Hansen cointegration test, VECM; and Granger causality test with considering the possibility of the structural break. The estimated results clearly show that there is a structural break in the middle of 1990s; and long run co-integration did exist between monetary shock and unemployment. This happens because of the ""turn over effect"" in Malaysian labor market, where the highly educated job seekers are competing with experienced low educated labor force. Besides that, the amount of labor employed in the agriculture and manufacturing sectors in Malaysia are also declining because of automated production line and overflow of foreign labor. Although the findings of this study clearly show a long run connection with 21% corrected each year from the long-run disequilibrium between monetary shock and unemployment; surprisingly the causality result does not indicates any causal relation between both variables indicating that unemployment is not affected by monetary shock in Malaysia.","2012-07-01","2023-03-10 13:47:17","2023-03-10 13:47:17","","247-258","","","2","","International Journal of Emerging Sciences","Monetary Shock and Unstable Unemployment in Malaysia","","","","","","","","","","","","ResearchGate","","","","","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/229072513_Monetary_Shock_and_Unstable_Unemployment_in_Malaysia_A_Dynamic_Interaction_Approach","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Using policy proxy variables, several studies were conducted to investigate the impact of macroeconomic policies on global unemployment. However, this aspect explored in previous studies is the economic aspect, while the social aspect has not been well researched. This research thus examines the effect of macroeconomic (fiscal and monetary) policies and corruption on Nigerian unemployment from a broader global social as well as economic viewpoint utilizing yearly time series data spanning 39 years (1981-2019). All of the research variables were subjected to a unit root test, which revealed that they were all stationary at first difference. The Johansen Co-integration test was used to look into the long run connection between the independent and dependent variables, while the Vector Error Correction Model was used to look into the short run dynamics. The study found a long run positive relationship between money supply, economic output and unemployment. While for interest rate, government expenditure and unemployment, a negative relationship was established. In investigating the relationship between corruption and unemployment, the study employed the correlation test which revealed a positive relationship between the variables. Based on the study findings, the study therefore suggested that government expenditure and debt should be restructured in such a way that it is channelled to productive labour-intensive sectors to absorb large number of the working population, hence, leading to a decline in the unemployment rate in the country. The study also recommended that appropriate disciplinary measures should be imposed in those who engage in corrupt practices to reduce the level of corruption in the economy and have a transmission effect of reduction in unemployment.","2021","2023-03-10 13:47:17","2023-03-10 13:47:17","2023-02-22 08:43:10","","123","","","","","","","","","","Covenant University Ota.","","en","","masters","","","eprints.covenantuniversity.edu.ng","","","","; ","http://eprints.covenantuniversity.edu.ng/15470/; http://eprints.covenantuniversity.edu.ng/15470/1/Pages%20from%20Ogunwale%20Oluwadamilola%20M.Sc%20Dissertation%20%2818PAF01894%29.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

With this assumption that the goal of central bank is to pursue target inflation rate and output gap, and subject to monetary transmission mechanism, optimal rule of monetary policy obtained for Iran economy that is a function of inflation gap, output gap and oil income growth rate. Estimation results show that money growth rate has no effect on output gap and fully reflexes in inflation expectation.

First, study of the presence of inflation persistency, and second, looking for an optimal monetary policy rule. Results show that inflation in the economy of Iran is persistent, in which, short-term and long-term effects of monetary policy should be considered. For this purpose, a loss function for the central bank with arguments of inflation, output gap and the money supply growth, subject to the demand and Phillips curves, is minimized. The importance of this issue is that by expansionary monetary policy, the economic growth in the short-term can be increased with high inflation bias. On the other hand, by contraction monetary policy, benefits gained in the form of inflation reduction at the cost of lower short-term growth. Therefore, balancing among costs and benefits of inflation targeting policy with regard to the output stability is crucial, as it is optimal for the central bank to allow for a high degree of policy gradualism or money supply smoothing.

Existing studies have not conclusively determined whether the effects of the policy are large or small, effective or ineffective. Also, the difference between policy interest rate increases and decreases has not been fully studied. Using two types of VAR models, this article shows that, as expected, the ECB's monetary policy designed to boost the economy is effective in inflation stabilization, depreciation of the euro, and production improvement. Also, the impact of policy interest rate increases on inflation rate is negative (i.e., effective). However, the results of other cases are not clear empirically. To maintain price stability is the ECB's primary objective, so it can be concluded that the ECB in general has conducted monetary policy successfully.","2014-10","2023-03-10 13:47:17","2023-03-10 13:47:17","","1-18","","5","4","","","Effects of ECB Monetary Policy","","","","","","","","","","","","EBSCOhost","","","","","https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=ecn&AN=1623895&site=ehost-live&scope=cite","Deflation E31; Inflation; Monetary Policy E52; Price Level; Central Banks and Their Policies E58; Interest Rates: Determination, Term Structure, and Effects E43","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
