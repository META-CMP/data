We find that the adverse response of daily inflation to high-frequency monetary policy shocks is short-lived, if present at all, in impulse responses from both local projections and an unobserved components model of inflation dynamics. To reconcile how one can obtain a sizable adverse response with monthly or quarterly data when only a limited adverse response exists at a higher frequency, we appeal to a simple monetary policy model and show how temporal aggregation bias can exacerbate initial impulse response functions. Because our modeling results are generic and macroeconomic indicators are published with a lag, we argue that temporal aggregation bias will be a key feature of the nascent field of high-frequency macroeconomics.","2022",2023-02-13 13:34:38,2023-02-13 13:34:38,NA,"48-p.",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"eoh","Availability Note: Information provided in collaboration with the RePEc Project: http://repec.org","EBSCOhost",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Inflation; Deflation E31; Monetary Policy E52; Price Level; Macroeconomics and Monetary Economics: General E00",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,638

We test both models by using rolling window Bayesian estimations over the last decade (2001-2013). The results of the presented dynamic analysis show that the sensitivity of output with respect to money shocks increased during the Dot-com, Intifada, and Subprime crises. The role of monetary policy increased during these crises, especially with regard to inflation, even though the effectiveness of conventional monetary policy decreased during the Subprime crisis. In addition, the non-separable model including money provides lower forecast errors than the baseline separable model without money, while the influence of money on output fluctuations can be seen as a good predictive indicator of bank and debt risks. By impacting and monitoring households' money holdings, policy makers could improve their forecasts and crisis management through models considering monetary aggregates.","2016-01",2023-02-13 13:35:43,2023-02-13 13:35:43,NA,"103-124",NA,"1","38",NA,"Journal of Policy Modeling",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"eoh",NA,"EBSCOhost",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Inflation; Deflation E31; Macroeconomics: Production E23; Monetary Policy E52; Price Level; General Aggregative Models: Keynes; Keynesian; Post-Keynesian E12; Household Saving; Personal Finance D14",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,2177

In this article we contend that the second proposition applies only to small open economies with limited gold reserves. This was not the case for the United States, the largest country in the world, holding massive gold reserves. The United States was not constrained from using expansionary policy to offset banking panics, deflation, and declining economic activity. Simulations, based on a model of a large open economy, indicate that expansionary open market operations by the Federal Reserve at two critical junctures (October 1930 to February 1931; September 1931 through January 1932) would have been successful in averting the banking panics that occurred, without endangering convertibility.

It argues that the existence of sticky prices allows current and expected future monetary shocks to affect the slope of both the nominal and the real yield curves. Changes in real money balances brought about by monetary policy cause a strong liquidity effect at the short end of the yield curve. This results in changes in real output in the short/medium term which eventually get translated into changes in prices. The empirical results show that the spread between the 10 year Treasury bond and the 180 day bank bill predict the rate of change, over the subsequent one to two years, of a number of measures of real activity. Over both longer and shorter forecast horizons the spread has little predictive power. On the inflation front, the 10 year-180 day yield spread provides significant information about changes in inflation over the medium term (that is between one year and two and three years). Yield spreads between shorter dated securities are found to contain little information concerning future changes in inflation. This supports the view that at the shorter end of the yield curve changes in nominal rates often reflect changes in real rates.","2000",2023-02-13 13:38:07,2023-02-13 13:38:07,NA,"38-38",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"eoh","Availability Note: Information provided in collaboration with the RePEc Project: http://repec.org","EBSCOhost",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5350

The first problem arises because the PBC (the Chinese central bank) applies multiple instruments and none of them alone can adequately reflect changes in its monetary policy. The second one is the classical identification problem: the causation direction of the observed interaction between central bank actions and real activity needs to be identified. The PBC's documents are used to infer the intentions behind policy movements. Three shocks are identified for the period 2000-2011 that are exogenous to real output. Estimates using these shocks and various robustness tests indicate that monetary policy has large and persistent impact on output in China.","2013-09",2023-02-13 13:36:19,2023-02-13 13:36:19,NA,"56-74",NA,NA,"26",NA,"China Economic Review",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"eoh",NA,"EBSCOhost",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Macroeconomics: Production E23; Monetary Policy E52; Macroeconomic Analyses of Economic Development O11; Fiscal and Monetary Policy in Development O23; Central Banks and Their Policies E58; Inflation P24; Money; Socialist Systems and Transitional Economies: National Income, Product, and Expenditure",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,3027

In particular, the answers to the following questions are of a critical importance for understanding the efficacy of fiscal and monetary policy interventions: 1) how much does government spending stimulate GDP? 2) how nominally rigid are prices and do these rigidities differ across sectors of the economy? In this dissertation I use state-of-the-art macroeconometric techniques to shed new light on the answers to these fundamental, but unresolved, economic questions. Firstly, I extend the Markov-switching vector autoregressive (MS-VAR) framework to allow for the estimation of models with multiple regime-switching processes governing distinct sets of model parameters. Secondly, using my extensions of the MS-VAR framework, I estimate a model to investigate the extent to which the fiscal multiplier varies over time and what factors cause the time variation. Lastly, I estimate a Dynamic Stochastic General Equilibrium (DSGE) model that has multiple production sectors to assess the extent of heterogeneity in nominal rigidities across sectors and the role these rigidities play in the transmission of monetary policy shocks to real economic variables. Throughout the dissertation I use Bayesian methods for statistical inference, which are based on the likelihood function implied by the macroeconomic model. I find that the government spending multiplier varies over time and, contrary to other recent results in the literature, it varies countercyclically. The results of the MS-VAR estimation suggests that ""expansionary"" fiscal policy may not expand GDP at the economy most badly needs an expansionary policy intervention and, furthermore, that current DSGE models may suffer from misspecification along dimensions important for evaluating the effects of fiscal policies. With regards to assessing nominal rigidities, I find that the choice of estimation method is key in evaluating the extent of nominal rigidities in multi-sector DSGE models. Likelihood-based estimation methods estimate lower values of nominal rigidities than do moment based approaches.","2013-05",2023-02-13 13:34:55,2023-02-13 13:34:55,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"University of Pennsylvania",NA,NA,NA,NA,"eoh",NA,"EBSCOhost",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Monetary Policy E52; General Aggregative Models: Neoclassical E13; Fiscal Policy E62; Model Construction and Estimation C51",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,320

The model incorporates a detailed public sector capable of intervening in the economy through several channels.

With such a policy, if the short-term interest rate is constrained at zero and the inflation rate declines below its trend, the public expects that policy will eventually engineer a period of above-trend inflation that restores the price level to its target level. Expectations of future monetary accommodation stimulate output and inflation today, mitigating the effects of the zero bound. The effectiveness of such a policy strategy depends crucially on the alignment of the public's and the central bank's expectations of future policy actions. In this paper, we consider an environment where private agents have imperfect knowledge of the economy and therefore continuously reestimate the forecasting model that they use to form expectations. We find that imperfect knowledge on the part of the public, especially regarding monetary policy, can undermine the effectiveness of price-level-targeting strategies that would work well if the public had complete knowledge. For low inflation targets, the zero lower bound can cause a dramatic deterioration in macroeconomic performance with severe recessions occurring with alarming frequency. However, effective communication of the policy strategy that reduces the public's confusion about the future course of monetary policy significantly reduces the stabilization costs associated with the zero bound. Finally, the combination of learning and the zero bound implies the need for a stronger policy response to movements in the price level than would otherwise be optimal and such a rule is effective at stabilizing both inflation and output in the presence of learning and the zero bound even with a low inflation target.","2006-09-01",2023-03-16 15:47:31,2023-03-16 15:47:31,1678460070,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"en",NA,NA,NA,NA,"Social Science Research Network",NA,"Place: Rochester, NY",NA,NA,NA,"Monetary policy; Inflation",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,10014

The method, which follows Hatzius et al.

We find that the FCI tracks successfully both worldwide and euro area specific financial events. Moreover, while the national FCIs are constructed independently, they display a similar pattern across the larger euro area economies over most of the sample period and varied more widely since the start of the sovereign debt crisis in 2010. Focusing on the euro area, we then incorporate the FCI in a VAR model comprising output, inflation, the monetary policy rate, bank loans and bank lending spreads. The credit supply shock extracted with sign restrictions is estimated to have caused around one fifth of the decline in euro area manufacturing production at the trough of the financial crisis and a rise in bank lending spreads of around 30 basis points. We also find that adding the FCI to the VAR enables an earlier detection of credit supply shocks.","2014",2023-02-13 13:37:07,2023-02-13 13:37:07,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"eoh","Availability Note: Information provided in collaboration with the RePEc Project: http://repec.org","EBSCOhost",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Financial Markets and the Macroeconomy E44; General Aggregative Models: Forecasting and Simulation: Models and Applications E17; Monetary Policy, Central Banking, and the Supply of Money and Credit: General E50",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,4071

We establish strong evidence of structural breaks, particularly along the years 2007 and 2008, suggesting the very relevant impact of the recent global crisis on CEE economies. Moreover, our results suggest that the way how countries react to world commodity price shocks is related to the underlying economic structure and the credibility of the monetary policy. We also find that some countries like Slovakia and Slovenia--already euro area members--react stronger to foreign industrial production shocks than other countries and that the responses to such shocks are strongly correlated for selected CEE countries.

They are found to have a more prominent impact on inflation expectations and exchange rates compared to the earlier UMP announcements. The impact on bank equity, however, is less significant in part due to narrowing profit margin in a low interest rate environment; and the marginal effect on sovereign spread compression has diminished. By extracting components of monetary policy shocks from the yield curve, we find that the traditional signaling channel of the monetary policy transmission continued to play an important role, but the portfolio rebalancing channel became more important in the new phase. Spillovers to non-euro area EU countries (the Czech Republic, Denmark, Poland, and Sweden) are transmitted mainly through the portfolio rebalancing channel, largely affecting sovereign yields and exchange rates.","2018",2023-02-13 13:34:55,2023-02-13 13:34:55,NA,"33-33",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"eoh","Availability Note: Information provided in collaboration with the RePEc Project: http://repec.org","EBSCOhost",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,1040

Millions lost jobs and homes. At its peak, one in ten workers who wanted a job could not find one. On an annual basis, the economy contracted by more than it had since the Great Depression. A slow and steady recovery followed the Great Recession's official end in the summer of 2009, but because it was slow and the depth of the recession so deep, it took years to reduce slack in labor markets. But because the slow-and-steady recovery lasted so long, many pre-recession peaks were exceeded, and eventually real wage growth began to accumulate for workers across the distribution. In fact, the business cycle (including recession and recovery) beginning in December 2007 was one of the better periods of real wage growth in many decades, with the bulk of that coming in the last years of the recovery. We place the Great Recession in historical context and trace the path of the recovery, studying its different phases and how different groups of workers were impacted in each phase.

It explores how some economic and credit indicators affect the level of risk in the banking sector. It combines many factors that could affect banks’ risk appetite such as macroeconomic conditions, banks’ credit size and lending growth. The authors use nonperforming loans as a proxy for banking sector risks. At first, the authors have analyzed the linear relationship between monetary policy and credit risk. As mentioned above, nonlinearity is expected in the underlying relationship, and, thus, they have investigated the nonlinear relationship to deeply analyse the relationship using the dynamic panel threshold model, as stimulated by Kremer et al. (2013). Threshold models have gained a great importance in economics and finance for modelling nonlinear behaviour. Threshold models are useful in showing the turning points in the behaviour of financial and economic indicators. This technique has been applied in this study to study the effect of monetary policy on credit risk. Design/methodology/approach This paper is divided into the following sections: Section 2 which previews the recent literature; Section 3 which includes some stylized facts about the relationship between credit risk and monetary policy; Section 4 which deals with the model and methodology; Section 5 which handles the data sources and discusses the results, and finally Section 6 which is the conclusion. The paper adopts dynamic panel threshold model of Kremer et al. (2013). Findings The results show that the relationship between monetary policy and credit risk is positive and significant to a certain threshold, 6.3. If the lending interest rate is higher than 6.3, this increases the credit risk in the banking sector, because increasing the lending interest rate imposes huge burdens on the borrowers, and, therefore, the bad loans and nonperforming loans become more likely. Thus, the MENA countries need to decrease the lending interest rate to be less than 6.3 to reduce the effect of monetary policy on credit risk. Further, these results are qualitatively robust regarding the inclusion of additional control variables, using alternative threshold variables and further endogeneity checks of the credit risk, such as Risk premium and the squared term of the lending interest rate. The results of taking the risk premium and the squared term of the lending interest rate as a threshold served the analysis and confirmed the positive relationship between monetary policy and credit risk above a certain threshold. As for the risk premium, the relationship below the threshold was negative and significant. Other related research points might be a good avenue for the future research such as applying this approach to micro data of banks from different MENA countries. Also, more sophisticated approaches like time-varying panel approach to assess the relationship over the time can be applied. Originality/value The importance of this paper lies in the fact that it does not only study the effect of time, but it also focuses on the panel data about some economic and credit indicators in the MENA region for the first time. This is because central banks in the MENA region have common characteristics and congruous level of economic growth. Therefore, to study how the monetary policy affects those countries’ credit risks in their lending policies, this requires careful analysis of how the central banks in this region might behave to control default risks.","2020-01-01",2023-03-16 15:48:43,2023-03-16 15:48:43,1678464508,"289-304",NA,"4","5",NA,NA,"The effect of monetary policy on credit risk",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Emerald Insight",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Monetary policy; Threshold",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,10505

Recent commodity prices peaked in the consequences of the financial crisis of 2007, and they have remained relatively volatile since. As they are often seen as being connected in a cause and effect relationship with inflation and real output, the driving forces behind commodity price volatility are necessary for the conduct of monetary policy.

The findings show that the volatility of agricultural commodity price index and other commodities price indices overshoot the long-run equilibrium price in response to an impulse in monetary policy.","2019",2023-03-16 15:38:11,2023-03-28 08:53:10,1678205240,"200-218",NA,"2","35",NA,NA,"Commodity price volatility and U.S. monetary policy",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"en",NA,NA,NA,NA,"Wiley Online Library",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"ARMA-EGARCH model; commodity prices; monetary policy; overshooting hypothesis; VECM approach",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,7692

Indeed, to fight high inflation central banks can increase the level of the rate of interest on money without limits. However, if they had to fight deflation they could not lower the rate of interest on money below zero.

We have also applied the unit root tests to check the stationarity of each variables. Empirical results suggest that both interest rate and credit channels have important effects. Although it is expected that the credit channel would probably be the most powerful mechanism but the statistical results show that tine interest rate is the powerful channel. Following reasons could be attributed to this. First, the Central Bank strictly controls the volume as well as the rates on credit and deposits. Second, commercial banks mainly rely on long term deposits and interbank borrowing to finance credit, and not the Central Bank's discount window. Third, the security market is not well developed, and firms heavily depend on credit from banks to fund their projects. Fourth, the fixed interest rate does not cause problems, for firms while the Central Bank's quantitative restrictions in the credit might have effects on borrowings. Fifth, the household's liquidity is supposed to have a strong impact due to large volume of consumption credit and loan. Our study also shows that in the long-run, major structural change in Omani economy might lead to changes in the transmission mechanism. Significant steps in this direction will be a floating exchange rate, less dependency on oil revenue and a developed stock market.","2003-06",2023-02-13 13:34:53,2023-02-13 13:34:53,NA,"47-72",NA,"1","1",NA,"International Journal of Applied Business and Economic Research",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"eoh",NA,"EBSCOhost",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Macroeconomics: Production E23; Monetary Policy E52; Credit; Money Multipliers E51; Money Supply; Macroeconomic Analyses of Economic Development O11; Fiscal and Monetary Policy in Development O23; Central Banks and Their Policies E58",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,983

We find that: (i) in the medium-term, all four tail risks respond significantly and contemporaneously to domestic and foreign monetary-policy announcements, except for the equity tail risk to foreign policy; (ii) all four tail risks rarely change in response to other U.S. macroeconomic news; (iii) the directional pattern of their simultaneous reactions to policy announcements is often consistent with the systematic response to new information about the economic outlook rather than with the response to an exogenous shock; (iv) the few notable instances of the latter response are always in reaction to Fed announcements; and, (v) our impulse responses demonstrate that odds of extreme inflation outcomes and extreme policy-rate outcomes are tightly linked, and that both determine tail outcomes for longer-term interest rates but not for stock prices.","2017",2023-02-13 13:37:30,2023-02-13 13:37:30,NA,"42-pages",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"eoh","Availability Note: Information provided in collaboration with the RePEc Project: http://repec.org","EBSCOhost",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Monetary Policy E52; Diffusion Processes; Dynamic Quantile Regressions; Dynamic Treatment Effect Models; Multiple or Simultaneous Equation Models: Time-Series Models; State Space Models C32; Central Banks and Their Policies E58; Asset Pricing; Bond Interest Rates G12; Trading Volume; Event Studies; Information and Market Efficiency; Insider Trading G14",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,4604

The empirical results show that before August 2000 when the Taylor rule was adopted more firmly, the monetary policy shock made considerable contributions to the fluctuations in key macroeconomic variables such as the short-term nominal interest rate, the output gap, inflation, and especially output growth. By contrast, the loose adoption of the Taylor rule in the period of post-August 2000 leads to a fact that the contributions of the monetary policy shock to the variations in such key macroeconomic variables become less substantial. Thus, one policy implication is that adopting firmly the Taylor rule could strengthen the role of the monetary policy in driving movements in the key macroeconomic variables, for instance, enhancing economic growth and stabilizing inflation.","2014",2023-02-13 13:37:32,2023-02-13 13:37:32,NA,"pages",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"eoh","Availability Note: Information provided in collaboration with the RePEc Project: http://repec.org","EBSCOhost",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Business Fluctuations; Cycles E32; General Aggregative Models: Keynes; Keynesian; Post-Keynesian E12",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,4643

The objective to be achieved was to determine if there is some effect of economic transparency on accountability, inflation average, output gap, interest and central bank credibility. Findings – The results highlighted that central banks with greater transparency contribute to decrease inflation rate and interest rate. The findings denote that an increase in the information quality (clarity) implies a significant change in the rate of readjustment of market expectations. Furthermore, central bank transparency contributes to anchor the public expectations and to affect long‐run interest rates. Research limitations/implications – Impulse‐answer research was employed to show how the central bank transparency affects the credibility of monetary authorities. Practical implications – This paper suggests that the central bank publicizes its outlook, its policy monetary decisions, its expectations and its preferences. Originality/value – The originality of the paper resides in the fact that empirical and theoretical studies were made in the single work. Also, new results were found denoting that economic transparency reduces uncertainty effect and increases the power of incentive contract made between the BC and public.","2007-01-01",2023-03-16 15:45:14,2023-03-16 15:45:14,1678378390,"497-514",NA,"6","34",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Emerald Insight",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Interest rates; Monetary policy; Inflation; Economic performance; Generation and dissemination of information",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,9523

In the presence of nominal or financial frictions, when interest rates increase, the real cost of owning a house increases, and this increase may make some people prefer to rent instead of buying. This change in consumption behavior increases the price of rents relative to other goods. Starting in 1983, homeownership costs are based on a measure of implied owner equivalent rent, which is calculated using observed house rents. This change implies that, directly and indirectly, prices in the rental market almost entirely command the shelter component of CPI, which weighs around 30% in the overall index. When we take these two pieces into account and use CPI net of shelter services as a measure of inflation, we obtain impulse responses of prices to a monetary contraction shock more in line with what is predicted by theory. In addition, our results also suggest that inflation is much less persistent than what is implied by analyses using a measure of inflation that includes shelter services. Our results pass a long list of robustness check exercises and compare well against other explanations of the price puzzle.","2016",2023-02-13 13:37:04,2023-02-13 13:37:04,NA,"27-pages",NA,"Query date: 2023-02-09 16:27:49",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"eoh","Availability Note: Information provided in collaboration with the RePEc Project: http://repec.org","EBSCOhost",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Inflation; Deflation E31; Interest Rates: Determination, Term Structure, and Effects E43; Price Level; Urban, Rural, Regional, Real Estate, and Transportation Economics: Housing Demand R21",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,4011

Many more emerging economies are planning to adopt inflation targeting in coming years. The theory and practice of monetary policy under inflation targeting have evolved hand-in­-hand, benefiting mutually. This volume presents 14 papers that add substantially to the body of theoretical findings, empirical research, and policy lessons on the conduct of monetary policy under inflation targeting. New theoretical work focuses on the optimality of inflation targeting under different fiscal policies and varying degrees of price stickiness, and considering the zero-bound problem. Other analytical research addresses improvements in central bank communication required to raise monetary policy efficiency and analyzes the optimal degree of monetary policy transparency and communication. New findings are provided on the choice between inflation and price-level targeting. This book also presents a large body of new empirical evidence on the role of the exchange rate, pre-conditions at the start of the regime, gains in macro performance and monetary policy efficiency, and anchoring of inflation expectations in inflation-targeting countries, in comparison to non-targeting countries.

Imports and inflation also rise. Estimated values of present value fiscal multipliers are 0.54, 0.29 and 0.18 after 1 year, 5 years and 10 years, respectively. These results show that although positive in the short run, yet the magnitude of the fiscal multiplier is very low in the case of Pakistan.

It has been argued that the housing market in one country is then important when its mortgage market is well developed. The countries in the euro area follow unitary monetary policy; however, their housing and mortgage markets show some heterogeneity, which may lead to different policy effects on aggregate consumption through the housing market. Design/methodology/approach The housing market can act as a channel of monetary policy shocks to household consumption through changes in house prices and residential investment – the housing market channel. The authors estimate vector autoregressive models for each country and conduct a counterfactual analysis to disentangle the housing market channel and assess its importance across the euro area member states. Findings The authors find little evidence for heterogeneity of the monetary policy transmission through house prices across the euro area countries. Housing market variations in the euro area seem to be better captured by changes in residential investment rather than by changes in house prices. As a result, the authors do not find significantly large house price channels. For some of the countries however, they observe a monetary policy channel through residential investment. The existence of a housing channel may depend on institutional features of both the labour market or with institutional factors capturing the degree of household debt as is the loan-to-value ratio. Originality/value The study contributes to the existing literature by assessing whether a unitary monetary policy has a different impact on consumption across the euro area countries through their housing and mortgage markets. The authors disentangle monetary-policy-induced effects on consumption associated with variations on the housing markets due to either house price variations or residential investment changes. The authors show that the housing market can play a role in the monetary transmission mechanism even in countries with less developed mortgage markets through variations in residential investment.","2016-01-01",2023-03-16 15:34:00,2023-03-16 15:34:00,1677110400,"76-97",NA,"1","9",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Emerald Insight",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Monetary transmission mechanism; Consumption; Counterfactual simulation; Housing markets; Mortgage markets; Residential investment",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,6666

But the proposal appears in the context of the largest advanced economies. In fact NGDP Targeting may be more appropriate for middle-sized middle-income countries. The reason is that such countries are more often subject to large supply shocks and terms of trade shocks. Such unexpected shocks can force the credibility-damaging abandonment of CPI targets or exchange rate targets that had been previously declared. But they do not require the abandonment of a nominal GDP target, which automatically divides an adverse supply shock equally between impacts on inflation and real GDP. The argument can be illustrated in a model where the ultimate objective is minimizing a quadratic loss function in output and inflation but a credible rule is needed in order to prevent an inflationary bias that arises under discretion. A NGDP rule dominates IT unless the Aggregate Supply curve is especially steep or the weight placed on price stability is especially high. Parameters estimated for the cases of India and Kazakhstan suggest that the Aggregate Supply curve is flat enough to satisfy the necessary condition. The general argument applies regardless whether the monetary authorities at a particular time seek credible disinflation, credible reflation, or simply a credible continuation of the recent path.","2014-09",2023-02-13 13:36:23,2023-02-13 13:36:23,NA,"1-14",NA,"3","14",NA,"Central Bank Review",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"eoh","Availability Note: Information provided in collaboration with the RePEc Project: http://repec.org","EBSCOhost",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Inflation; Deflation E31; Macroeconomics: Production E23; Monetary Policy E52; Price Level; Open Economy Macroeconomics F41; Macroeconomic Analyses of Economic Development O11; Fiscal and Monetary Policy in Development O23; Central Banks and Their Policies E58; Inflation P24; Money; Socialist Systems and Transitional Economies: National Income, Product, and Expenditure",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,3117

Structural panel VAR-Xs with time-varying parameters (TVPs) and time-varying volatility (TVV) are employed in the two essays in this dissertation. Both essays explore the role housing markets play in generating movements in real and financial activity in regional economies of China and the US. The essays differ by the policy interventions that are analyzed. The first essay explores the impact of macro-prudential policy interventions on seven regional economies and housing markets in China. Surprise monetary policy inventions by the Federal Reserve are evaluated in the second essay for the effects on eight regional economies and housing markets in the US. The first essay makes three contributions to the study of regional Chinese housing markets. First, I construct a new monthly sample of regional real GDPs, real loans, and real house prices for China from February 2005 to March 2013. Two pre-determined national macro-prudential policy indexes are included in the sample. Second, a structural panel VAR-X with TVPs and TVV is estimated on this sample using Bayesian methods. Third, my results show regional house prices respond more to housing demand shocks of the coastal regions than to the shocks of the interior regions. Housing demand shocks also lower real GDPs and loans across the regions of China. Regional house prices display smaller responses to regional housing demand shocks during the 2007-2009 financial crisis compared with the rest of the sample.Macro-prudential policies have a larger impact on regional Chinese house prices than on regional real GDPs and loans. Macro-prudential policies in China appear to be more effective from 2011 to 2013 than during the 2007-2009 financial crisis. The second essay employs similar econometric tools, but applies these methods to study the transmission mechanism that disturbances in the real, financial, and housing sectors have on fluctuations in eight economic regions of the US. A structural panel VAR-X with TVPs and TVV is estimated on regional real personal income, real personal consumption expenditures, real loans, and real house prices across eight regions of the US from 1998Q2 to 2019Q3. I proxy for monetary policy interventions with high-frequency changes to the three-month ahead Fed Funds future. Bayesian methods developed by Canova & Ciccarelli (2009, ""Estimating multicountry VAR models,"" International Economic Review, 50, 929-959) are employed to construct the posterior of the panel VAR-X. The posterior contains evidence that the transmission of shocks across the real activity, financial, and housing sectors differ across the US. A signal of the disparate transmission of shocks is the significant house price spillovers produced by housing demand shocks of the core regions onto the interior regions of the US. Moreover, the housing demand shocks of the New England region contribute most to movements in the house prices of the other US regions. Two sets of counterfactual analyses show the responses of regional house price growth to unanticipated monetary policy interventions differ across the sample.","2021-06",2023-02-13 13:35:45,2023-02-13 13:35:45,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"North Carolina State University",NA,NA,NA,NA,"eoh",NA,"EBSCOhost",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Macroeconomics: Production E23; Monetary Policy E52; Housing Supply and Markets R31; Economic Development: Urban, Rural, Regional, and Transportation Analysis; Housing; Infrastructure O18; Socialist Systems and Transitional Economies: Urban, Rural, and Regional Economics P25",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,2224

These illustrate that the underperformance of Europe is more evident during the second decade. Searching for causes we find that the Global Financial Crisis was an exogenous shock to the EU but its impact was large in both the U.S. and the EU. One major reason is that the U.S. responded quickly and aggressively both fiscally and via an unconventional monetary policy. The Euro area was constrained by a European Central Bank that focused on price stability, and fiscal policy was not much of an option. The second shock of the Sovereign Debt Crisis was endogenous to the Euro area and it, more than the Global Financial Crisis, revealed the original weaknesses and fragility of the European monetary union. This financial fragility quickly translated into declines in aggregate demand and economic underperformance.","2020-07",2023-02-13 13:34:17,2023-02-13 13:34:17,NA,"878-892",NA,"4","42",NA,"Journal of Policy Modeling",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"eoh",NA,"EBSCOhost",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Intergenerational Income Distribution; Unemployment; Wages; Employment; Aggregate Productivity; Aggregate Human Capital; Aggregate Labor Productivity E24; Macroeconomics: Production E23; Financial Crises G01; Macroeconomic Issues of Monetary Unions F45; International Lending and Debt Problems F34; Cross-Country Output Convergence O47; Empirical Studies of Economic Growth",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,102

In particular, we focus on their wage policies by doing a Structural Vector Autoregressive analysis and assuming that populist shocks have no long-run effects on real wages. This identification implies that populist leaders prioritize redistribution through nominal wages disregarding the evolution of productivity. The results indicate that economic populism is not as widespread as previously thought. Instead, our approach leads to more nuanced results: while we find that there is populism in Argentina, the results for Brazil, Bolivia and Ecuador show only sporadic populist events.

Chapter 1 proposes a general equilibrium model with financial intermediation and sovereign default risk to study the macroeconomic consequences of news regarding a future sovereign default. The model, estimated on Italian data, is used to measure the output losses of the 2010-2012 sovereign debt crisis, and to evaluate the effects of credit policies implemented by European authorities. Chapter 2, co-authored with Boragan Aruoba and Frank Schorfheide, proposes a new class of time series model that can be used to measure nonlinearities in the data and to evaluate the fit of Dynamic Stochastic General Equilibrium (DSGE) models solved with high order perturbation. We first characterize this class, the Quadratic Autoregressive (QAR) model. We then show how the QAR model can be used as a diagnostic tool to assess whether a DSGE model is able to replicate the nonlinear behavior of a set of U.S. aggregate time series. Chapter 3, co-authored with Nils Gornemann, studies the determinants of medium term movements in the market value of U.S. corporations. We find that secular movements in the mean and volatility of TFP growth are strongly associated with these medium term fluctuations in asset prices. These empirical findings are then interpreted within a production based asset pricing model where the mean and volatility of aggregate productivity growth varies over time. We show that the model can rationalize a sizable elasticity of asset prices to the drivers of aggregate productivity. Chapter 4, co-authored with Iourii Manovskii and Marcus Hagedorn, proposes a method to identify Harrod-neutral technology shocks in the data in presence of input heterogeneity in the aggregate production function. We prove that, in a wide class of models, Harrod-neutral technology shocks are the only one consistent with a certain form of balanced growth. We then use this property to identify Harrod-neutral shocks using a state-space model. Monte Carlo simulations show that the proposed method performs very well in small samples.","2014-05",2023-02-13 13:37:25,2023-02-13 13:37:25,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"University of Pennsylvania",NA,NA,NA,NA,"eoh",NA,"EBSCOhost",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Macroeconomics: Production E23; Monetary Policy E52; Dynamic Quantile Regressions; Dynamic Treatment Effect Models; General Aggregative Models: Neoclassical E13; Financial Markets and the Macroeconomy E44; Asset Pricing; Bond Interest Rates G12; Trading Volume; Diffusion Processes C22; Single Equation Models; Single Variables: Time-Series Models",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,4501

We find that the effectiveness of a contractionary monetary policy in controlling aggregate inflation has improved over time. This improvement in the policy's effectiveness can be attributed to better transmission through credit and asset price channels. In investigating disaggregate inflation, we find that a contractionary monetary policy is more effective in reducing inflation in the manufacturing sector than in the agricultural sector. Further, the sacrifice ratios in all manufacturing sectors have improved over time. However, the commodities prices of some sectors respond positively after a monetary contraction, which demonstrates the presence of a cost channel in the Indian economy. Our findings suggest that the monetary authority in India should have an interest rate rule that incorporates sectoral inflation and reacts to each with different intensity.","2020-11-01",2023-03-16 15:44:01,2023-03-16 15:44:01,1678314292,"109-125",NA,NA,"92",NA,"Economic Modelling",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"en",NA,NA,NA,NA,"ScienceDirect",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Monetary Policy; Transmission channel; Disaggregate inflation; Sacrifice ratio",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,9120

Because of what appears to be time-varying seasonal patterns in the data, I argue that it is of crucial importance to use the annual inflation rate rather than the quarterly inflation rate in the empirical analysis. After a monetary policy shock, the impulse response functions for output and inflation display a hump-shaped pattern with peak effects after 1.5 - 2 years. There also seems to be considerable inertia in the real exchange rate. Sensitivity analysis suggests that the shape of the obtained impulse response functions is fairly robust with respect to the number of lags in the VAR, sample size, and the formulation of the policy rule. Also, we find evidence that foreign shocks are very important for understanding Swedish business cycles. In particular, they account for a large fraction of the lower frequency movements in output and inflation, whereas domestic shocks generate most of the high frequency movements in the data.","2003",2023-03-16 15:49:41,2023-03-16 15:49:41,1678492800,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Monetary Policy Shocks and Business Cycle Fluctuations in a Small Open Economy",NA,NA,NA,NA,"Sveriges Riksbank Working Paper Series",NA,"eng",NA,"Working Paper",NA,NA,"www.econstor.eu",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"153",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,10869

To achieve this objective, the study relies on an autoregressive distributed lag (ARDL) bound testing approach and innovation accounting approach, and uses quarterly data spanning from 1991:Q1 to 2010:Q4. The study documents that Islamic financing channel for monetary transmission exists in Malaysia. Islamic financing is unequally distributed to economic sectors in response to monetary policy shock. Furthermore, the findings also reflect that Islamic banking as operating in dual banking system is not spared from the interest rate and monetary conditions of the country. This clearly shows the behavior of Islamic banking which cannot shun away from the interest rate while its operation delinks from the interest rates. In designing monetary policy, the central bank should consider Islamic financing as an alternative or complement channel for monetary transmission since this channel is just as active as conventional lending channel.","2014-01-01",2023-03-16 15:43:33,2023-03-16 15:43:33,NA,"137-166",NA,NA,"35",NA,"Journal of Economic Cooperation and Development",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"ResearchGate",NA,NA,NA,NA,"https://www.researchgate.net/profile/M-Shabri-Abd-Majid/publication/287319884_Islamic_banks_and_monetary_transmission_mechanism_in_Malaysia/links/568e814708aead3f42efde5b/Islamic-banks-and-monetary-transmission-mechanism-in-Malaysia.pdf",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,8954

Results from another three countries (Canada, Chile and the United States) corroborate the analysis using data for credit origination and borrower characteristics. The main conclusions are that (i) macroprudential policies have been quite effective in stabilising credit cycles. The propagation of the effects to credit growth is more rapid (they materialise after one quarter) for policies aimed at curbing the cycle than for policies aimed at fostering resilience (which take effect within a year); and (ii) macroprudential tools have a greater effect on credit growth when reinforced by the use of monetary policy to push in the same direction.","2017-05-01",2023-03-16 15:39:32,2023-03-16 15:39:32,1678274107,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"The Impact of Macroprudential Policies and Their Interaction with Monetary Policy",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"en",NA,NA,NA,NA,"Social Science Research Network",NA,"Place: Rochester, NY",NA,NA,NA,"meta-analysis; bank lending; credit registry data; macroprudential policies",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,8005

Motivated by evidence from psychology, unemployment is modeled as a social norm. The norm is defined here as the belief that individuals in society prioritize, or should prioritize the search for gainful employment, whereas those who do not are perceived as outside the norm and, consequently, stigmatized. Households pressure the unemployed to find jobs: the fewer unemployed workers there are, the more supporters the norm has and therefore the greater the pressure and psychological cost experienced by each jobseeker. As this psychological cost is procyclical, it hinders the wage from absorbing most of the effect of the shock. Thus, the model is able to capture the high volatility of vacancies and unemployment observed in the data, accounting for the Shimer puzzle. The paper also departs from the literature by introducing price rigidity in the labor market, inducing additional inertia and persistence in inflation and the real wage after a monetary shock. The model's responses after a monetary shock are in line with the responses obtained from a VAR on US data.","2017-02",2023-02-13 13:34:21,2023-02-13 13:34:21,NA,"96-116",NA,NA,"134",NA,"Journal of Economic Behavior and Organization",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"eoh",NA,"EBSCOhost",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Intergenerational Income Distribution; Unemployment; Wages; Employment; Inflation; Aggregate Human Capital; Aggregate Labor Productivity E24; Business Fluctuations; Cycles E32; Deflation E31; Monetary Policy E52; Price Level; General Aggregative Models: Keynes; Keynesian; Post-Keynesian E12; Wage Differentials J31; Wage Level and Structure; Nonwage Labor Costs and Benefits; Private Pensions J32; Retirement Plans",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,182

The model is calibrated to the Mexican economy and is driven by three external shocks: terms of trade, world interest rate, and import-price inflation. We show econometrically that these shocks explain at a minimum 45 percent of the observed forecasting error variance of Mexican output and the Mexican real exchange rate at 8-to 16-quarter horizons.

The welfare comparisons suggest that dollarization is the least successful of the monetary policy rules considered: agents are willing to give up between 0.1 and 0.3 percent of their nonstochastic steady-state consumption to see a policy other than dollarization implemented.","2001-05-02",2023-02-13 13:37:44,2023-02-13 13:37:44,NA,"482-509",NA,"2","33",NA,"Journal of Money, Credit, and Banking",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"eoh","Availability Note: Information provided in collaboration with the RePEc Project: http://repec.org","EBSCOhost",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"International Monetary Arrangements and Institutions F33; Open Economy Macroeconomics F41; Comparative or Joint Analysis of Fiscal and Monetary Policy; Stabilization; Treasury Policy E63; Fiscal and Monetary Policy in Development O23; Central Banks and Their Policies E58; Corporate Finance and Governance O16; Economic Development: Financial Markets; Saving and Capital Investment; International Linkages to Development; Role of International Organizations O19",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,4889

However, it appears that government intervention has not been able to cure the ills in the Nigerian economy. In order words, full potentials of labour-surplus have not been fully exploited. In view of the aforementioned, this study investigates the effect of unemployment and inflation on economic growth in Nigeria using annual time series data covering the period of 1986 to 2020. To examine the model coefficient, ordinary least square technique is employed. Findings indicate that the coefficient of unemployment has a negative and significant effect on economic growth in Nigeria; while inflation exerts a positive effect. The nature of unemployment and inflation characterizing the Nigerian economy are structural and cost-push respectively; hence the need by the government and relevant agencies to formulate policies to encourage self-employment and reduce cost of doing business so as to achieve a high, rapid and sustainable economic growth. Introduction The Nigerian economy has remained largely underdeveloped despite the huge human and natural resources. The country is richly endowed with various mineral types all over the country. Huge amount is generated annually from petroleum products. More than 40 types of solid minerals have been identified in over 500 locations in the country Musa (2010). Yet the per capita income is low, unemployment and inflation rates are high. There are many socioeconomic challenges. The economy has continued to witness economic recovery which is immediately followed by economic recession and depression. The situation in Nigeria is disturbing. The various macroeconomic policies by government have been unable to achieve sustained price stability, reduction in unemployment and sustained growth cannot be achieved. The poor state of the economy has confirmed the need to manage the economy effectively. The essence of macroeconomic management underlines the rationale for the existence of government as a vital economic agent. However, it appears that government intervention has not been able to cure the ills in the Nigerian economy. The continued economic crisis, with the associated problems of high inflationary pressure, high exchange rate, and debt overhang, adverse balance of payment and high inflation rates is difficult to explain. Against a high rate of unemployment and underemployment, a large public sector, low wages and poor working conditions has been persistent high inflation rates in Nigeria. Also, underemployment and unemployment is a prominent feature of the Nigerian economy. Consequently, the full potentials of labour-surplus economy have not been fully exploited.","2021-01-08",2023-03-16 15:42:12,2023-03-16 15:42:12,NA,"254-266",NA,NA,"21",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"ResearchGate",NA,NA,NA,NA,"https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Miftahu-2/publication/351736151_EFFECT_OF_UNEMPLOYMENT_AND_INFLATION_ON_ECONOMIC_GROWTH_IN_NIGERIA/links/60a6c5bb45851522bc0a8478/EFFECT-OF-UNEMPLOYMENT-AND-INFLATION-ON-ECONOMIC-GROWTH-IN-NIGERIA.pdf",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,8647

This method allows a housing demand shock to be identified in a six-variable VAR model by imposing sign restrictions on the impulse responses of consumer prices, residential investment, real house prices and mortgage loans, while private consumption and nominal interest rate responses are left unrestricted. The results suggest that consumption responds positively and significantly to a house price shock in Canada, France, Japan and the UK. A significant positive delayed response of nominal interest rates follows a house price shock in Germany, Japan, the UK and the US, suggesting that while central banks do not seem to respond instantly and systematically to a housing demand shock, their repercussions on the economy tend to translate into higher policy rates after a few quarters.","2012",2023-02-13 13:37:18,2023-02-13 13:37:18,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"eoh","Availability Note: Information provided in collaboration with the RePEc Project: http://repec.org","EBSCOhost",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Inflation; Business Fluctuations; Cycles E32; Deflation E31; Monetary Policy E52; Price Level; Diffusion Processes; Dynamic Quantile Regressions; Dynamic Treatment Effect Models; Multiple or Simultaneous Equation Models: Time-Series Models; State Space Models C32; Financial Markets and the Macroeconomy E44",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,4343

Using new data and theory, I demonstrate that each firm's choice of how much information to acquire to set prices determines aggregate price dynamics through the patterns of pricing at the micro level, and through the large heterogeneity in pricing policies across firms. Viewed through this lens, the behavior of prices in recent years becomes less puzzling, as firms endogenously adjust their information acquisition strategies. In support of this mechanism, I present micro evidence that firms price goods using plans that are sticky, coarse, and volatile. A theory of information-constrained price setting generates such policies endogenously, and quantitatively matches the discreteness, duration, volatility, and heterogeneity of policies in the data. Policies track the state noisily, resulting in sluggish adjustment to shocks. A higher volatility of shocks does not reduce monetary non-neutrality and generates slight inflation, while progress in the technology to acquire information results in deflation.","2015",2023-02-13 13:37:52,2023-02-13 13:37:52,NA,"71-pages",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"eoh","Availability Note: Information provided in collaboration with the RePEc Project: http://repec.org","EBSCOhost",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Prices, Business Fluctuations, and Cycles: General (includes Measurement and Data) E30; Monetary Policy, Central Banking, and the Supply of Money and Credit: General E50",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5050

Our model allows oil price changes to be transmitted through temporary demand and supply channels (affecting the output gap), as well as through persistent supply side effects (affecting trend growth). We estimate this model for Canada, the United Kingdom, and the United States over the period 1971-2008, and find that it matches the data very well in terms of first and second moments. We conclude that (i) energy prices affect the economy primarily through the supply side, whereas we do not find substantial demand-side effects; (ii) higher oil prices have temporary negative effects on both the output gap and on trend growth, which translates into a permanent reduction in the level of potential and actual output. Also, results for the United States indicate that oil supply shocks have more persistent negative effects on trend growth than oil demand shocks. These effects are statistically significant; however, our simulations also indicate that the effects are economically small.","2009",2023-02-13 13:38:09,2023-02-13 13:38:09,NA,"37-pages",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"eoh","Availability Note: Information provided in collaboration with the RePEc Project: http://repec.org","EBSCOhost",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Open Economy Macroeconomics F41; Energy and the Macroeconomy Q43",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5403

In a canonical New-Keynesian DSGE model, we carry out a positive analysis by employing Bayesian methods to estimate three main categories of monetary policy rules, namely a Taylor-type interest rate rule, a money growth rule and an expanded Taylor rule with money. Based on China's quarterly data from 1996Q2 to 2015Q4, our estimation shows that the expanded Taylor rule obtains the best empirical fit to the data. Moreover, impulse responses and forecast error variance decompositions demonstrate that monetary policy rules with or without money provide very different implications for the policy behavior. Our results ultimately suggest that money has so far been more closely targeted than nominal interest rate and still plays an important role as a monetary policy target in China. Furthermore, a conventional Taylor-type interest rate rule is not good enough yet to describe China's monetary policy behavior.","2017-07-01",2023-03-16 15:34:14,2023-03-16 15:34:14,1677158209,"166-185",NA,NA,"44",NA,"China Economic Review","On the choice of monetary policy rules for China",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"en",NA,NA,NA,NA,"ScienceDirect",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Money; Interest rate; Monetary policy rule; Bayesian methods; DSGE model",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,6746
