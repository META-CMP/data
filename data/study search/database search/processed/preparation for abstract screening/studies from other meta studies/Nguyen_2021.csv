An estimated Hierarchical Panel VAR allows us to use the data efficiently and, at the same time, exploit the heterogeneity across countries. Monetary shocks are identified through an agnostic procedure that imposes zero and sign restrictions. We find a real short run effect of monetary policy on output (with a peak around 12-15 months); a significant medium run response of prices with the absence of the so-called price puzzle and a hump-shaped response of the exchange rate, i.e. weak evidence of the so-called delayed overshooting puzzle phenomenon. Nevertheless, we find some degree of heterogeneity on the impact and propagation of monetary shocks across countries. In particular, we find stronger effects on output and prices in Brazil and Peru relative to Chile, Colombia and Mexico and a stronger reaction of the exchange rate in Brazil, Chile and Colombia relative to Mexico and Peru. Finally, we present a weighted-averaged impulse response after a monetary shock, which is representative for the region. *Note: Winning article in the 2015 Rodrigo Gómez Central Bank Award, organized by the Center for Latin American Monetary Studies (CEMLA).

In contrast to the results for the euro area the degree of liquidity of an average bank seems not to work in a way predicted by the literature. Credit channel seems to operate rather through the degree of capitalisation and bank's size. A plausible reason is the structural overliquidity of the banking sector.

A structural VAR approach is used with non-recursive contemporaneous restrictions. Several interesting results appear in the analysis. First, consistent with the predictions of a stochastic rational expectations model, a domestic monetary contraction generates a transitory fall in output and monetary aggregates. Second, there is no evidence of price and exchange rate puzzles. Third, the source of Chilean output, price level, and real exchange rate volatility is similar to that identified in industrial countries: monetary policy explains a relatively small proportion of output, price level, and exchange rate variability. Finally, foreign monetary policy innovations have very short-lived effects on domestic interest rates and have no major influence over other Chilean macroeconomic variables; while risk premium shocks influence significatively both the interest rate and the exchange rate.","2001-09","2023-03-14 16:03:59","2023-03-14 16:03:59","2023-03-14 16:03:59","","","","","","","Effects of Foreign and Domestic Monetary Policy in a Small Open Economy","","","","Working Papers Central Bank of Chile","","","en","","","","","ideas.repec.org","","Number: 108 Publisher: Central Bank of Chile","","C:\Users\Enzinger\Zotero\storage\WE5NZNWQ\Parrado - 2001 - Effects of Foreign and Domestic Monetary Policy in.pdf; C:\Users\Enzinger\Zotero\storage\E35YCTNY\108.html","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Using innovation accounting in a structural vector autoregressive model, it is established that monetary authorities in Malawi employ hybrid operating procedures and pursue both price stability and high growth and employment objectives. Two operating targets of monetary policy are identified, viz., bank rate and reserve money, and it is demonstrated that the former is a more effective measure of monetary policy than the latter. The study also illustrates that bank lending, exchange rates and aggregate money supply contain important additional information in the transmission process of monetary policy shocks in Malawi. Furthermore, it is shown that the floatation of the Malawi Kwacha in February 1994 had considerable effects on the country's monetary transmission process. In the post-1994 period, the role of exchange rates became more conspicuous than before although its impact was weakened, and the importance of aggregate money supply and bank lending in transmitting monetary policy impulses was enhanced. Overall, the monetary transmission process evolved from a weak, blurred process to a somewhat strong, less ambiguous mechanism.","2011","2023-03-14 16:04:14","2023-03-14 16:04:14","2023-03-14 16:04:14","224-250","","3","79","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Wiley Online Library","","_eprint: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/j.1813-6982.2011.01284.x","","C:\Users\Enzinger\Zotero\storage\IPNVUA5N\Ngalawa und Viegi - 2011 - Dynamic Effects of Monetary Policy Shocks in Malaw.pdf; C:\Users\Enzinger\Zotero\storage\CZRB79R2\j.1813-6982.2011.01284.html","","","E52; E58; Monetary policy; monetary transmission; structural VARs","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this paper, we carry out a controlled experiment using a structural vector autoregression (SVAR) model to trace the effects of monetary policy shocks on output and prices in Nigeria. We make the assumption that the Central Bank cannot observe unexpected changes in output and prices within the same period. This places a recursive restriction on the disturbances of the SVAR. We conduct the experiment using three alternative policy instruments i.e. broad money (M2), Minimum Rediscount Rate (MRR) and the real effective exchange rate (REER). Overall, we find evidence that monetary policy innovations carried out on the quantity-based nominal anchor (M2) has modest effects on output and prices with a very fast speed of adjustment. While, innovations on the price-based nominal anchors (MRR and REER) have neutral and fleeting effects on output.

Empirical testing demonstrates that the seven-day Repo rate has an insignificant influence on both GDP changes and on the price level changes.

The results show that all the countries share a weak domestic credit channel while they are highly heterogeneous with regards to the relative effectiveness of the interest rate and exchange rate channels. Thus, Hungary and Poland’s distinctive feature is the presence of a price puzzle effect combined with a high influence of the exchange rate which acts both as a mechanism of monetary policy transmission and as a supply and demand shock absorber. On the contrary, just like in the case of the Euro zone countries, it is the interest rate channel that has the major influence in the case of the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Slovenia and partially Romania.

However, the assumption that this theorem holds is questionable. This paper argues that there are frictions in the market which traditional models based on the Modigliani and Miller theorem fail to take into account in explaining how monetary policy and other shocks are transmitted to the economy and points to new directions. A comprehensive macroeconomic model should incorporate financial market interactions to enhance the understanding of the transmission mechanisms of monetary policy and other shocks. If market dynamics are not taken into account, macroeconomic models used by policymakers may point to wrong policy choices. Motivated by the lack of assessment of the recently launched financial reforms, deregulation, consolidations, financial innovations and joint payment systems, the paper assesses the process of monetary transmission mechanism by investigating evidence of a bank lending channel in SADC during the period 1990–2006 using data from the banking sector. Data from a panel of banks is used to identify shifts in the loan supply curve in response to changes in monetary policy using a vector autoregression (VAR) model. Although the results are mixed the paper generally reports the existence of a bank-lending channel in all SADC countries in the sample.

Among the various channels of transmission, interest rate channel, credit channel and asset prices channel are found to be important, while exchange rate channel is weak. A positive shock to policy rate leads to slowdown in credit growth with a lag of two quarters and subsequently impacts GDP growth and inflation negatively. The same monetary policy shock has a negative impact on asset prices from the third quarter onwards and, in turn, has a pronounced negative impact on GDP growth and inflation. Exchange rate channel is found to have an insignificant impact on GDP growth, but has non-negligible impact on inflation. Interest rate channel is found to account for about half of the total impact of monetary shocks on GDP growth and about one-third of the total impact on inflation, indicating that interest rate channel is the most important channel for monetary policy transmission in India.","2012-06","2023-03-14 16:14:26","2023-03-14 16:14:26","2023-03-14 16:14:26","","","","","","","Monetary Policy Transmission in India","","","","","University Library of Munich, Germany","","","","MPRA Paper","","","RePEc - Econpapers","","","","C:\Users\Enzinger\Zotero\storage\RPAQZZ2V\Khundrakpam und Jain - 2012 - Monetary Policy Transmission in India A Peep Insi.pdf; C:\Users\Enzinger\Zotero\storage\AM7632NI\Khundrakpam und Jain - 2012 - Monetary Policy Transmission in India A Peep Insi.pdf; C:\Users\Enzinger\Zotero\storage\8X6LNT2K\50903.html","","","Interest Rate Channel; Monetary Policy; Monetary Transmission; Structural VAR","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Regarding the general requirements for implementing an inflation targeting strategy it appears that Poland has made sufficient progress in reducing fiscal dominance and hardening budget constraints. The paper also finds that the exchange rate has played a dominant role as a policy instrument, with the linkages between the short-term interest rate and inflation remaining unclear. Given this uncertainty, modification of some details of the strategy - such as widening the target range or lengthening the target horizon - might be helpful.","1999","2023-03-14 16:16:20","2023-03-14 16:16:20","2023-03-14 16:16:20","","","","","","","Implementing inflation targeting regimes","","","","Kiel Working Papers","","","en","","","","","ideas.repec.org","","Number: 956 Publisher: Kiel Institute for the World Economy (IfW Kiel)","","C:\Users\Enzinger\Zotero\storage\PXB3ZMVJ\Gottschalk und Moore - 1999 - Implementing inflation targeting regimes The case.pdf; C:\Users\Enzinger\Zotero\storage\WB4XWD5D\956.html","","","inflation targeting; transmission mechanism in Poland","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Our paper addresses this highly topical issue of macro-prudential framework with the focus on effectiveness of monetary policy in affecting some financial stability indicators, in the experience of several Central and Eastern European countries during 2003M01–2012M06. Using a Structural Vector Autoregressive model and impulse response function, we analyze the impact of short-term interest rates upon industrial production, loan to deposit ratio for the banking system, stock prices and exchange rate (proxy variables for financial stability). We want to test if the interest rate is conducive to financial stability. Our empirical results show that the effectiveness of the short-term interest rate in affecting selected asset prices depends on monetary policy strategy. In the case of the Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland and Romania, the interest rate instrument used for inflation targeting is conducive to financial stability. Among countries with a fixed exchange rate regime, only in Bulgaria does transmission of the foreign interest rate impulse to domestic variables promote financial stability. Additionally, our results show that in Latvia and Lithuania adjustments to the monetary policy of the European Central Bank (ECB) are not in accordance with country-specific conditions. The paper contributes to a policy debate on the design of macro-prudential polices in the aftermath of the boom-bust cycle experienced by the Central and Eastern European countries in the second half of the last decade.","2013-03-01","2023-03-14 16:17:45","2023-03-14 16:17:45","2023-03-14 16:17:45","75-98","","1","13","","","Monetary policy and financial stability","","","","","","","","","","","","Taylor and Francis+NEJM","","Publisher: Routledge _eprint: https://doi.org/10.1080/1406099X.2013.10840527","","C:\Users\Enzinger\Zotero\storage\L3I9C9NT\Cocriş und Elena Nucu - 2013 - Monetary policy and financial stability empirical.pdf","","","C58; CEE countries; E52; financial stability; G01; monetary policy; Structural Vector Autoregressive model","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

For prices and the exchange rate, the effects are permanent; but for income the effect is transitory.","2007-06-01","2023-03-14 16:18:04","2023-03-14 16:18:04","2023-03-14 16:18:04","411-430","","2","29","","Journal of Macroeconomics","Measuring monetary policy for a small open economy","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","C:\Users\Enzinger\Zotero\storage\U5YV6XV2\Berument - 2007 - Measuring monetary policy for a small open economy.pdf","","","Interest rate spreads; Monetary Policy; Small open economy","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The results indicate that monetary tightening leads first to a fall in domestic demand, primarily investment demand financed by bank lending, which translates into a gradual reduction in price pressures that eventually reduces the overall price level with a significant lag. In addition to the traditional interest rate channel, the results point to a transmission mechanism in which banks play an important role. We have also found an active asset price channel. The exchange rate channel has been less significant by comparison.","2005","2023-03-14 16:18:32","2023-03-14 16:18:32","2023-03-14 16:18:32","1-23","","","1","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","ideas.repec.org","","Publisher: State Bank of Pakistan, Research Department","","C:\Users\Enzinger\Zotero\storage\MFKC4ISM\Agha et al. - 2005 - Transmission Mechanism of Monetary Policy in Pakis.pdf","","","Mechanism; Monetary Policy; Transmission","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It first describes the changing transmission channels over the last decade. Second, the channels are evaluated in a VAR model. The exchange rate channel plays a strong role in propagating monetary shocks to output and prices. Most other channels (bank lending, asset price) are rather weak. The interest rate channel is underdeveloped but appears to be strengthening since the introduction of the interest corridor in 2005, which bodes well for adopting inflation targeting over the medium term.","2008-09-01","2023-03-14 16:42:54","2023-03-14 16:42:54","2023-03-14 16:42:54","32-82","","3","4","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","www.degruyter.com","","Publisher: De Gruyter","","C:\Users\Enzinger\Zotero\storage\9YI5KH62\Al-Mashat und Billmeier - 2008 - The Monetary Transmission Mechanism in Egypt.pdf","","","Egypt; inflation targeting; monetary policy; monetary transmission mechanism","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
"7Z4KVJ9P","report","2005","Vonnák, Balázs","Estimating the effect of Hungarian monetary policy within a structural VAR framework","","","","","https://www.econstor.eu/handle/10419/83585","A standard approach in measuring the effect of monetary policy on output and prices is to estimate a VAR model, characterise somehow the monetary policy shock and then plot impulse responses. In this paper I attempt to do this exercise with Hungarian data. I compare two identification approaches. One of them involves the ‘sign restrictions on impulse responses’ strategy applied recently by several authors. I also propose another approach, namely, imposing restrictions on implied shock history. My argument is that in certain cases, especially in the case of the Hungarian economy, the latter identification scheme may be more credible. In order to obtain robust results I use two datasets. To tackle possible structural breaks I make alternative estimates on a shorter sample as well. The main conclusions are the followings: (1) although the two identification approaches produced very similar results, imposing restrictions on history may help to dampen counterintuitive reaction of prices; (2) after 1995 a typical unanticipated monetary policy contraction (a roughly 25 basis points rate hike) resulted in an immediate 1 per cent appreciation of the nominal exchange rate (3) followed by a 0.3% lower output and 0.1-0.15% lower consumer prices; (4) the impact on prices is slower than on output; it reaches its bottom 4-6 years after the shock, resembling the intuitive choreography of sticky-price models; (5) using additional observations prior to 1995 makes identification more difficult indicating the presence of a marked structural break.","2005","2023-03-14 16:47:22","2023-03-14 16:47:22","2023-03-14 16:47:22","","","","","","","","","","","","MNB Working Papers","","eng","http://www.econstor.eu/dspace/Nutzungsbedingungen","Working Paper","","","www.econstor.eu","","ISBN: 9789639383609","","C:\Users\Enzinger\Zotero\storage\8ID4BR6J\Vonnák - 2005 - Estimating the effect of Hungarian monetary policy.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2005/1","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
