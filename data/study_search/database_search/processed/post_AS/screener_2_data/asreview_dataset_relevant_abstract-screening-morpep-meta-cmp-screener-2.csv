The objective to be achieved was to determine if there is some effect of economic transparency on accountability, inflation average, output gap, interest and central bank credibility. Findings – The results highlighted that central banks with greater transparency contribute to decrease inflation rate and interest rate. The findings denote that an increase in the information quality (clarity) implies a significant change in the rate of readjustment of market expectations. Furthermore, central bank transparency contributes to anchor the public expectations and to affect long‐run interest rates. Research limitations/implications – Impulse‐answer research was employed to show how the central bank transparency affects the credibility of monetary authorities. Practical implications – This paper suggests that the central bank publicizes its outlook, its policy monetary decisions, its expectations and its preferences.

Since its adoption by New Zealand (1990) and Chile (1991), central banks of nearly 25 industrial and emerging economies have implemented an explicit inflation target as their nominal anchor. Many more emerging economies are planning to adopt inflation targeting in coming years. The theory and practice of monetary policy under inflation targeting have evolved hand-in­-hand, benefiting mutually. This volume presents 14 papers that add substantially to the body of theoretical findings, empirical research, and policy lessons on the conduct of monetary policy under inflation targeting. New theoretical work focuses on the optimality of inflation targeting under different fiscal policies and varying degrees of price stickiness, and considering the zero-bound problem. Other analytical research addresses improvements in central bank communication required to raise monetary policy efficiency and analyzes the optimal degree of monetary policy transparency and communication. New findings are provided on the choice between inflation and price-level targeting. This book also presents a large body of new empirical evidence on the role of the exchange rate, pre-conditions at the start of the regime, gains in macro performance and monetary policy efficiency, and anchoring of inflation expectations in inflation-targeting countries, in comparison to non-targeting countries.

Although it is expected that the credit channel would probably be the most powerful mechanism but the statistical results show that tine interest rate is the powerful channel. Following reasons could be attributed to this. First, the Central Bank strictly controls the volume as well as the rates on credit and deposits. Second, commercial banks mainly rely on long term deposits and interbank borrowing to finance credit, and not the Central Bank's discount window. Third, the security market is not well developed, and firms heavily depend on credit from banks to fund their projects. Fourth, the fixed interest rate does not cause problems, for firms while the Central Bank's quantitative restrictions in the credit might have effects on borrowings. Fifth, the household's liquidity is supposed to have a strong impact due to large volume of consumption credit and loan.

It has been argued that the housing market in one country is then important when its mortgage market is well developed. The countries in the euro area follow unitary monetary policy; however, their housing and mortgage markets show some heterogeneity, which may lead to different policy effects on aggregate consumption through the housing market. Design/methodology/approach The housing market can act as a channel of monetary policy shocks to household consumption through changes in house prices and residential investment – the housing market channel. The authors estimate vector autoregressive models for each country and conduct a counterfactual analysis to disentangle the housing market channel and assess its importance across the euro area member states. Findings The authors find little evidence for heterogeneity of the monetary policy transmission through house prices across the euro area countries. Housing market variations in the euro area seem to be better captured by changes in residential investment rather than by changes in house prices. As a result, the authors do not find significantly large house price channels. For some of the countries however, they observe a monetary policy channel through residential investment. The existence of a housing channel may depend on institutional features of both the labour market or with institutional factors capturing the degree of household debt as is the loan-to-value ratio. Originality/value The study contributes to the existing literature by assessing whether a unitary monetary policy has a different impact on consumption across the euro area countries through their housing and mortgage markets. The authors disentangle monetary-policy-induced effects on consumption associated with variations on the housing markets due to either house price variations or residential investment changes.

Structural panel VAR-Xs with time-varying parameters (TVPs) and time-varying volatility (TVV) are employed in the two essays in this dissertation. Both essays explore the role housing markets play in generating movements in real and financial activity in regional economies of China and the US. The essays differ by the policy interventions that are analyzed. The first essay explores the impact of macro-prudential policy interventions on seven regional economies and housing markets in China. Surprise monetary policy inventions by the Federal Reserve are evaluated in the second essay for the effects on eight regional economies and housing markets in the US. The first essay makes three contributions to the study of regional Chinese housing markets. First, I construct a new monthly sample of regional real GDPs, real loans, and real house prices for China from February 2005 to March 2013. Two pre-determined national macro-prudential policy indexes are included in the sample. Second, a structural panel VAR-X with TVPs and TVV is estimated on this sample using Bayesian methods. Third, my results show regional house prices respond more to housing demand shocks of the coastal regions than to the shocks of the interior regions. Housing demand shocks also lower real GDPs and loans across the regions of China. Regional house prices display smaller responses to regional housing demand shocks during the 2007-2009 financial crisis compared with the rest of the sample.Macro-prudential policies have a larger impact on regional Chinese house prices than on regional real GDPs and loans. Macro-prudential policies in China appear to be more effective from 2011 to 2013 than during the 2007-2009 financial crisis. The second essay employs similar econometric tools, but applies these methods to study the transmission mechanism that disturbances in the real, financial, and housing sectors have on fluctuations in eight economic regions of the US. A structural panel VAR-X with TVPs and TVV is estimated on regional real personal income, real personal consumption expenditures, real loans, and real house prices across eight regions of the US from 1998Q2 to 2019Q3. I proxy for monetary policy interventions with high-frequency changes to the three-month ahead Fed Funds future. Bayesian methods developed by Canova & Ciccarelli (2009, ""Estimating multicountry VAR models,"" International Economic Review, 50, 929-959) are employed to construct the posterior of the panel VAR-X. The posterior contains evidence that the transmission of shocks across the real activity, financial, and housing sectors differ across the US. A signal of the disparate transmission of shocks is the significant house price spillovers produced by housing demand shocks of the core regions onto the interior regions of the US. Moreover, the housing demand shocks of the New England region contribute most to movements in the house prices of the other US regions. Two sets of counterfactual analyses show the responses of regional house price growth to unanticipated monetary policy interventions differ across the sample.",2021-06,2023-02-13 13:35:45,2023-02-13 13:35:45,,,,,,,,,,,,,North Carolina State University,,,,,eoh,,EBSCOhost,,,,,,"Macroeconomics: Production E23; Monetary Policy E52; Housing Supply and Markets R31; Economic Development: Urban, Rural, Regional, and Transportation Analysis; Housing; Infrastructure O18; Socialist Systems and Transitional Economies: Urban, Rural, and Regional Economics P25",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2224,1,,9

In the presence of nominal or financial frictions, when interest rates increase, the real cost of owning a house increases, and this increase may make some people prefer to rent instead of buying. This change in consumption behavior increases the price of rents relative to other goods. Starting in 1983, homeownership costs are based on a measure of implied owner equivalent rent, which is calculated using observed house rents. This change implies that, directly and indirectly, prices in the rental market almost entirely command the shelter component of CPI, which weighs around 30% in the overall index. When we take these two pieces into account and use CPI net of shelter services as a measure of inflation, we obtain impulse responses of prices to a monetary contraction shock more in line with what is predicted by theory. In addition, our results also suggest that inflation is much less persistent than what is implied by analyses using a measure of inflation that includes shelter services.

The second one is the classical identification problem: the causation direction of the observed interaction between central bank actions and real activity needs to be identified. The PBC's documents are used to infer the intentions behind policy movements. Three shocks are identified for the period 2000-2011 that are exogenous to real output.

In a canonical New-Keynesian DSGE model, we carry out a positive analysis by employing Bayesian methods to estimate three main categories of monetary policy rules, namely a Taylor-type interest rate rule, a money growth rule and an expanded Taylor rule with money. Based on China's quarterly data from 1996Q2 to 2015Q4, our estimation shows that the expanded Taylor rule obtains the best empirical fit to the data. Moreover, impulse responses and forecast error variance decompositions demonstrate that monetary policy rules with or without money provide very different implications for the policy behavior.

By contrast, the loose adoption of the Taylor rule in the period of post-August 2000 leads to a fact that the contributions of the monetary policy shock to the variations in such key macroeconomic variables become less substantial. Thus, one policy implication is that adopting firmly the Taylor rule could strengthen the role of the monetary policy in driving movements in the key macroeconomic variables, for instance, enhancing economic growth and stabilizing inflation.",2014,2023-02-13 13:37:32,2023-02-13 13:37:32,,pages,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,eoh,Availability Note: Information provided in collaboration with the RePEc Project: http://repec.org,EBSCOhost,,,,,,Business Fluctuations; Cycles E32; General Aggregative Models: Keynes; Keynesian; Post-Keynesian E12,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,4643,1,,15

Because of what appears to be time-varying seasonal patterns in the data, I argue that it is of crucial importance to use the annual inflation rate rather than the quarterly inflation rate in the empirical analysis. After a monetary policy shock, the impulse response functions for output and inflation display a hump-shaped pattern with peak effects after 1.5 - 2 years. There also seems to be considerable inertia in the real exchange rate.

Also, we find evidence that foreign shocks are very important for understanding Swedish business cycles.

In particular, the answers to the following questions are of a critical importance for understanding the efficacy of fiscal and monetary policy interventions: 1) how much does government spending stimulate GDP? 2) how nominally rigid are prices and do these rigidities differ across sectors of the economy? In this dissertation I use state-of-the-art macroeconometric techniques to shed new light on the answers to these fundamental, but unresolved, economic questions. Firstly, I extend the Markov-switching vector autoregressive (MS-VAR) framework to allow for the estimation of models with multiple regime-switching processes governing distinct sets of model parameters. Secondly, using my extensions of the MS-VAR framework, I estimate a model to investigate the extent to which the fiscal multiplier varies over time and what factors cause the time variation. Lastly, I estimate a Dynamic Stochastic General Equilibrium (DSGE) model that has multiple production sectors to assess the extent of heterogeneity in nominal rigidities across sectors and the role these rigidities play in the transmission of monetary policy shocks to real economic variables. Throughout the dissertation I use Bayesian methods for statistical inference, which are based on the likelihood function implied by the macroeconomic model. I find that the government spending multiplier varies over time and, contrary to other recent results in the literature, it varies countercyclically. The results of the MS-VAR estimation suggests that ""expansionary"" fiscal policy may not expand GDP at the economy most badly needs an expansionary policy intervention and, furthermore, that current DSGE models may suffer from misspecification along dimensions important for evaluating the effects of fiscal policies. With regards to assessing nominal rigidities, I find that the choice of estimation method is key in evaluating the extent of nominal rigidities in multi-sector DSGE models. Likelihood-based estimation methods estimate lower values of nominal rigidities than do moment based approaches.",2013-05,2023-02-13 13:34:55,2023-02-13 13:34:55,,,,,,,,,,,,,University of Pennsylvania,,,,,eoh,,EBSCOhost,,,,,,Monetary Policy E52; General Aggregative Models: Neoclassical E13; Fiscal Policy E62; Model Construction and Estimation C51,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,320,1,,18

The role of monetary policy increased during these crises, especially with regard to inflation, even though the effectiveness of conventional monetary policy decreased during the Subprime crisis. In addition, the non-separable model including money provides lower forecast errors than the baseline separable model without money, while the influence of money on output fluctuations can be seen as a good predictive indicator of bank and debt risks.

Motivated by evidence from psychology, unemployment is modeled as a social norm. The norm is defined here as the belief that individuals in society prioritize, or should prioritize the search for gainful employment, whereas those who do not are perceived as outside the norm and, consequently, stigmatized. Households pressure the unemployed to find jobs: the fewer unemployed workers there are, the more supporters the norm has and therefore the greater the pressure and psychological cost experienced by each jobseeker. As this psychological cost is procyclical, it hinders the wage from absorbing most of the effect of the shock. Thus, the model is able to capture the high volatility of vacancies and unemployment observed in the data, accounting for the Shimer puzzle. The paper also departs from the literature by introducing price rigidity in the labor market, inducing additional inertia and persistence in inflation and the real wage after a monetary shock.

To this end we estimate VAR models for the period 1988-2009, to assess the differential effect - if any - of a common monetary policy shock on house prices and investment. Our VAR models also allow us to explore the macroeconomic effect of wealth shocks that originate in the housing market (housing prices). Our empirical models include key macroeconomic variables, namely personal income, prices and the federal funds rate, as well as housing market variables, e.g. real house prices, given by the FHFA house price index, and housing investment, proxied by the number of housing starts.

To achieve the dual goals of price stability and maximum sustainable employment, monetary policy makers must understand the role that housing plays in the monetary transmission mechanism if they are to set policy instruments appropriately. In this paper, I examine what we know about the role of housing in the monetary transmission mechanism and then explore the implications of this knowledge for the conduct of monetary policy. I begin with a theoretical and empirical review of the main housing-related channels of the transmission mechanism. These channels include the ways interest rates directly influence the user cost of housing capital, expectations of future house-price movements, and housing supply; and indirectly influence the real economy through standard wealth effects from house prices, balance sheet, credit-channel effects on consumer spending, and balance sheet, credit-channel effects on housing demand. I then consider the interaction of financial stability with the monetary transmission mechanism, and discuss the ways in which the housing sector might be a source of financial instability, and whether such instability could affect the ability of a central bank to stabilize the overall macroeconomy. I conclude with a discussion of two key policy issues. First, how can monetary policy makers deal with the uncertainty with regard to housing-related monetary transmission mechanisms? And second, how can monetary policy best respond to fluctuations in asset prices, especially house prices, and to possible asset-price bubbles?",2007-10,2023-03-16 15:39:49,2023-03-16 15:39:49,1678275419.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,National Bureau of Economic Research,,Publisher: National Bureau of Economic Research,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,8114,1,122,37

In the first chapter, I focus on the interplay between the housing and labor market. To do so, I construct a model of search and bargaining across two different markets: the labor market and the housing market. The model highlights that housing prices and frictions in the housing market have a profound impact on labor market activity through the desire of workers to eventually purchase a home, the ""American Dream."" The model also reveals that labor market frictions can impact housing market activity. I also perform a calibration exercise to evaluate economic activity in general equilibrium. I find that frictions in the housing market generate strong negative external effects on the labor market. More specifically, a tighter housing market is associated with higher unemployment rates and less job creation. Consequently, my findings suggest that policymakers should be very careful in implementing policies targeted towards housing -- housing markets are likely to generate significant external effects to other sectors of the economy, especially the labor market. To study the effects of monetary policy on housing market activity I develop an overlapping generations model in which housing is traded across generations of individuals. Incomplete information leads to a transactions role for money so that monetary policy can be effectively studied. Moreover, individuals face liquidity risk which interferes with their ability to accumulate housing wealth. Contrary to the existing literature, I demonstrate that it is important to disaggregate fixed investment between the residential and non-residential sectors. In particular, I find the effects of monetary policy are asymmetric across the components of the overall capital stock. I conclude this chapter with a policy experiment studying how optimal monetary policy depends on housing market fundamentals. In response to adverse supply conditions in the housing sector, monetary policy should be more aggressive in order to promote residential investment and the housing stock. However, monetary policy should be conservative in order to limit exposure to risk if fundamentals favor housing demand. The third chapter is an empirical look at the relationship between monetary policy and housing market activity. I analyze and quantify the effects of monetary policy on residential investment, housing starts, new private housing permits and new single family houses sold. To conduct the analysis I estimate a vector autoregression model (VAR) where the monetary policy shock is identified using sign restrictions. No restrictions are imposed on the variables of interest, however, in response to a monetary policy shock I impose sign restrictions on the impulse responses of price, output, reserves and the federal funds rate. I find that a contractionary monetary policy shock reduces housing market activity for up to a year after the shock. Interestingly, 2 to 3 years after the economy contracts, activity in the housing sector reverses course. The findings suggest that once the economy contracts the Federal Reserve Bank reverses course by lowering the federal funds rate, and this policy reversal stimulates housing market activity.",2014,2023-03-16 15:40:46,2023-03-16 15:40:46,1678282707.0,,,,,,,,,,,,University of Alabama Libraries,,en_US,,thesis,,,ir.ua.edu,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,8366,1,111,38

The model is extended by including the traditional Taylor rule with house prices for representing monetary policy. Our findings show that house prices in Turkey are largely explained by housing preference shocks. Besides, we find that monetary policy shock plays a small role in determining the variables of the housing market in the short-term period. However, the magnitude of the impact of housing market shocks on the rest of the economy depends on the LTV ratios. The higher the LTV ratio, the higher are the effects of the government's housing policy instrument for stabilising the housing market on real macroeconomic variables such as consumption and output in Turkey.

For this reason, it is important to examine the effects of applied policies on real economic activities and inflation. Accordingly, the 2008 global financial crisis revealed the importance of the relationship between monetary policy, house prices, and real economic activity, in other words, the channel of transmission of house prices. As a matter of fact, developments in the housing industry have a significant impact on the process leading up to the 2008 Global financial crisis. In this context, after the 2008 Global financial crisis, both the role of house prices in monetary policy implementation and the function of house prices in the transmission mechanism has begun to be questioned. In this study, the effectiveness of the house prices transmission channel, a subgroup of the asset prices channel based on the experience of the 2008 Global financial crisis, was empirically analyzed based on the Turkish economy. The VAR model has been preferred as a method of empirical analysis. The analysis covers the period 2010-2019, and the monthly data set is used in the analysis. The results of the analysis show that monetary policy affects house prices, but house prices do not have a statistically significant effect on housing investment, industrial production index, and inflation.

But we also find evidence that real estate prices have a large impact on these key macroeconomic variables. We find out that the house price shock is a germane aggregate demand shock because it raises output and prices and leads to increasing money market rates in all countries. The story behind this finding is that increasing house prices lead to an increase in households' net worth which leads to increasing consumption expentitures and thereby stimulates aggregate demand. This stimulus on aggregate demand leads to increasing output and inflationary pressures on which the central bank reacts by tightening monetary policy. We find out that 12 to 20 percent of output fluctuations and around 10 to 20 percent of price fluctuations can be traced back to the housing demand shock.

This paper considers the relative importance of two of these hypotheses.  First, global imbalances increased liquidity in the US financial system, driving down long-term real interest rates.  Second, the Federal Reserve kept interest rates low in the first half of the 2000s.  Both factors reduced the cost of borrowing and may have encouraged the boom in house prices.  This paper develops an empirical framework to separate the relative contributions of these two factors to the US housing market.  The results suggest that capital inflows to the United States played a bigger role in generating the increase in house prices than monetary policy loosening.  Using VAR methods, we find that compared to monetary policy, the effect of a capital inflows shock on US house prices and residential investment is about twice as large and substantially more persistent.  Results from variance decompositions suggest that, at a forecast horizon of 20 quarters, capital flows shocks explain 15% of the variation in real house prices, while monetary policy shocks explain only 5%.  In a simple counterfactual exercise, we find that if the ratio of the current account deficit to GDP had remained constant since the end of 1998, real house prices by the end of 2007 would have been 13% lower.

I do so by providing empirical evidence and by employing structural models calibrated to household balance sheets data. In the first chapter, I show that monetary policy has heterogeneous effects across euro area countries. I provide evidence of strong correlations between cross-country monetary policy potency and housing and mortgage market institutions, namely the share of adjustable-rate mortgages and the homeownership rate. This study highlights that the housing and mortgage markets play an important role in determining the potency of monetary policy across countries in the eurozone. In the second chapter, I incorporate the share of adjustable-rate mortgages and the homeownership rate into a quantitative currency-union New Keynesian model which I calibrate to Spain and to the euro area. My results reveal that a higher adjustable-rate mortgage share and a higher homeownership rate interact to amplify the effects of monetary policy on economic activity due to smaller mortgage interest payments and a higher fraction of mortgaged homeowners operating in the market. I use the model to show that a euro-area-wide mortgage market requiring shared financial regulation decreases the heterogeneous effects of monetary policy by weakening the pass-through to average mortgage interest rates. The last chapter shows that house price changes are strongly correlated in the data following monetary policy shocks. I build a New Keynesian model of the housing market where households choose the optimal amount of housing and mortgages. To accommodate realistic house price movements, I extend the housing market structure to include search frictions and house price rigidity so that the housing market clears through the relative fraction of successful buyers and sellers each period. I show that the house price momentum does not translate into slow movements of output and therefore it cannot explain the high degree of persistence found in the data following a contractionary monetary shock. I also highlight important redistributional effects between savers and borrowers in the economy. In particular, house price momentum coupled with the loan-to-value constraint forces the indebted households to cut their consumption for several quarters following a contractionary monetary shock.",2022-05,2023-02-13 13:34:35,2023-02-13 13:34:35,,,,,,,,,,,,,Boston University,,,,,eoh,,EBSCOhost,,,,,,Business Fluctuations; Cycles E32; Monetary Policy E52; General Aggregative Models: Keynes; Keynesian; Modern Monetary Theory E12; Post-Keynesian; Macroeconomics: Consumption; Saving; Wealth E21; Banks; Depository Institutions; Micro Finance Institutions; Mortgages G21; Housing Supply and Markets R31,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,548,1,222,64

The first say, ""The Effects of Monetary Policy on Housing Using State Level Data,"" investigates how individual states respond to national policy actions. State level analysis can provide policy makers with additional information to use when making national forecasts. Results from impulse response functions indicate a wide range of possibilities from the states, in response to an exogenous monetary policy shock. The second paper, ""The Effects of Adjustable Rate Mortgages on House Price Inflation,"" deals with house prices and the mortgage market. At the peak of the housing boom, adjustable rate mortgages represented more than two thirds of the subprime market and more than 20% of the overall mortgage market. The focus of this paper is therefore to study what determines adjustable rate mortgages and to address the possibility of a feedback effect between house prices and adjustable rate mortgages. The results are consistent with earlier finding on the importance of the spread between fixed rate and adjustable rate mortgages as the key determinant of the share of adjustable rate mortgages in the mortgage market. The assertion of the potential for a simultaneous relationship between house prices and adjustable rate mortgages is a plausible one. The third essay ""Structural times series models of regional income and house prices,"" studies regional house prices, and regional income and the relationships between them. The use of unobserved components model gives us the tools to study unobserved factors affecting the relationship between house prices and income that is not often considered in traditional regressions.

Our results suggest that both types of shocks have a significant and positive effect on real house prices, real credit to the private sector and real residential investment.  The responses of housing variables to both types of shocks are stronger in countries with more developed mortgage markets, roughly doubling the responses to a monetary policy shock.

We find that real house prices are pro-cyclical - co-moving with real GDP, consumption, investment, CPI inflation, budget and current account balances, and output gaps. House price booms are typically preceded by a period of easing monetary policy, but then diminishing slack and rising inflation lead monetary authorities to begin tightening policy before house prices peak. In a careful reading of official reports, speeches, and minutes, we find little evidence that foreign central banks have reacted to past episodes of rising real house prices beyond taking into account their implications for inflation and output growth. However, central bankers have expressed a range of opinions in the more recent policy debate with some willing in certain cases to raise policy rates to try to stem current and future surges in asset prices while others favor moral suasion or a hands-off approach. Finally, we characterize the risks associated with house-price reversals. Although mortgage lenders in some countries have significant exposure to house prices, the balance of evidence suggests that this exposure does not, in and of itself, pose a significant risk to financial stability. Nevertheless, the co-movement of both property prices and default rates with the business cycle means that losses on mortgage lending are likely to be higher when banks' other lines of business are also performing poorly.",2005-09-01,2023-03-16 15:48:59,2023-03-16 15:48:59,1678472736.0,,,,,,,Monetary Policy and House Prices,,,,,,,en,,,,,Social Science Research Network,,"Place: Rochester, NY",,,,business cycles; financial stability; asset prices; bubbles,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,10590,1,222,69

For instance, housing prices in the United States, Spain, and Ireland have been marked by one of the most striking boom-bust cycles in their history. The concomitant increase in housing prices (and in some cases boom-bust episodes) across many advanced economies raises the following important questions. Was there a housing bubble across advanced countries? What are the main determinants of the housing price movements in these countries? Are the advanced countries' housing markets interrelated? The three essays in this dissertation analyze two main topics on macroeconomic price adjustments. The first two essays attempt to answer the questions raised above by studying the latest evolution in housing market prices in the United States and eight other advanced economies (six Western European countries, Australia, and New Zealand). The third essay analyzes the price evolution of the war bonds issued by the United States in order to finance the World War I. The first chapter of the dissertation estimates a set of structural Bayesian VAR models for the U.S., France, Spain, and Greece that examine the relative effects of developments in the real production sector, the financial sector, and international capital flows on the housing market. A second exercise attempts to identify the presence of housing price bubble regimes by estimating a set of two state Markov-switching Bayesian VAR models. The main results for the U.S. show that foreign capital inflows, measured by the current account balance as a percentage of GDP, account for more than 30% of the variance of the shocks hitting housing prices, while adjustable mortgage rates contribute about 38%. In France, monetary policy has the largest explanatory power for the housing market evolutions, while in Spain and Greece, the variable mortgage rates and housing investments exert the largest influence on the housing market. All the countries experienced a bubble regime over most of the 2000s. The second chapter uses a Global VAR model estimated using quarterly data from seven countries, for the period 1987-2011, to analyze the interdependencies that exist between domestic and international factors in housing markets. We find that housing price shocks originating in the U.S. have large spillover effects on all the countries, with the largest magnitudes on Ireland. This result suggests that housing markets may be subject to contagion effects and that housing can be analyzed as a speculative asset, based on international data spanning the past two decades. Linkages in long-run real interest rates are positive and statistically significant across all the countries, although they have a limited role on the evolution of housing prices. Negative shocks to the U.S. housing prices have negative and statistically significant effects on real GDP in the U.S., Canada, and Ireland. The third chapter studies the price fluctuations of war bonds issued by the U.S Treasury in order to finance the World War I between November, 1917 and December, 1920. Bayesian time series techniques are used to carry out the analyses. We are focusing on the effects that the bond purchasing program of the War Finance Corporation (WFC) had on the evolution of war bond yields. Our main results show that positive shocks to WFC purchases display a negative and statistically significant effect on all types of war bond yields. Furthermore, WFC purchases of Liberty and Victory Bonds, except the First Liberty Loan, had a statistically significant effect on the evolution of commercial paper rates. WFC purchases of the Second and Fourth Liberty Bonds had significant and positive effects on commercial paper rates, suggesting a twist in the bond yield curve.",2012-08,2023-02-13 13:37:34,2023-02-13 13:37:34,,,,,,,,,,,,,University of Delaware,,,,,eoh,,EBSCOhost,,,,,,Monetary Policy E52; Current Account Adjustment; Short-term Capital Movements F32; Banks; Depository Institutions; Micro Finance Institutions; Mortgages G21; Asset Pricing; Bond Interest Rates G12; Trading Volume; Canada: 1913- N22; Economic History: Financial Markets and Institutions: U.S.; Housing Supply and Markets R31,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,4673,1,222,74

Using a reduced form model, he shows that the economic situation would have been improved if a more responsive monetary policy had been implemented. In this paper, we set up a two-sector New Keynesian DSGE model, estimated using Bayesian techniques, to evaluate Taylor's hypotheses. We assume a less responsive Taylor rule for the period of study, which allows us to separate the effects of the responsiveness of monetary policy and the effects of monetary shocks caused by other reasons. Our results contradict Taylor's hypothesis, that a less responsible monetary policy aggravated the housing boom. Instead, we find that monetary policy played a minor role. We do find, however, that a more responsive monetary policy may have stabilized housing prices during the transition period of 2004-2008, the period of the boom to the bust. Moreover, a more responsive monetary policy would have generated smaller responses of the real variables to shocks, except for the technology shock in the housing sector. One of the differences with the literature is that we introduce housing market segmentation through different discount factors, leading to a housing market that is occupied only by constrained (impatient) households. The impulse responses to monetary policy shocks and cost push shocks under this assumption deliver unconventional results. In particular, a contractionary monetary policy shock and a positive cost push shock will bring down the interest rate and inflation respectively. Moreover, the real housing price is reduced with these two shocks, leading to more binding constraints for the impatient households. To clear the housing market, the interest rate is reduced, automatically taxing patient lenders and subsidizing impatient borrowers. The theoretical variance decomposition indicates that the monetary shock explains about 21% of the variances in housing prices and the cost push shock explains about 63%, while the variance in the housing output is mainly explained by the technology shock in housing sector. Our conclusion is that monetary policy shocks, rather than the responsiveness of monetary policy, contributed to the housing boom, but with limited effect.",2014-08,2023-02-13 13:34:53,2023-02-13 13:34:53,,,,,,,,,,,,,"SUNY, Stony Brook",,,,,eoh,,EBSCOhost,,,,,,Monetary Policy E52; General Aggregative Models: Keynes; Keynesian; Post-Keynesian E12; Housing Supply and Markets R31,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,979,1,111,76

It consists of two essays. The first essay examines the role the housing market has in the US business cycle. The second essay explores more the relationship between the housing market and the mortgage market with a special focus on the 2007-2009 financial crisis. The first essay studies the role of housing in the US economy since 1971. The focus is on the impact of the housing and mortgage markets on the business cycle and monetary transmission mechanisms. A ten variable TVP-SV-SVAR is used to address several issues. I study the effect of housing demand and supply shocks on the US business cycle and mortgage rates. Additionally, the impact of mortgage credit shocks on the US business cycle and the housing market is examined. Finally, I discuss the interactions between the US housing market and Fed monetary policy. The evidence shows: (i) housing demand shocks play only a small role in the US business cycle and in determining mortgage rates; (ii) housing supply shocks are more relevant to the 2007-2009 financial crisis than housing demand shocks; (iii) mortgage credit supply shocks have considerable effects on housing supply and inflation; (iv) monetary policy has a substantial effect on the US housing market since 1971. In the second essay, I estimate a SVAR with housing and mortgage markets to study the 2007-2009 financial crisis along three dimensions. First, the essay examines the links between the composition of mortgage-backed securities (MBS) and the US housing market in the run-up to the financial crisis. Second, the role liquidity shocks and GSEs played in triggering the financial crisis is explored. Third, I evaluate the effectiveness of the quantitative easing (QE) programs in reducing the mortgage spread. Five main findings emerge from the estimations. First, a shock to the private-label share of MBS generates an increase in house prices, especially in 2004-2006. Second, housing demand shocks raise private MBS issues relative to securities issued by the GSEs. This response is particularly strong from 2003 to 2006. Third, liquidity shocks are the most important driver of the commercial paper spread during the 2007-2009 financial crisis. Fourth, the GSEs role in the collapse of the MBS market is limited. Finally, the effect of QE programs on the mortgage spread is minimal.",2020-10,2023-02-13 13:36:16,2023-02-13 13:36:16,,,,,,,,,,,,,North Carolina State University,,,,,eoh,,EBSCOhost,,,,,,"Business Fluctuations; Cycles E32; Monetary Policy E52; Financial Crises G01; Housing Supply and Markets R31; Urban, Rural, Regional, Real Estate, and Transportation Economics: Housing Demand R21",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2956,1,222,78

We identify shocks to two observable variables – the central bank's interest rate and the exchange rate. We find that most prices decline in response to an increase in the interest rate, so there is no ""price puzzle"". A shock to the interest rate has, at least for some time, an effect on relative prices due to a distinct effect on partial price aggregates of the CPI. Generally, price aggregates that are better correlated with macro factors, or that are characterized by serial correlation in the specific shocks tend to react more to a monetary shock.

First, monetary policy induced-movements in house prices translate into consumption changes because of wealth eﬀects. Second, a contractionary monetary shock raises the cost of borrowing which reduces the demand and as a result the liquidity of the housing market, further depressing house prices and further increases the cost of borrowing. Furthermore, nominal long-term mortgage debt implies that changes in monetary policy result in redistribution between lenders and borrowers and generate cash-ﬂow eﬀects that are larger for borrowing constrained households. We build a heterogenous agent New Keynesian model with a frictional housing market to quantify the various mechanisms. The model is able to match the rich empirical heterogeneity in home ownership, leverage and MPC across households. In particular, our model is consistent with the signiﬁcant difference in MPC between low- and high-LTV households that we document in the data. Our quantitative ﬁndings are as follows: First, we ﬁnd that about 20% of the drop in aggregate consumption against a contractionary monetary shock is due to declining house prices. Second, we ﬁnd asymmetric responses of the economy to shocks, with contractionary shocks yielding a larger response of all variables.

These changes in the aggregate impact of monetary policy can be explained by several important changes in the monetary transmission mechanism and in the composition of macroeconomic and credit aggregates.

Thus, we estimated a Bayesian VAR model based on an asset-pricing framework allowing for rational bubbles in the United States, the United Kingdom, and Canada. In addition, this estimation framework separates the fundamental component of housing prices from its bubble component, derived as the deviation of observed prices from the fundamental values. This allowed us to examine the responses of both components to a monetary policy shock and assess how bubbles may affect the responses of housing prices to monetary policy tightening.

Monetary policy is non-neutral, for it moves the real rate, thus alters agents' intertemporal consumption decisions. The standard model is a simplified world without information frictions or regional heterogeneity. In a world with information frictions, monetary policy actions communicate to the public about the central bank's private information. Monetary policy can generate additional effects by shaping agents' beliefs about the true state of the economy or the future monetary policy path. In a world with regional heterogeneity, monetary policy can have interesting interactions with local characteristics. This dissertation investigates regime-dependent, state-dependent, and heterogeneous regional effects of monetary policy. Chapter 1 introduces a new regime dependence of monetary policy due to information frictions: the effects of monetary policy shocks depend on the type of the fundamental macro shock in the economy. Specifically, output responses to monetary policy shocks are amplified relative to their counterparts in perfect information models when the fundamental macro shock is a productivity level shock or a demand shock. In contrast, output responses are dampened when the fundamental macro shock is a productivity growth rate shock. Households observe the overall fundamental in the economy but cannot distinguish its persistent part from its temporary part. The central bank sets the interest rate tracking a function of the persistent fundamental plus a monetary policy shock, so the interest rate is a noisy signal about the persistent fundamental with the monetary policy shock as the noise. Exogenous monetary policy shocks lead households to update their perceptions about the persistent fundamental differently facing varying types of fundamental macro shocks, thus generating heterogeneous effects on output. Chapter 2 introduces the position effect: the effects of a monetary policy shock depend on its relative position in the monetary policy sequence. I use both event study and local projections methods to investigate how the effects of monetary policy depend on the relative position of monetary policy shocks in monetary policy sequences. The effects of monetary policy are less potent in the first half of monetary policy sequences, which I phrase as the position effect. Possible explanations include different implicit forward guidance, different information effects, and Fed's different interest rate smoothing behavior at different positions in the monetary policy sequence. I provide supporting evidence for the interest rate smoothing behavior: less interest rate smoothing in the first half of a monetary policy sequence shortens the shock duration, thus weakening the effect. Chapter 3, joint work with Ninghui Li, investigates the regional heterogeneity of monetary policy on local house prices. House prices in growing urban areas are more sensitive to monetary policy. We first define urban growth and urban decline using CBSA level population data and then test local house prices to monetary policy shocks using local projections. The housing supply elasticity does not drive our results, although it plays a role in house price dynamics. We find evidence supporting that the effect of monetary policy interacts with the long-run expectations driven by local population growth.",2021-06,2023-02-13 13:34:38,2023-02-13 13:34:38,,,,,,,,,,,,,"University of California, Davis",,,,,eoh,,EBSCOhost,,,,,,"Monetary Policy E52; General Aggregative Models: Keynes; Keynesian; Modern Monetary Theory E12; Post-Keynesian; Neighborhood Characteristics R23; Population; Regional Labor Markets; Urban, Rural, Regional, Real Estate, and Transportation Economics: Regional Migration; Macroeconomics: Consumption; Saving; Wealth E21; Central Banks and Their Policies E58; Housing Supply and Markets R31",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,639,1,111,98

The model has four intermediate sectors: non-traded, housing, traded, and resources. Households are assumed to consume housing services as part of their consumption bundle and gain utility from holding housing stock. The utility specification increases households' willingness to hold housing stock and implies a relatively high sensitivity of housing investment to monetary policy. We estimate the model on Australian data and find that our model is better able to match a number of empirical regularities compared to a model without housing. These regularities include the sensitivity of housing investment to interest rates and the persistence of aggregate output's response to monetary policy shocks. We then use the model to explore the role of the housing sector in the rebalancing of the Australian economy following the end of the mining boom. First, we find that most of the recent increase in housing investment has been an endogenous response to the large fall in commodity prices and associated declines in interest rates. Second, the pick-up in housing investment has significantly supported the economy over the past five years, adding a 1/2 percentage point to GDP growth and a 1/4 percentage point to inflation, in year-ended terms.",2018,2023-02-13 13:34:48,2023-02-13 13:34:48,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,eoh,Availability Note: Information provided in collaboration with the RePEc Project: http://repec.org,EBSCOhost,,,,,,Business Fluctuations; Cycles E32; Macroeconomics: Production E23; Housing Supply and Markets R31,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,859,1,221,99

With this in mind, this paper investigates the relationship between monetary policy and housing market activity using a relatively new method for identifying monetary shocks. More specifically, a monetary policy shock is identified by explicitly imposing sign restrictions on impulse response vectors. The extra information from sign restrictions is important for new insights regarding the transmission of monetary policy to the housing sector – notably, the results indicate that residential investment is less sensitive to a contractionary shock than standard estimates with recursive restrictions. Given that the response of the housing sector using sign restrictions is smaller than other work using standard identification methods, the work indicates that further research is needed to examine whether other sectors of the economy may be less sensitive to monetary policy than previously thought.",2018-01-01,2023-03-16 15:46:01,2023-03-16 15:46:01,1678446155.0,23-31,,,68,,Economic Modelling,The impact of monetary policy on housing market activity,,,,,,,en,,,,,ScienceDirect,,,,,,Monetary policy; Sign restrictions; Housing activity,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,9800,1,222,101

The regional asymmetry in the efficacy of monetary policy could be caused by several sources, like industry composition, housing supply elasticities, and credit condition.

This combination of results suggests that monetary policy may affect housing tenure decisions (own versus rent).

We find that measures of inflation that exclude shelter have most of the statistical properties of the widely used measures of inflation, such as the CPI and the price index for personal consumption expenditures, but have higher standard deviations and react more to monetary policy shocks.

That should not be surprising: Although low interest rates raise house prices, the increase in prices during the mid-2000s was much larger than the historical relationship between the two variables would suggest. Instead, we investigate further the link between the marked loosening in terms and standards for mortgage credit and the most rapid increases in house prices.

It plays a crucial, perhaps even central, role in the study of monetary economics. However, few studies have focussed on developing small, open economies, and even fewer have covered characteristics such as the aggregate demand components, the low independence of monetary policy, the weak developing financial markets and structural changes in the economy. Few quantitative empirical studies have been conducted on the monetary transmission mechanism in Vietnam, and they do not include a non-recursive structural vector autoregression model with structural breaks, and characteristics of a small, open economy. This study attempts to fill such research gaps. The aim of this thesis is examining the role of monetary policy in the Vietnamese economy, in terms of shocks to the economy via different channels, and the international dimension of the monetary transmission mechanism in the small, open economy of Vietnam. To answer these questions, the study uses quarterly data for the period 2000:1 to 2011:4 and the Structural Vector Autoregression (SVAR) approach. The SVAR is more suited than the Vector Autoregression (VAR) approach to examining structural shocks as a test of multivariate models. The findings show that the statistically significant break dates are found in this study, so a dummy variable is included in the SVAR model of Vietnam. The study’s findings reveal that the impacts of a monetary contraction on domestic variables are largely consistent with theories, except for its impact on price level. A monetary contraction causes the output to decrease, but weak. The monetary channels explain about 20 percent of fluctuations in real output. The higher output causes the domestic price to increase. A money shock is not a main reason in increasing the domestic price because of its small and statistically insignificant effects. Vietnam’s current price-controlling regimes are effective in ensuring price stability in spite of shocks in world oil and rice prices. The outcomes of this research illustrate that the interest rate channel is the most effective channel for transmission to the price fluctuations and the exchange rate for output variations. The study found the stock price channel as the least effective, which is consistent with the modest role of the stock market in the Vietnamese economy. This limits the statistically significant contemporaneous effects of monetary policy (the interest rate and credit) on stock prices. The monetary aggregate could not be a reliable tool to contemporaneously transmit monetary policy signals to the financial market. In addition, the study finds that domestic shocks have a more significant impact on the Vietnamese economy than foreign shocks do. Policymakers need to focus on solving the internal problems of the economy. However, they should keep a keen eye on some foreign factors in the short run because of significant effects of foreign output on domestic output, of foreign output on the monetary aggregate, of world gold price on the monetary aggregate, and of world rice price on the domestic price. In the analysis of aggregate demand components, significant contemporaneous relationships (the domestic price-exports, the domestic output-imports, and exports-stock prices) are evident. These relationships suggest policymakers’ cautious consideration on the trade-off between economic growth and price stability. Imports and exports are quickly affected by a monetary contraction; however, negative impacts on import demand contribute to improvements in Vietnam’s trade balance in the short run. The credit channel plays an important role in trade activities. The role of the exchange rate channel is less for prices, imports, and exports. Finally, the results illustrate that the effects of a monetary contraction on private investment and private consumption are consistent with economic theory and expectation, but these responses occur in a short time. The influence of monetary transmission channels on private consumption is higher than that on private investment. In this study, there is no evidence of the output and forward discount puzzles. The puzzles of price, liquidity and exchange rate are addressed but they are transitory, occurring in the short run and disappearing over time. Based on the major findings, this study suggests some policy recommendations: (i) there is a need to focus on solving the internal problems of the Vietnamese economy to create a strong motivation for the development of Vietnam; (ii) monitoring the important transmission channels, including the interest rate, exchange rate and credit channels in formulating monetary policy; coordinating monetary policy with other policies to effectively control inflation in Vietnam.",2014-01-01,2023-03-28 10:48:44,2023-03-28 11:05:32,,,,,,,,"Monetary transmission mechanism analysis in a small, open economy",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,https://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/4286/,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,11216,1,221,115

These two findings taken together support the view that stock market prices may be important for monetary policy, independently of their direct impact on inflation.

It aims at achieving six objectives. First, it investigates not only the channels associated with monetary-policy-induced changes in the financial markets but also those associated with the monetary-policy-induced changes in the goods market. Second, it assesses and compares the relative strength of each channel of monetary policy transmission, which has not been attempted previously in the case of the Indonesia. This attempt is made possible by the use of a single model to investigate the multiple channels of monetary policy transmission. Third, it examines whether the 1998 financial crisis has changed the course of each channel of monetary policy transmission. Specifically, whether the role played by each channel in the monetary policy transmission weakened or strengthened is investigated. Fourth, to achieve these objectives a structural vector autoregressive (SVAR) model of the Indonesian economy is constructed. However, before these objectives are addressed the issue of whether the monetary policy shocks have plausible macroeconomic effects is dealt with. To that end, a nonrecursive identifying strategy is applied. Likewise, the complexity of the actual monetary policy conduct in Indonesia that makes it hard to single out the monetary policy instruments actually in use in Indonesia is mitigated by devising eight SVAR specifications. Fifth, it addresses the issue of non-stationary data in VAR modelling by conducting unit root test that allows for one and two endogenouslydetermined breaks. Specifically, this study examines the robustness of the Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) unit root test to the presence of one and/or more structural breaks. Given the fact that most time series data have structural breaks, such an attempt has not been done in the case of Indonesia. Finally, it attempts to solve the identification problem associated with bank lending channel using cointegration procedures based on the autoregressive distributive lag (ARDL) model and the impulse response function analysis that have not been applied to an Indonesian case. (One advantage of the ARDL approach is that it is appropriate irrespective of whether the time series data used are integrated of degree one or zero). SVAR model specification that captures the most plausible effects of monetary policy shocks is selected out of eight specifications of the SVAR model of the Indonesian economy estimated using both monthly and quarterly data from 1984M12- 2003M12 (1984Q4-2003Q4). The eight different SVAR models are estimated out of the fact that in reality there are four potential measures of monetary aggregates: total reserves, base money, narrow money (M1) and broad money (M2) and two potential measures of short-term interest rates: interbank call-money rate (R1) and SBI rate (interest rate on Bank Indonesia bills) (R2) as monetary policy instruments. Based on the estimated impulse response analyses, the specification that best captures the effects of monetary policy shocks, as expected by theory, is selected. Overall, the monthly eight-variable SVAR specification that uses M2 as measure of monetary aggregate and R1 as short-term interest rate is superior to the other specifications. However, the quarterly version of the same specification is superior to all other specifications because it resolves the exchange rate puzzle (the initial depreciation of exchange rate following a monetary tightening). This model specification is used to empirically assess the relative strength of channels associated with the monetary-policyinduced changes in the financial and goods markets. In regards to the latter, it has shown empirically, relying on the concept of contribution derived from estimated SVAR models, that consumption spending plays a predominant role in the monetary transmission mechanisms. This result is more in line with the findings regarding the United States than with those regarding the Europe and Japan. For the latter countries investment spending is predominant in the monetary transmission mechanisms. As for the channels associated with the monetary-policy-induced changes in the financial markets, this study finds that bank loans are dominant. The accumulated response of output attributed to this channel is stronger than the exchange rate and asset price channels. A monetary tightening shock leads to a fall in bank credit, with a lag of about three quarters. However, the importance of bank loans has been exaggerated by the credit crunch during the financial crisis period. The role of bank loans is weaker during the period before the financial crisis, although stronger than the other two channels. The finding on the bank lending channel suffers an identification problem: do the monetary-policy-induced movements in bank loans originate from the supply or demand side? The “credit view” of monetary policy transmission requires that the former is the case. The estimation of error correction models where the cointegating vectors allow for one structural break and are based on the Johansen’s and Autoregressive Distributive Lag (ARDL) procedures find that the former is the case. Further, the impulse response analysis based on both vector error correction (VEC) models of the bank loans market and the eight-variable SVAR corroborates this result irrespective of the origin of shock, monetary policy or otherwise. Likewise, the first requirement of the credit view that a monetary tightening by the central bank is capable of constraining the supply of bank loans is satisfied. Similarly, this analysis also satisfies the second requirement of the credit view that the monetary-induced decline in the supply of bank loans depresses aggregate spending due to the significance of the bank-dependent borrowers. Thus, the bank lending channel is confirmed. The exchange rate channel is found to be the weakest. The reason is that during and after the financial crisis there are anomalies associated with this channel. The exchange rate channel operates against the conventional wisdom. A monetary tightening shock is accompanied by exchange rate depreciation and subsequently weakening the level of economic activity. These anomalies disappear when the estimation covers observations before the financial crisis only. These anomalies are due to the fact that during the crisis period the exchange rate depreciation was so enormous that monetary policy tightening had little or no effect in arresting the depreciation pressure. Further, since Indonesia is a highly indebted economy the enormous exchange rate depreciation has inflated the foreign-currency-denominated debts and hence greatly worsened firms’ balance sheets, thereby depressing firms’ investment and productive capacity and hence the level of economic activity. As for the asset price channel, the results reveal that the equity price channel is also weaker than the bank loans channel but slightly stronger than the exchange rate channel. Due to the collapse of stock market and sharp decrease in the use of equity financing during the financial crisis period, the equity price channel of monetary policy transmission had weakened during that period. Further, to the extent that this channel follows Monetarist view or Tobin’s view, the latter seems to play a dominant role. That is, the real effect of this channel is mainly due to investment spending increases spurred by higher Tobin’s q resulting from the increase in stock price following a monetary easing. Finally, this study also confirms the occurrence of credit crunch following the financial crisis.",2005-01-01,2023-03-16 15:32:48,2023-03-16 15:32:48,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,6407,1,112,120

It is important to study the influence channel of monetary policies on the real economy. Based on the structural VAR model, this study uses the monthly data from the Chinese financial sector and actual macroeconomic variables from January 2001 to December 2020 to analyze the influence channel of monetary policy and its impact on the real economy in order to find out about the effectiveness of monetary policy. Focusing on before and after the global financial crisis, this study elaborates on the transmission effects of monetary policy before and after the global financial crisis. The results are as follows. In terms of the impact of rising interest rates, before and after the global financial crisis, industrial production continued to be negatively affected for a long time and consumer prices continued to increase during this period leading to price difficulties. In addition, the money supply and the RMB exchange rate decreased. Due to the shock of rising interest rates, stock indexes have fallen as predicted according to the economic theories. Moreover, because of the shock of rising interest rate, higher money supply, industrial production situation was unexpected before and after the global financial crisis, which led to a positive effect on consumer prices in the short-term. The change of RMB exchange rate was not obvious statistically, but there was a negative effect. During this period, stock indexes was the opposite of expectation. The impact of some macroeconomic variables on monetary policy can be seen as different from predictions based on economic theories and it doesn’t have much statistical significance, indicating the lack of effectiveness and transmission effect of monetary policy. The influence channel and effects of monetary policies are similar to the black box. Inevitably there will be changes in the financial markets and the real economy according to the specific conditions. It also means the influence channel and effects of monetary policy don’t play a vital role. It takes a long time for monetary policies to affect the real economy. Therefore, to maximize the effect of monetary policies, it is essential to determine the current economic situation and implement the policies. Furthermore, it is vital to actively improve the financial market system.

I show that these frictions amplify the response of residential construction to all economic shocks, making them central to producing the large observed historical volatility in residential construction. Further, monetary policy is transmitted to the housing market through the interest rate spread between mortgages and risk free bonds. An expansionary monetary policy shock reduces this spread, which incentivizes households on the margin between wanting to rent and wanting to own to begin searching for a house to buy and spurring new housing construction. To test the qualitative predictions of monetary policy shocks in the DSGE model, I estimate a factor-augmented vector autoregression and identify the structural monetary policy shocks with an external instrument. Consistent with the transmission mechanism in the DSGE model, an expansionary monetary policy shock reduces the interest rate spread between mortgages and Treasury bonds. Further, the identified impulse response functions of housing market variables are all consistent with the DSGE model. Chapter 2: Forecasting Residential Investment in the United States This chapter studies time series models for forecasting residential investment. It includes standard univariate and multivariate models, and proposes an error correction model (ECM) based on the stock-flow relationship of housing starts, completions and units under construction. All models are estimated on real-time data, and the root mean squared prediction errors (RMSPEs) of the models are compared along with the RMSPEs of the Survey of Professional Forecasters (SPF) and the Federal Reserve's Greenbook. For the 1981:Q3 to 2013:Q2 sample, the ECM improves upon the competing time series models and it makes modest improvements to the SPF. For the 1981:Q3 to 2007:Q4 sample, the ECM performs comparably to the Greenbook. Relative to the current state of professional forecasting, the ECM performs best at multi-step forecast horizons and in volatile economic periods. Chapter 3: Has the Impact of the Federal Funds Rate Increased? Two stylized facts of the Unites States economy are that nominal prices in the services sector change less frequently than those in the goods sector and that the size of the services sector relative to the goods sector has increased over the last 50 years. In a two-sector new Keynesian model, these facts imply that interest rate shocks should have a larger impact on output in more recent time periods. In contrast to this implication, impulse response functions of U.S. GDP to Federal Funds rate shocks estimated using both vector autoregressions and factor-augmented vector autoregressions are larger in the 1959 to 1979 time period than in the 1983 to 2007 time period. A possible explanation for this empirical result is that interest rate policy became aggressive against inflation in recent time periods. Via calibration, I show that the effects of this policy shift swamp the effects of changes to nominal stickiness and relative sector size.",2015-08,2023-02-13 13:34:48,2023-02-13 13:34:48,,,,,,,,,,,,,University of Wisconsin,,,,,eoh,,EBSCOhost,,,,,,Monetary Policy E52; General Aggregative Models: Neoclassical E13; Model Construction and Estimation C51; Housing Supply and Markets R31,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,265,1,111,129

It makes use of both theoretical and empirical methods. Motivated by structural changes in the financial sector and the central bank's policy conduct in the last decades, this dissertation reappraises monetary policy's impact on the real economy. While the first two chapters focus on conventional monetary policy using the short-term interest rate as the primary policy tool, the third chapter shifts towards unconventional monetary policy using the central bank's balance sheet. Such policies came to prominence when the policy rate reached the effective lower bound during the 2007-2009 global financial crisis. The first chapter analyzes the implications of the recent rise in bank concentration for the effectiveness of monetary policy. I study how the structure of the banking system affects the transmission of monetary policy for stabilization and the credit cycle. First, I use branch-level data on deposit and loan rates to evaluate how monetary policy pass-through depends on the level of local bank competition and bank capitalization. I show that banks operating in high-concentration markets, as well as under-capitalized banks, adjust short-term lending rates more in response to changes in the policy rate, especially when the policy rate moves upwards. Second, I build a theoretical model with heterogeneous banks that rationalizes the empirical findings and explains the underlying mechanism. In the model, monopolistic competition in local deposit and loan markets, along with bank capital requirements, impose frictions on the pass-through to the real economy. Counterfactual analyses highlight that the recent rise in bank concentration strengthened the pass-through by two channels, which I label the market power and capital allocation channel. Finally, I demonstrate that both channels strengthen monetary policy transmission to output and investment, amplify the credit cycle, and lead to a flattening of the Phillips curve. The second chapter, written in conjunction with Rudiger Bachmann and Eric Sims, focuses on identifying monetary policy shocks. We propose a new approach to estimate monetary policy shocks that exploits exogenous variation in the central bank's policy rate. In particular, we use the nowcast errors of the central bank with respect to the output gap and inflation as instrumental variables to isolate exogenous variation in the policy rate. We then compute the effects of the shock on the real economy using local projection methods. The results indicate that a contractionary monetary policy shock has a limited effect on output but a persistent effect on prices. In contrast to alternative identification approaches, there is no price puzzle when analyzing the period from 1987 to 2008. Further, we validate the identification approach in an augmented New Keynesian model assuming that the central bank observes current output and inflation with nowcast errors. The third chapter, co-authored with Ronald Mau and Jonathan Rawls, turns to unconventional monetary policy and studies the interaction between the central bank's main policy tools--the interest rate and balance sheet. First, we derive the welfare loss function in a simple New Keynesian model with a role for the central bank's balance sheet. We show that in this model, term premium volatility enters the welfare loss function along with the standard inflation and output gap volatility terms. We then study optimal monetary policy for three cases using a single or dual policy tools, (i) the interest rate as the primary tool, (ii) the interest rate and the balance sheet together, and (iii) the balance sheet is the only tool. We reach several conclusions. First, we find that with optimal policy rate behavior under discretion, an exogenous balance sheet expansion is deflationary and lowers the implied path of the short-term policy rate. At the effective lower bound (ELB), optimal policy lengthens the ELB event duration following an exogenous balance sheet expansion. This serves as a potential theoretical rationalization for the so-called ""signaling channel"" of central bank asset purchases. Second, with endogenous balance sheet policy in addition to the policy rate, the central bank can simultaneously stabilize inflation, the output gap, and the term premium. Finally, we show that endogenous balance sheet policy rules exist that support a permanent policy rate peg.",2021-05,2023-02-13 13:34:35,2023-02-13 13:34:35,,,,,,,,,,,,,University of Notre Dame,,,,,eoh,,EBSCOhost,,,,,,Inflation; Deflation E31; Monetary Policy E52; Price Level; General Aggregative Models: Keynes; Keynesian; Modern Monetary Theory E12; Post-Keynesian; Financial Crises G01; Central Banks and Their Policies E58; Banks; Depository Institutions; Micro Finance Institutions; Mortgages G21,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,545,1,111,131

The objective is to compare how monetary policy changes are transmitted to output in these economies. The analysis is based on evidence prior to the establishment of the common monetary policy within Economic and Monetary Union (EMU). A number of international studies over the last five years, in particular by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the Bank of International Settlements (BIS), have analysed how the effects of monetary policy can vary between countries. These studies have analysed most EU countries but Ireland has generally been omitted. This is due in part to the lack of the necessary quarterly national accounts' data for output but also to the small weighting of Irish output in the euro area. This paper re-addresses the omission of Ireland by using a constructed quarterly GDP data series from 1972 to 1998. The paper, in line with previous international studies, applies a common methodology based on time series relationships and economic theory that incorporates three variables--prices, output and interest rates. This common methodology is applied to thirteen EU countries. In order to compare the responses similar data series, sample periods and an identical econometric framework are used for all countries. The transmission mechanism is the process through which monetary policy decisions are transmitted into changes in output. Economic theory tends to draw a distinction between the short and medium term when distinguishing the effects of monetary policy on the real economy. Over the medium term inflation is primarily a monetary phenomenon and in terms of the real effects on output, money is considered to be neutral. In the short term, however, monetary policy is considered to have real effects. There are two important dimensions to the conduct of monetary policy to be clearly distinguished. The first is the adjustment of monetary policy instruments in reaction to changes in objective variables such as output and inflation. The second is the impact of monetary authorities' actions on the real economy. The paper concentrates on the latter. The monetary transmission mechanism consists of several inter-linked channels, such as the interest rate or money channel, the credit channel, the exchange rate channel and the asset price channel, which can differ substantially across countries. The focus of this paper is on the aggregate effect of these different transmission channels rather than on the relative importance of each in the different EU countries. The motivation for this focus arises from the need for the real effects of monetary policy to be relatively uniform across the different EU countries in order to facilitate the smooth conduct of monetary policy in the euro-area. It is also motivated by the lack of consensus on the effects of monetary policy changes through different channels in different countries or even within a given country. The lack of consensus stems from the difficulty in disentangling time series on interest rates into parts that are due to deliberate monetary policy measures and those that are due to endogenous responses of financial markets to unobserved economic disturbances. As a result, different empirical methodologies give rise to different estimates of the role and effect of monetary policy. The results from the common specification used by the international agencies would suggest that a monetary shock resulting in higher interest rates would seem to have an implausibly large and persistent impact on output in the Irish case in comparison to other EU countries. This may point to the need for a unique econometric specification for each economy in order to capture the differences in the monetary transmission mechanism more accurately rather than something unique about the Irish economy. The consequence of this recommendation would diminish the comparability of the results, but to proceed otherwise would be ill advised. Using a modified framework shows that the effects on output from interest rate changes in the smaller, peripheral countries in the EU, such as Ireland, Portugal, Finland and Denmark are deeper than those in the larger countries. While the magnitude of effects may be similar in these groups, the duration over which they occur can differ markedly. Therefore no consistent, common grouping emerges in terms of impact and duration. There is no evidence on the basis of this paper that there is a core group of countries, with the exclusion of Ireland, forming an obvious optimum currency area with the EU.",2000,2023-02-13 13:37:43,2023-02-13 13:37:43,,32-pages,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,eoh,Availability Note: Information provided in collaboration with the RePEc Project: http://repec.org,EBSCOhost,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,4865,1,111,135

We find that the calibrated model provides an explanation to the ""price puzzle"" and delivers two important results with policy implications. First, the homeownership decision channel amplifies the redistributive effects of monetary policy, with contractionary shocks benefiting more outright homeowners and disadvantaging more renters and homeowners with a mortgage.

Emerging market economies are structurally different from advanced economies as they are generally associated with greater financial frictions, underdeveloped financial markets, as well as both a high average level and unequal access to dollarized assets, among others. Thus, the study on the impact of monetary policy in emerging economies requires additional specifications. The first essay investigates the distributional consequences of monetary policy in the context of a small open economy framework. I show that wealthy households (represented by the top ten percent of the income distribution), who are more able to save in foreign currencies, gain in purchasing power of their incomes by hedging against domestic inflation. At the same time, since the poor (represented by the bottom fifty percent of the income distribution) retain larger share of liquid assets denominated in domestic currency, consequently leading them to bear a greater burden of local currency inflation. I also show that contractionary monetary policy is associated with periods of higher income inequality in emerging markets. The second essay presents a comprehensive practical analysis of Kazakhstani city-level housing prices. The key focus is to test whether there is a single, integrated Kazakhstani housing market, and hence to examine potential long-run relationships among the seven city housing prices series for which we have monthly data during the period 2014-2017. We also explore how monetary policy shifts and subsequent exchange rate shocks could affect the system of relative prices. The results obtained suggest that city-level house prices are weakly related across cities in the long run, and the interest rate channel of monetary policy currently is surprisingly weak in Kazakhstan. The third essay discusses a relatively new take on Inflation Targeting as a single-mandate monetary policy, which effectively exposes its many disadvantages. Our discussion first introduces the issues of coordination and conflict between fiscal and monetary policies. Our empirical exercise directly addresses the unemployment outcome of inflation targeting policy compared to other monetary policy settings. Our results show that while IT actually reduced the average inflation rate prior 2008 financial crisis, it has a negative effect on the unemployment rate in the longer term. The paper argues that the aggregate unemployment rate is an optimal social welfare-maximizing goal for central banks and should be used as a natural second target in a typical emerging market economy case.",2019-09,2023-02-13 13:36:00,2023-02-13 13:36:00,,,,,,,,,,,,,University of Massachusetts,,,,,eoh,,EBSCOhost,,,,,,"Monetary Policy E52; Personal Income, Wealth, and Their Distributions D31; Fiscal Policy E62; Macroeconomic Analyses of Economic Development O11; Fiscal and Monetary Policy in Development O23; Housing Supply and Markets R31",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2572,1,221,137

We provide evidence of considerable heterogeneity in sectoral price responses by introducing time variation in a factor augmented vector autoregression model. Over time the majority of individual prices respond negatively after a contractionary monetary policy shock and the price dispersion diminishes.

The various relationships between monetary policy and asset prices in the U.S. economy are investigated through steady state Bayesian VAR (SS BVAR) and revised Taylor-rule (Forward-looking rule) based on the Generalized Method of Moments (GMM). The multi-step ahead forecasts using steady state Bayesian VAR (SS BVAR), standard BVAR, and conventional VAR are executed. Equal predictive ability tests following Giacomini and White (2006) verify that the SS BVAR is superior in forecasting performance especially in the long-horizons when compared to the cases of standard BVAR and conventional VAR. Alternative identifications involving the housing sector are explored in two different ways: an economic theory-based approach and algorithms of inductive causations. The impulse response of housing price and investment to Federal Funds Rates (FFRs) in all alternative identifications illustrate that the magnitudes are relatively smaller, less significant, and shorter when compared to the Choleski case. Also, this finding can be fortified by historical decomposition and conditional forecast analyses which confirm that the recent high peak in housing prices cannot be well accounted for except by the housing price shock itself. With all these estimation results, it is hard to agree with the argument that the considerable responsibility of the current housing boom and fallout is due to monetary policy shocks. Rather, it can be said that there is still enormous uncertainty between monetary policy and housing prices. Institutional shocks such as fundamental change of mortgage markets including the mobilizing the mortgage debts could probably compose the ""uncertainty"". How does the Fed respond to stock price and inflation movements differently across high and low inflation sub-periods? The replicated linear estimation results of Dupor and Conley (2004)'s indicate that the Fed raises its target interest rate responding to stock price gap with statistical significance. The linear estimation results, however, are not statistically robust to small changes in the breakpoint especially in the inflation coefficient. Thus, a nonlinear model is constructed as an alternative way to relax this problem. Upon the nonlinear framework, the identification of the dominant cause of apparent change in the Fed behavior, between structural change and nonlinearity, is explored. Consequently, both nonlinearity and structural changes matter in an explanation of the Fed's behavior. Given a structural change, the inflation coefficients' movements show that the Fed has responded nonlinearly to the expected inflation pressure across the high and low inflation sub-periods, while the stock price gap coefficients' show an explicit break around the early 1990s in line with Dupor and Conley (2004)'s finding.",2008-12,2023-02-13 13:34:57,2023-02-13 13:34:57,,,,,,,,,,,,,Texas A&M University,,,,,eoh,,EBSCOhost,,,,,,Monetary Policy E52; Financial Markets and the Macroeconomy E44; Central Banks and Their Policies E58; Asset Pricing; Bond Interest Rates G12; Trading Volume,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1060,1,112,139

Design/methodology/approach--Johansen's (1995) cointegration technique and error correction models are used to explore the long-run relationship among variables. To investigate how macroeconomic aggregates respond to a one-standard deviation shock to the underlying monetary measures, the authors estimate impulse response functions based on error correction models. The study uses quarterly data covering the period 1980-2009. Findings--The results provide evidence that there is a long-run stable relationship between the authors' monetary measures and the underlying macroeconomic aggregates. They also find that the industrial production adjusts at a faster speed relative to commodity prices and the exchange rate over the examined period. Further, they show that the short-term interest rate has relatively stronger effects on output as compared to broad money supply, whereas prices and exchange rates adjust more quickly to their long-run equilibrium when money supply is used as a measure of monetary policy. Finally, the authors find significant evidence of a price puzzle regardless of whether they consider a closed or an open economy case. However, an initial appreciation of exchange rate is observed in response to a one-standard deviation shock to money supply, indicating the overshooting hypothesis phenomenon. Practical implications--The findings of the analysis suggest that the interest rate-oriented monetary policy is more effective when the monetary authorities' objective is to enhance the output growth of the economy. However, in case of inflation targeting, the broad money supply seems a more appropriate instrument. Our findings also suggest that the monetary policy has a significant role in stabilizing both real and nominal sectors of the economy. Originality/value--The main value of this paper is to examine the significance of monetary policy for a developing and relatively small open economy, namely, Pakistan. The authors use the error correction model, which improves the estimation by accounting for the long-run association. They also take into account the world oil prices by including the world commodity price index as a control variable in their empirical investigation.

This is as true in India as it is elsewhere. While its floating exchange rate gives the RBI monetary autonomy, the country’s limited degree of integration with world financial markets and RBI’s interventions in the foreign exchange markets limit the strength of the exchange rate channel of monetary transmission. The country lacks large and liquid secondary markets for debt instruments, as well as a well-functioning stock market. This means that monetary policy effects on aggregate demand would tend to operate primarily through the bank lending channel. Yet the formal banking sector is small, and does not intermediate for a large share of the economy. Moreover, there is evidence that not only are the costs of financial intermediation high but also that the banking system may not be very competitive. The presence of all these factors should tend to weaken the process of monetary transmission in India. This paper examines what the empirical evidence has to say about the strength of monetary transmission in India, using the structural vector autoregression (SVAR) methods that have been applied broadly to investigate this issue in many countries, including high-, middle-, and low-income ones. We estimate a monthly VAR with data from April 2001 to December 2014. Applying a variety of methods to identify exogenous movements in the policy rate in the data, we find consistently that positive shocks to the policy rate result in statistically significant effects (at least at confidence levels typically used in such applications) on the bank lending rate in the direction predicted by theory. Specifically, a tightening of monetary policy is associated with an increase in bank lending rates, consistent with evidence for the first stage of transmission in the bank lending channel. While pass-through from the policy rate to bank lending rates is in the right (theoretically expected) direction, the pass-through is incomplete. When the monetary policy variable is ordered first, effects on the real effective exchange rate are also in the theoretically expected direction on impact, but are extremely weak and not statistically significant, even at the 90 % confidence level, for any of the four monetary policy variants that we investigate. Finally, we are unable to uncover evidence for any effect of monetary policy shocks on aggregate demand, as recorded either in the industrial production (IIP) gap or the inflation rate. None of these effects are estimated with strong precision, which may reflect either instability in monetary transmission or the limitations of the empirical methodology. Overall, the empirical tests yield a mixed message on the effectiveness of monetary policy in India, but perhaps one that is more favorable than is typical of many countries at similar income levels.",2016,2023-03-16 15:43:48,2023-03-16 15:43:48,1678312185.0,59-110,,,,,,Monetary Transmission in Developing Countries,,,,,Springer India,New Delhi,en,,,,,Springer Link,,,,,,Monetary Policy; Exchange Rate; Exchange Rate Regime; Aggregate Demand; Financial Integration,,"Ghate, Chetan; Kletzer, Kenneth M.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,9070,1,111,147

The globalisation of economy created more complexities in conduct of monetary policy with exposure to exogenous factors like oil price shock and federal fund rate. The Reserve Bank of India also made several changes in the base rate system in order to improve monetary transmission mechanism. A structural vector autoregressive model has been proposed and monthly data has been incorporated after post-liberalisation period April 1996-March 2017. Contractionary monetary policy has had adverse impact on output growth for a long run and increases the price level for short term in contrast to its decline and rises the issue of 'price puzzle'. The depreciation of exchange rate also encourages exporters to increase industrial production in turn raises the average price level due to increase in import cost. Exogenous factors like oil price shocks have negative impact on domestic output growth and raise inflation for long time horizon. This also propels to decrease stock prices marginally and also in turn effect exchange rate adversely. Increase in the US federal fund rate have detrimental effect on output growth for a year and has an immediate sharp impact on call money rate.

Thereafter, these became considerably low and more stable. This latter development has been named the ""great moderation"" with first observation in the US and comparable evidence for other developed and developing economies including South Africa. However, the 2007/2009 economic and financial crisis resulted into heightened uncertainty and volatility. This brings to question the role of monetary policy and its effectiveness in the economy. This paper examines the transmission mechanism of shocks to monetary policy in South Africa using quarterly data from 1980:1 to 2012:4. We also in addition identify demand and supply shocks. Our analyses are based on a factor-augmented vector autoregression with time-varying coefficients and stochastic volatility (TVP-FAVAR), which allows us to simultaneously analyze the changing impulse responses of a set of 177 macroeconomic variables covering the inflation, real activity, asset prices and monetary series. We also have intangible variables, such as confidence indices, and survey variables. These data capture the broad trends in the South African economy. Our results based on the impulse response functions, are consistent with economic theory as we observe no price puzzle that is often associated with the standard VAR models. We find evidence of modest time variation in the transmission of shocks. Overall, the macroeconomic variables seemed to have responded slightly more to the monetary policy shocks in the post-2000 (inflation targeting) sub-period than the pre-2000 period, albeit the differences in the effects are statistically insignificant. The forecast error variance decomposition results show the changes in the macroeconomic variables are largely determined by the demand shock relative to the monetary policy shock although the contribution of the latter increased slightly over time. Our results suggest the need for a more efficient role of the monetary authority as this will both improve its credibility and greater economic stability. As inflation still remains within the upper portion of the 3-6% target range, appropriate mix of supply and demand side policies could be explored alongside monetary policy to reduce inflationary pressures.",2020,2023-02-13 13:34:33,2023-02-13 13:34:33,,55-73,,4,54,,Journal of Developing Areas,,,,,,,,,,,eoh,,EBSCOhost,,,,,,Inflation; Deflation E31; Macroeconomics: Production E23; Monetary Policy E52; Price Level; Financial Markets and the Macroeconomy E44; Macroeconomic Analyses of Economic Development O11; Fiscal and Monetary Policy in Development O23,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,494,1,221,163

The model specification and the estimation results give rise to a nominal transmission channel and a real activity transmission channel of the monetary policy to prices. Unlike large and relatively closed economies in which monetary policy affects prices through its effect on economic activity, in the case of Israel, the evolution of prices is affected first, through the nominal exchange rate channel, and only at a later stage is their effect felt on economic activity.

The analysis of impulse functions of interest rate shocks, corporate lending, volume of money supply, growth of prices and the exchange rate was carried out. An interpretation of the transmission channels of the Russian economy was given. The following channels were considered: interest rate, bank lending, cash flows, unforeseen prices and the exchange rate channel. All channels under consideration are statistically confirmed, but they exist with varying degrees of effectiveness. The existence of weak channels of monetary transmission is associated with the depressive state of the economy, lack of its growth in recent years, and high inflation, as well as with the policy of shift from the ruble rate targeting to the inflation targeting policy. The outcomes of use of the standard VAR methods for the developing Russian economy can be used as a guideline for further theoretical and empirical analysis of the transmission mechanism",2016-04-01,2023-03-16 15:47:21,2023-03-16 15:47:21,1678449721.0,273-282,,2,6,,IJEFI,,,,,,,,"scheme=""ISO639-1""",,,,,dergipark.org.tr,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,10001,1,112,167

It consists of three chapters. Chapter 1 explores the dynamics of monetary transmission mechanism. As China's domestic financial markets deepen and develop further toward a market-based system, the country's monetary policy transmission should continue to improve in the sense that the policy instrument's influence on economic conditions increases in magnitude and stabilized across time. Using a short-term key interest rate as a standard monetary policy tool and time-varying parameter techniques, this study empirically demonstrates that China's monetary policy framework is in the midst of transitioning to a market-based approach, and the analysis more closely examines the emerging monetary transmission mechanism in the modern era. Chapter 2 investigates the exchange rate pass-through to domestic inflation along various distribution stages in China. Exchange rate movement is correlated with consumer prices both via their direct pass-through effect, and indirectly through its impacts on input and producer prices, which, in turn, affect final consumer prices. The baseline results are compared between the recursive vector autoregressive and vector error correction models. An appreciation of the yuan is estimated to suppress inflationary pressure at various stages along the distribution chain in the domestic market. By incorporating the long-run information, compared to the recursive case, the error correction estimation reveals stronger pass-through effect to consumer price. Various modifications and cointegration restrictions are examined for robustness. Chapter 3 examines the effects of fiscal policy, as a change in government spending or taxes on macroeconomic variables comprising inflation, output and interest rates. The two central issues concerning fiscal policy makers are macroeconomic stability and growth stimulation. Built on the Blanchard-Perotti identification approach, this paper empirically analyzed the influence of fiscal policy to aggregate economic activity, and the effectiveness of fiscal policy instruments when compared to advanced economies. The findings suggest that, inflation positively responds to fiscal shocks, and output is positively correlated with tax revenue; however, a government spending shock tends to be neutral.",2019-05,2023-02-13 13:35:37,2023-02-13 13:35:37,,,,,,,,,,,,,City University of New York,,,,,eoh,,EBSCOhost,,,,,,"Inflation; Deflation E31; Foreign Exchange F31; Interest Rates: Determination, Term Structure, and Effects E43; Monetary Policy E52; Price Level; Macroeconomic Analyses of Economic Development O11; Inflation P24; Money; Socialist Systems and Transitional Economies: National Income, Product, and Expenditure",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2019,1,122,168

The core channels of policy transmission — the neoclassical links between short-term policy interest rates, other asset prices such as long-term interest rates, equity prices, and the exchange rate, and the consequent effects on household and business demand — have remained steady from early policy-oriented models (like the Penn-MIT-SSRC MPS model) to modern dynamic, stochastic general equilibrium (DSGE) models. In contrast, non-neoclassical channels, such as credit-based channels, have remained outside the core models. In conjunction with this evolution in theory and modeling, there have been notable changes in policy behavior (with policy more focused on price stability) and in the reduced form correlations of policy interest rates with activity in the United States. Regulatory effects on credit provision have also changed significantly. As a result, we review the empirical evidence on the changes in the effect of monetary policy actions on real activity and inflation and present new evidence, using both a relatively unrestricted factor-augmented vector autoregression (FAVAR) and a DSGE model. Both approaches yield similar results: Monetary policy innovations have a more muted effect on real activity and inflation in recent decades as compared to the effects before 1980. Our analysis suggests that these shifts are accounted for by changes in policy behavior and the effect of these changes on expectations, leaving little role for changes in underlying private-sector behavior (outside shifts related to monetary policy changes).",2010-01-01,2023-03-16 15:44:18,2023-03-16 15:44:18,1678361895.0,369-422,,,3,,,,,,,,Elsevier,,en,,,,,ScienceDirect,,,,,,Monetary Policy; Monetary Transmission; Stability,,"Friedman, Benjamin M.; Woodford, Michael",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,9230,1,111,172

Using monthly data from January 1980 to May 2006, a nine variable SVAR model is established to study the dynamic responses of the Malaysian economy to domestic and foreign shocks. The empirical results show notable differences: in the pre-crisis period, monetary policy and exchange rate shocks significantly affect the output, price, money, interest rate and exchange rate, while, in the post-crisis period, only the money shock tends to have stronger influence on output. Moreover, the domestic monetary policy appear to be far more vulnerable to foreign shocks especially the world commodity price shock and output shock in the post-crisis than in the pre-crisis period. The findings clearly indicate that the crisis has changed the role of the monetary transmission channels in propagating various policy shocks to the real sectors of the Malaysian economy.",2023-03-10,2023-03-16 15:48:25,2023-03-16 15:48:25,,,,,,,,Structural VAR Approach to Malaysian Monetary Policy Framework,,,,,,,,,,,,ResearchGate,,,,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/M-Raghavan/publication/228649716_Structural_VAR_Approach_to_Malaysian_Monetary_Policy_Framework_Evidence_from_the_Pre-and_Post-Asian_Crisis_Periods/links/564db49508ae1ef9296ac542/Structural-VAR-Approach-to-Malaysian-Monetary-Policy-Framework-Evidence-from-the-Pre-and-Post-Asian-Crisis-Periods.pdf,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,10389,1,221,176

Monetary policy decisions affect the economy in general and the price level in particular. The transmission mechanism can be characterised by parameters such as long maturity, economic variables and uncertain time lags. Therefore, it is difficult to predict the precise effect of monetary policy actions on economy and price level. Monetary policy is currently in the center of discussions about how to promote sustainable growth and low inflation. This study provides an overview of the transmission mechanisms of monetary policy, starting with the traditional interest rate channels, and it explains the operating principles of other asset pricing which are so-called credit channels. Monetary policies of central banks will be analyzed throughout this paper. Theoretical principles of monetary transmission channels are examined by investigating the effectiveness of these channels in terms of the relationships between monetary policies and economic realities. This is done in order to identify which monetary channels are actively working by utilizing vector auto regression model. This paper provides an overview of transmission mechanisms of monetary policy. The results of the vector auto regression model revealed that the traditional interest rate channels of the monetary transmission mechanism work actively in Turkey. It also indicates that the exchange rate channel does not play a decisive role at this level of production even though a significant effect on the general prices can be expressed through exchange rate channels.

Chapter 1 briefly outlines the theoretical foundations for the reforms undertaken in Zambia since the mid 1980s and the process thereof. The main issues addressed were the removal of interest rate and credit controls, exchange rate devaluation and the use of indirect instruments in implementing monetary policy. The review indicates that although the control of inflation is still difficult and figures are still in double digit levels, annual inflation rates have reduced significantly compared to levels achieved in the early 1990s. The nominal exchange rate has been depreciating prompting increased intervention from the central bank. Despite the increase in nominal interest rates, real deposit rates have remained negative. Chapter two analyses the monetary transmission mechanism in Zambia. Vector auto -regressions are estimated for the pre-reform and post-reform periods.Variance decompositions and impulse response functions are examined to see whether there are any changes observed in the monetary transmission mechanism after the reforms. Different systems are estimated in each period using alternate variables as measures of monetary policy shocks. The results show that contractionary monetary policy is followed by a fall in both output and prices. When compared, results from the two estimation periods show that both the responsiveness of prices and output to policy shocks and the magnitude of their forecast error variance decompositions explained by these variables have increased since the reforms. The results also show that the impact lags have reduced. There is evidence of the bank lending channel both before and after the reforms. Of the mechanisms estimated, the exchange rate mechanism seems to be the most important mechanism for transmission of policy shocks to both prices and output during the post-reform period. Chapter three investigates whether monetary aggregates have useful information for predicting inflation other than that provided by inflation itself. Forecasting experiments are conducted to see whether monetary aggregates and selected financial sector variables are useful in predicting inflation.We perform forecasting experiments and compare the performance of different models. We also estimate an error correction model of inflation. Of the monetary aggregates considered, M2 contains the most information and its growth rate is significant in the inflation model. The external sector variables are also important. The results indicate that inflation exhibits a high level of inertia suggesting the presence of implicit indexation and significant inflationary expectations possibly due to past fiscal effects and low policy credibility. Overall, the foreign sector variables seem to be more important for movements in prices than monetary aggregates even in the long run. The importance of the exchange rate to stabilisation policy in Zambia is underscored by the results obtained in chapters 2 and 3. In this paper, we pursue this idea by investigating the effect of central bank intervention on exchange rates in Zambia. Using a GARCH (1, 1) model of the exchange rate, we simultaneously estimate the effect of cumulative intervention on the mean and variance of the exchange rate.We find that central bank intervention in the foreign exchange market increases the mean but reduces the variance of the exchange rate. The explanation leans towards speculative bandwagons and a 'leaning against the wind' strategy. Although there is no attempt to distinguish through which channel intervention operates, we argue that this is more likely to be a signalling effect rather than a portfolio balance effect. This effect operates mainly through the supply and demand of foreign exchange in the market.",2004,2023-03-16 15:49:52,2023-03-16 15:49:52,1678492800.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,en,,Doctoral thesis,,,gupea.ub.gu.se,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,10932,1,221,193

The results of the VAR analysis conducted using monthly data between January 2004 and November 2013 suggest that the traditional channels of interest rates, exchange rates, and credit do work in Turkish economy. However, the most striking finding of the study is the relative importance of exchange rate channel in the transmission of monetary policy decision into real economy. Variance decomposition analysis shows that the explained variance by real effective exchange rates is higher for all variables as compared to the variance explained by interest rates. However, interest rates seem to be still a useful tool to manage monetary policy given its role in controlling the changes in exchange rates. The granger causality analysis points into the fact that while interest rates have a role in leading the volatility of exchange rates, exchange rates have an impact on foreign debt holdings of banks and credit growth. On the other hand, foreign debt positions of banks and other sector firms together with credit growth granger causes industrial production.

Specific objectives are to examine the impact of monetary policy on economic growth, inflation and to identify the solutions for mitigating the lack of macroeconomic performance in Sri Lanka.To that end; researcher uses a five variable unrestricted VAR model by utilizing quarterly time series data over the period 1978 2015 in order to focus on the impact on small open economy. Real Gross Domestic Product and Colombo Consumer Price Index were used as non-policy variables. Broad money supply, interbank call market rate and exchange rate were used as potential monetary policy indicators. Impulse response functions and variance decompositions are employed to capture the impact of monetary policy on the economic growth and inflation. Impulse response for the model with average call money market rate presents theoretically consistent results for output and inflation. Broad money supply presents theoretically consistent with output and inflation only for some periods. One standard deviation exchange rate appreciation has a positive effect on output only for some periods which indicate theoretical inconsistency.

The main advantage of the DFM over the standard structural vector autoregression models (VARs) is that DFMs allow us to avoid “the curse of the dimensionality” and at the same time include the large number of macroeconomic series into the model. The monetary policy shocks here are identified by means of sign restrictions. 57 monthly time series spanning from 2003 to 2017 are used to estimate the SDFM. The structural model is also re-estimated for the two sub-periods which correspond to the monetary policy shift from the exchange rate targeting to inflation targeting in Russia: January 2003 – June 2008 and January 2010 – February 2017. The results for the whole period indicate the significant negative impact of the contractionary monetary policy shock on the real and financial sectors of the economy. The estimated model for the first period points to the non-significant effect of the restrictive monetary policy shock on market interest rates. That confirms the poor efficiency of interest rate channel of monetary transmission during pre-2008 crisis period. The results for the second period show that the most of responses are surprisingly not significant. That could be explained by the several notions. During that period, the monetary policy conducted by the Bank of Russia was not perfectly homogenous. Indeed, since 2013 the Central Bank has changed the main policy instrument and in 2014 finally moved to the inflation targeting and the floating exchange rate regime. Moreover, we found some evidence that “the price puzzle” might exist in the Russian economy for the considered 20102017 period. These results for Russian economy may be interpreted as the evidence that the monetary policy tightening in Russia has a limited ability to restrain inflation.",,2023-03-16 15:39:18,2023-03-16 15:39:18,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,en,,,,,Zotero,,,,,https://icmaif.soc.uoc.gr/~icmaif/Year/2018/papers/paper_1_9.pdf,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,7899,1,221,197

Using the structural cointegrated VAR framework, the following questions are addressed. What is the role of money in the transmission process? What is the role of monetary policy shocks in exchange rate behavior? How important are exchange rate shocks in CPI inflation? Does monetary policy respond to exchange rate shocks? What is the impact of foreign price shocks on the domestic economy? The first model is identified with short run and long run restrictions and the second with contemporaneous restrictions motivated from rational expectation assumptions. The empirical results suggest that the impact of monetary policy shocks on output is temporary and marginal. Leading indicators of output are aggregate supply and IS shocks, the later more pronounced in the short run. CPI inflation is mainly due to aggregate supply and exchange rate shocks. Generally, monetary policy has served to dampen inflationary pressured induced by exchange rate shocks. Foreign price shocks modestly affect short run output and CPI inflation. We draw policy implications for monetary targeting from two key observations. First a positive monetary policy shocks leads to a sharp and persistent rise in money supply. But this is not translated into strong consumer price response. Second, though the money demand is stable, money demand shocks have modest role in consumer price and in the short urn. These suggest that reducing inflation further, especially to single digits, under the current regime is likely to be problematic. This may be due to a weakened link between money and inflation, giving rise to situations where getting the monetary target does no produce the desired inflation outcome and where money fails to produce reliable signals of the stance of monetary policy. We conclude that since food price has the largest share in CPI and exchange shocks have dominant role in inflation dynamics, policies meant to increasing domestic food supply and stablizing the exchange rate likely to help Zambia achieve and sustain lower inflation.",2005,2023-02-13 13:34:47,2023-02-13 13:34:47,,,,,,,,,,,,,University of Kansas,,,,,eoh,,EBSCOhost,,,,,,Inflation; Deflation E31; Monetary Policy E52; Price Level; Macroeconomic Analyses of Economic Development O11; Fiscal and Monetary Policy in Development O23; Development Planning and Policy: Trade Policy; Factor Movement; Foreign Exchange Policy O24; International Linkages to Development; Role of International Organizations O19,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,837,1,221,203

Although Bangladesh entered the regime of floating exchange rate in 2003, central bank intervenes to minimize excessive fluctuation in exchange rate through foreign exchange intervention policy. While these two policies work simultaneously, there was no study to examine the performance and effectiveness of these policies and understand their interaction in the framework of a joint analysis. The paper intends to fill up this gap. The paper develops a structural vector autoregression (SVAR) model to understand how foreign exchange intervention and conventional monetary policy affects the economy along with the endogenous reaction of policy variables. The intervention policy and conventional monetary policy are jointly analyzed to understand the interaction between them and also their impact on exchange rate and other economic variables i.e., price levels, real economic activity and real financial asset prices. The SVAR model is identified through relevant exclusion restriction based on the literature and the reality of the economy of Bangladesh. Monthly data of the relevant variables from July 2003 to December 2014 are used to estimate the model. Impulse response function is used to reveal the impact of policy and other shocks.Results reveal that foreign exchange intervention shocks have significant effects on the Taka / US $ exchange rate and the contribution of foreign exchange intervention shocks to exchange rate fluctuation is larger than that of monetary policy shocks. However, intervention shock has virtually no impact on price level, economic activity and real asset price supporting sterilization. On the other hand, while conventional monetary policy has insignificant effect on relevant variables when its effect is examined excluding foreign exchange intervention policy, it has mostly significant impact on economic variables when joint analysis is conducted. Both monetary policy variable and foreign exchange intervention variable react to each other significantly, suggesting the usefulness of this joint analysis. Results also reveal appropriate policy reaction to economic situation. Central Bank’s policy interventions are working pretty well in achieving internal and external stability of the value of local currency. Hence, present framework of exchange rate intervention and monetary policy may be continued without any major overhaul. However, monetary policy has limited impact on economic activity measured by industrial production. Hence, to the extent growth is adversely affected by inflation and exchange rate fluctuation, the central bank may work towards achieving higher growth indirectly by maintaining low inflation and exchange rate stability.",2017,2023-03-16 15:38:41,2023-03-16 15:38:41,1678261233.0,119-136,,2,51,,,Interaction Between Monetary Policy and Exchange Rate Stabilization Policy in Bangladesh,,,,,,,,,,,,JSTOR,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,7718,1,111,205

In this study, we propose an identification scheme, for a developing economy taking India as a case study, which is able to capture the monetary transmission mechanism without giving rise to any empirical anomalies. We use a VAR approach with recursive contemporaneous restrictions and identify monetary policy shocks by modelling the reaction function of the central bank and structure of the economy. The effect of monetary policy shocks on the exchange rate and other macroeconomic variables is consistent with the predictions of a broad set of theoretical models. This set-up is used to build a hypothetical case of inflation targeting where the monetary policy instrument is set after looking at the current values of inflation only. This is in contrast with the „multiple indicator approach‟ currently followed by Reserve Bank of India. This hypothetical scenario of inflation targeting suggests a sharper response of the interest rate (monetary policy instrument) to shocks and strengthening of the exchange rate channel in transmission of interest rate impulses.

The real output was proxied by GDPGR. Results from long-run nonlinear ARDL showed long-run co-movement between monetary policy variables and real output both at aggregate and sectoral levels. Results obtained from further empirical estimations showed that the response of real output to shocks emanating from both positive and negative monetary policies was significant with different magnitudes. While the response of output growth rate to shocks from positive monetary policy was significant but negative, its response to shocks from negative monetary policy was positive and significant. It was equally noted in our analysis that positive monetary policy shocks to domestic interest reduces the exchange and output growth rate both at aggregate and sectoral levels. However, the effects of negative monetary policy were wider than that of positive effects. This shows that negative monetary policy would be more efficacious when output is desired to be increased.

However, the firm investment in the industrial products and property sectors has only been significantly affected by interest rates and broad credit channel, respectively. Originality/value – The empirical results provide new evidence on the microeconomic effects of monetary policy in a small open economy (i.e. Malaysia) in two dimensions. First, this finding has supported the relevance of interest rates and broad credit channel of monetary transmission in a small open economy. Second, monetary policy effects are also heterogeneous by sub‐sectors of the economy, as some sectors (for example, consumer products, industrial products, and services) are significantly affected by monetary policy, and other sub‐sectors (for example, property) are not affected.",2012-01-01,2023-03-16 15:39:44,2023-03-16 15:39:44,1678274933.0,268-286,,4,29,,,Monetary policy effects on investment spending,,,,,,,,,,,,Emerald Insight,,,,,,Monetary policy; Malaysia; Heterogeneity; Dynamic panel data; Financial constraint; Firm investment,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,8047,1,222,226

While sectoral output effects of monetary policy have also been investigated, there is however a lack in the study on the effect of policy change on disaggregated inflation. This paper attempts to examine the later issue by employing structural vector autoregressive (SVAR) model. By estimating the model separately for each sub-group of Malaysian consumer price index, we find that a modest monetary policy shock results in varying degree of responses in disaggregated inflation. In other words, some sub-group inflation react instantly while others respond sluggishly to a monetary policy shock. In contrast to aggregate inflation response, there is also evidence of price puzzle. The results give some insight to monetary authority on how to control inflation in aggregate as well as in disaggregate terms and in turn manage the cost of living issues in Malaysia.",2011-06-15,2023-03-16 15:43:13,2023-03-16 15:43:13,1678309647.0,,,,,,,Relative price effects of monetary policy shock in Malaysia,,,,,,,en,,MPRA Paper,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,8844,1,222,227

The results of the recursive VARs are broadly in line with the established empirical findings, especially when the interest rate is considered the monetary policy variable. Following a positive innovation in interest rate, GDP growth and inflation decrease while the exchange rate appreciates. When money growth and exchange rate are used as policy indicators, the impact on GDP growth contrasts with established findings. However, as expected, an exchange rate appreciation has an immediate impact on the reduction of inflation. Interest rate innovations are persistent, supporting the view that the monetary authority adjusts interest rates gradually, while innovations in money growth and exchange rate appreciation are not persistent. Several puzzling results emerge from the study: for most sub-samples, inflation does not decline following a contractionary policy shock; innovations to money growth raises the interest rate; when inflation does respond, it reacts to monetary innovations faster than GDP growth does; and exchange rate appreciations almost always lead to an increase in GDP growth. The results from the semi-structural VARs, which impose identification restrictions only on the policy block, are not different from those obtained from recursive VARs. The results show that none of the sub-samples since 1978 can be identified with a particular targeting regime. In contrast, the interest rate, monetary aggregates and the exchange rate, contain important information in relation to the monetary policy stance. Based on this premise, a monetary policy index is estimated for Sri Lanka. The index displays that unanticipated monetary policy forms a smaller portion of monetary policy action in comparison to anticipated monetary policy. It is also observed that a decline in GDP growth is associated with anticipated policy with a short lag, while reductions in inflation are associated with both anticipated and unanticipated components of monetary policy with a longer lag of 28 to 36 months.",2008,2023-03-16 15:48:00,2023-03-16 15:48:00,1678462024.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,en,,MPRA Paper,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,10205,1,111,228

Different studies blame the consequence of this process on different channel through which monetary policy works.

This paper argues that, in studying monetary transmission mechanism process, consideration should be given to its impact on policy and less emphasis on random shocks basically because shocks account for less fraction of the policy instruments inconsistency. It further argues that the effects of monetary transmission mechanism on economic aggregates requires structurally modeling rather than VAR framework that lack policy direction as well as any meaningful economic interpretation. The paper therefore presents a structural model estimated using the Vector Error Correction (VEC) technique to determine the effect of interest rate channel of monetary transmission mechanism on the real economy variables considered.

These kinds of VAR models assume asymmetry as a short-run relationship between the series since the long-run neutrality hypothesis of money states that monetary policy can only affect productive capacity of the economy in the short run, but not in the long run. The recent theoretical literature shows that this hypothesis is not quite right. Thus, this paper examines the extent to which monetary policy has a long-run asymmetric effect on output in a number of Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development countries by using a nonlinear hidden cointegration analysis within a likelihood-based panel framework. The findings indicate that there is a long-run relationship between the real interest rate as an indicator of monetary policy and the growth rate of real output in five countries out of nine under review.

More importantly is the relationship based on regional or monetary union, which has not received much attention especially in sub-Saharan Africa as against the much developed economies. In this paper, the Structural-Vector Auto Regressive (S-VAR) model was employed to investigate the interactions between some selected economic variables and growth in the Economic Community of West Africa (ECOWAS) monetary union from 1980:Q1-2015:Q4. These variables are oil price and commodity price volatilities, net domestic credit, inflation rate, exchange rate, money supply, monetary policy and gross domestic product growth rate. To start with, the study tested for the presence of unit roots in order to ensure the stationarity of variables. This was followed by the confirmation of long run relationship among the variables, using the Panel ARDL model. The result of the eight S-VAR variables reveals that oil and commodity price volatilities constitute important exogenous disturbances to monetary policy. The medium through which this works is the exchange rate; and from exchange rate to money supply. Finally, this effect is passed on from money supply to the growth rate of the gross domestic product. In addition, the Impulse Response Analysis and Variance Decomposition outcomes show exchange rate to be playing dominant role in determining the behavior of monetary policy within the ECOWAS region. In this regard, the supply of money is the major transmitter of all the interactions to the growth rate of the gross domestic product as it dictates the behavior of the GDP growth rate more than other variables in the S-VAR model. One policy implication from the results of this study is that the recent monetary policy tightening in most of the ECOWAS countries to mitigate the rise in inflation rate may adversely affect economic growth of the region. This is because investment may be discouraged as a result of high lending rate. Not only that, any monetary shock especially in terms of the exchange rate could have adverse symmetric effect on the economies of the region.",2019,2023-02-13 13:35:10,2023-02-13 13:35:10,,191-209,,Query date: 2023-02-08 13:47:29,53,,Journal of Developing Areas,,,,,,,,,,,eoh,,EBSCOhost,,,,,,Aggregate Productivity; Foreign Exchange F31; Monetary Policy E52; Credit; Money Multipliers E51; Money Supply; Macroeconomic Analyses of Economic Development O11; Fiscal and Monetary Policy in Development O23; Cross-Country Output Convergence O47; Empirical Studies of Economic Growth,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1369,1,222,261

The responses of macroeconomic policy targets to the trio of Monetary policy rate, Cash reserve ratio and Exchange rate and their comparative impacts in achievement of monetary policy goals cannot be over emphasized. The paper attempts to determine the most suitable of the monetary policy instruments for the Nigerian economy, so as to aid the CBN in making a decisive policy. Hence, the broad objective of this study is to empirically determine the effects of monetary policy instruments on economic growth in Nigeria. In order to obtain estimates and results that are consistent and not methodology biased, two econometric estimation techniques were used. And these are Autoregressive Distributed Lag Model (ARDL) and Vector Error correction model (VECM) after necessary test on reliability of data are conducted. The choice of the ARDL is based on several considerations. Also, due to the change in government policy i.e 2006 bank consolidation, test for structural stability was carried out using CUSUM, CUSUMSQ and Chow test. Standardized regression was used to find out the comparative or relative effects of the monetary policy instruments (Monetary policy rate, Cash reserve ratio, and Exchange rate) on the target variable (Economic growth,).T-statistics and F-statistic were used to carry out statistical significance at 95% confidence level. Coefficient of multiple determinations (R2) was also used to judge the strength of the estimated regression equation. Also, Durbin Watson statistic was used to test for the presence of serial correlation (Autocorrelation), which is also common in time series data. From the analysis of the model for both alternative sub periods, the coefficients of the estimated regression (for both ARDL and VECM) are not the same in the two sub periods. There are significant changes in the coefficients of the policy variables. This means that the 2006 structural reform in the financial sector in Nigeria brought changes in monetary policy rate, CRR , exchange rate and also changes in economic growth. Also, from the two sub periods CRR does not have any significant effects on economic growth in short run, but it has effects in the long run. In the short run, in both sub periods, monetary policy rate does not have significant effect on economic growth. Also in the long run, it does not have significant effects on economic growth in both sub periods. In the short run and long run, for both sub periods, exchange rate has a consistent negative and significant effect on economic growth in Nigeria.",2018-11-23,2023-03-27 14:47:49,2023-03-27 14:47:49,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,ResearchGate,,,,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Magaji-Sule/publication/360784351_Comparative_effects_of_monetary_policy_instruments_on_macroeconomics_performance_in_Nigeria/links/628b5d176e41e5002d3ccd5b/Comparative-effects-of-monetary-policy-instruments-on-macroeconomics-performance-in-Nigeria.pdf#page=216,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,11167,1,111,265

Using the estimated structural model, we perform counterfactual experiments to quantify the relative importance of changes in monetary policy and changes in the private sector in explaining the reduced effect of monetary policy shocks. The main finding is that changes in the systematic elements of monetary policy are consistent with a more stabilizing monetary policy in the post-1980 period and largely account for the reduced effect of unexpected exogenous interest rate shocks.

Negative developments after 2008 still verify the ability of monetary policy to mitigate its impacts. In the EMU, it can be seen in the case of the effects of single monetary policy and the deepening of the asymmetries between member countries. This can be compared to the case of monetary policy efficiency in small and open non-member countries and its influence on macroeconomic developments. This paper is focused on analysis of the transmission process of monetary policy through the interest rate channel in the EMU as well as in a non-member country, namely in the Czech Republic. The aim of the analysis was to verify the similarity of reaction in case of monetary policy shock. The results for the Czech Republic were compared to results for the overall EMU. The focus was predominantly on the interest rate channel of monetary transmission process and its impact on inflation, nominal effective exchange rate, and gross domestic product, the variables that are typically used in central banks' monetary rules. We also assumed that negative developments related to the crisis can distort the transmission of monetary policy effects on macroeconomic variables and that the impact of monetary policy changes is transmitted to the economic variables only partially or significantly lagged. The effects of interest rate shocks on selected variables were identified by estimating a VAR model that uses the Cholesky decomposition of innovations, the most widely used empirical methodology for analysing the transmission mechanism of monetary policy. The results show that the reactions of the product and the price level to positive interest rate shock are very similar for the Czech Republic as well as for the EMU throughout the investigated period 1999-2013. However, we cannot definitively affirm that the crisis disrupted the transmission process from monetary measures to analysed macroeconomic variables as shown in the cases of Czech Republic and EMU.

Importantly, beginning mid-2000s, the monetary transmission performed consistently with predictions of economic theory partly due to stable macroeconomic conditions and positive structural changes in the economy.

The first one is the difficulty to identify the most appropriate indicator of monetary policy stance, which is usually assumed rather than determined from an estimated model. The second one is the fact that monetary policy decisions are based on the analysis of a wide range of economic and financial data, which is at odds with the small number of variables specified in most VAR models. To overcome the first issue, Bernanke and Mihov (1998) proposed a semi-structural VAR model from which the indicator of monetary policy stance can be derived rather than assumed. Meanwhile, the data problem has been resolved recently by Bernanke, Boivin and Eliasz (2005) using a Factor-Augmented Vector Autoregressive (FAVAR) model. In order to capture these two issues simultaneously, we propose an extension of the FAVAR model that incorporates a semi-structural identification approach a la Bernanke and Mihov, resulting in a VAR model that we denominate SS-FAVAR. Using data for Peru, the results show that the SS-FAVAR's impulse-response functions (IRFs) provide a more coherent picture of the effects of monetary policy shocks compared to the IRFs of alternative VAR models.

The evidence is consistent with significant, but transitory, real effects of monetary shocks. The ‘price’ puzzle is addressed and there is little evidence of open economy anomalies. Specifically, initially the exchange rate appreciates in response to a monetary contraction; but after a few months, the exchange rate depreciates over time in accordance with the uncovered interest parity condition. Overall, our identification scheme gives results that contribute to resolve the empirical anomalies about the effects of monetary policy shocks found in the literature.",2000-06-01,2023-03-16 15:50:02,2023-03-16 15:50:02,1678548070.0,561-586,,3,45,,Journal of Monetary Economics,Exchange rate anomalies in the industrial countries,,,,,,,en,,,,,ScienceDirect,,,,,,Structural VAR; Monetary policy shocks; Exchange rates; G-7 countries,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,10969,1,222,296

The factor-augmented VAR (FAVAR) framework used is sufficiently rich to jointly model the euro area dynamics while permitting the transmission of shocks to be different across countries. We find important heterogeneity across countries in the effect of monetary shocks before the launch of the euro. In particular, we find that German interest-rate shocks triggered stronger responses of interest rates and consumption in some countries such as Italy and Spain than in Germany itself. According to our estimates, the creation of the euro has contributed 1) to a greater homogeneity of the transmission mechanism across countries, and 2) to an overall reduction in the effects of monetary shocks. Using a structural open-economy model, we argue that the combination of a change in the policy reaction function--mainly toward a more aggressive response to inflation and output--and the elimination of an exchange-rate risk can explain the evolution of the monetary transmission mechanism observed empirically.",2008,2023-02-13 13:37:07,2023-02-13 13:37:07,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,eoh,Availability Note: Information provided in collaboration with the RePEc Project: http://repec.org,EBSCOhost,,,,,,"Inflation; Deflation E31; Price Level; Macroeconomic Aspects of International Trade and Finance: General F40; Monetary Policy, Central Banking, and the Supply of Money and Credit: General E50; Money and Interest Rates: General E40; Multiple or Simultaneous Equation Models; Multiple Variables: General C30; Production and Organizations: General D20",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,4074,1,111,297

This paper exploits a stylized model to identify the sources of macroeconomic and exchange rate fluctuations in the US. The model consists of a productivity equation, a demand function, an exchange rate augmented Phillips curve, a monetary policy rule and an exchange rate equation (uncovered interest parity (UIP) condition). The stylized model implies a set of short-run restrictions that allow for the identification of the structural shocks in a vector autoregression model in order to test the model's consistency with data. We use real GDP for output, GDP deflator for price, Federal fund rate (FF) as monetary policy. The other two variables are unemployment rate and Nominal effective exchange rate (NEER). Throughout the analyses oil price is used as an exogenous variable. The Sample period starts from 1980q1, and ends at 2008 q2 to avoid possible non-linearity arise from 2008 financial crisis. Results show that more than half of the fluctuation in unemployment and output is explained by two shocks namely productivity/technology shock and aggregate demand shock. Monetary policy shock can explain around 15 per cent while supply and exchange rate shock explain less than 10 percent of the variation in unemployment and output. These results from our simple model are compatible with those from more sophisticated models found in current literature. Hence, our model is more appealing to the policy makers. Further, to gauge the importance of monetary policy in stabilizing the economy, a counterfactual simulation exercise is performed. The exercise shows that monetary policy has stabilized inflation and unemployment, though at the cost of increasing variability in output. The findings of this paper emphasize that policy makers should be aware of the importance of demand side shocks such as policy uncertainty and money supply. A positive uncertainty shock (an increase in uncertainty) may reduce investment and may slow the economic recovery. On the other hand, a prolong period of expansionary monetary policy may make the inflation expectations less anchored. Therefore, the policy makers should try to keep the impact of policy uncertainty at the minimum level and should follow prudent monetary policy.",2019,2023-02-13 13:34:14,2023-02-13 13:34:14,,129-138,,Query date: 2023-02-09 16:27:49,53,,Journal of Developing Areas,,,,,,,,,,,eoh,,EBSCOhost,,,,,,"Intergenerational Income Distribution; Unemployment; Wages; Employment; Inflation; Aggregate Human Capital; Aggregate Labor Productivity E24; Business Fluctuations; Cycles E32; Deflation E31; Foreign Exchange F31; Interest Rates: Determination, Term Structure, and Effects E43; Macroeconomics: Production E23; Monetary Policy E52; Price Level",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,5,1,111,303

The primary result is that despite having no evidence of time-variation within the propagation mechanism of Malaysian monetary policy the average contribution of a monetary policy shock to the variability of each macroeconomic variable: real GDP, inflation and the nominal effective exchange rate, differs between the two crises. This finding suggests that despite the propagation mechanism being relatively constant, Malaysia's monetary policy transmission mechanism evolves over time.

Complications to theoretical propositions tend to arise when economies are less market-oriented and less sensitive to policy interventions, when monetary authorities are not adequately independent, or when market-based and administrative policy instruments are used concurrently. It is important, therefore, to appreciate the unique dynamics of the transmission mechanism in any jurisdiction, in order to understand and possibly predict the macroeconomic effects of monetary policy. This study assessed the effects of monetary policy in Malawi by tracing the channels of its transmission mechanism, while recognizing several factors that characterize the economy: market imperfections, fiscal dominance and vulnerability to external shocks. Within the environment of vector autoregressive modelling, Granger-causality and block exogeneity tests as well as innovation accounting analyses were conducted to describe the dynamic interrelationships among monetary policy, financial variables and prices. The study established the lack of unequivocal evidence in support of a conventional channel of the monetary policy transmission mechanism, and found that the exchange rate was the most important variable in predicting prices. Therefore, the study recommends that authorities should be more concerned with imported cost-push inflation rather than demand-pull inflation. In the short term, pursuing a prudent exchange rate policy that recognizes the country’s precarious foreign reserve position could be critical in deepening domestic price stability. Beyond the short term, price stability could be sustained through the implementation of policies directed towards building a strong foreign exchange reserve base, as well as developing a sustainable approach to the country’s reliance on development assistance.",2020-04-27,2023-03-16 15:50:07,2023-03-16 15:50:07,1678549185.0,,,,,,,,,,,,AERC,,en,,Thesis,,,publication.aercafricalibrary.org,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,11043,1,221,305

The main findings of our study indicate monetary policy shocks have a very small effect on both the Gross Domestic Product and the Consumer Price Index, which is expected, since the Eurozone and the European Central Bank have imposed a low interest rate policy to keep inflation at very low levels. Additionally, a monetary policy shock on rates would lead to a small but steady decline of the effect on the rates themselves over the time period.

To determine the channels by which monetary policy shocks affect the exchange rate, I investigate the effects on various components of capital flows. The main empirical findings are as follows. First, a contractionary monetary policy shock, which increases the interest rate, appreciates the Korean won significantly in the short run as predicted by most theories. Second, contractionary monetary policy shocks increase capital inflows into the bond market consistent with the prediction of the uncovered interest parity condition. This seems to be the main channel by which contractionary monetary shocks appreciate the won.

The first chapter, ""Monetary Policy Rules and Macroeconomic Stability Revisited: Limited Information Approach under Identifying Restrictions,"" provides a new approach to limited information estimation consistent with the forward-looking monetary policy rule. Recently, the weak identification in the conventional estimation method has drawn attention to the estimation of a forward-looking monetary policy rule. This paper identified a particular range for the value of the concentration parameter, for which the generalized method of moments (GMM) suffers from the weak identification problem, while the proposed method does not. This implies that GMM estimation generates spurious weak identification in the estimation of a forward-looking monetary policy rule. The proposed approach allows us to provide stronger messages to the estimation of a forward-looking monetary policy rule. The estimation results confirm a change of monetary policy in the U.S. In the 1960-1979 sample, the policy was inactive and it did not react sufficiently to the expected deviation of inflation from its target. In contrast, under the 1979-1997 sample monetary policy actively responses to the inflation with a high degree of interest smoothing. The second chapter of the dissertation is the extension of the first chapter, ""Estimation of a Time-varying Forward-looking Monetary Policy Rule: Limited Information Approach."" In this chapter, I estimate a time-varying forward-looking monetary policy rule by considering a time-varying structural vector auto-regression (VAR) model for the monetary transition mechanism. Assuming that the time variation comes from the coefficients and the variance covariance matrix, I illustrate this via modeling multivariate stochastic volatility. In a foundational paper, Primiceri (2005) estimated a time-varying structural VAR with stochastic volatility after assuming monetary policy shocks to be independent of any other innovations without forward-looking variables. Because agents are assumed to be rational, monetary policy changes can be incorporated into future forecasts. Kim and Nelson (2006) used a single equation to investigate the estimation of a forward-looking monetary policy rule in relation to the forward-looking behavior of agents. To account for the endogeneity, they suggested a two-step estimation technique based on the control function approach. However, as Chon and Kim (2014) argued, the error term in instrumenting equations for forward-looking variables follows moving-average (MA) dynamics, resulting in additional information loss. Consequently, this paper illustrates that one can recover this MA structure after considering the reduced-form of the time-varying VAR; the procedure suggested in this paper resolves the possible weak identification issues. The third chapter of the dissertation is ""Stock Market Reaction to Monetary Policy Changes: Identification through Heteroskedasticity with Markov-switching."" This paper investigates the estimation issues surrounding the response of asset prices to monetary policy changes. Because of the simultaneous relationship between stock prices and policy decisions, and because both react to numerous other variables, estimation of the impact of stock price to monetary policy action is difficult. In this paper, I use the heteroskedastic structure of monetary policy shocks to identify stock market reactions to monetary policy changes following Rigobon and Sack (2004). Especially, in order to consider all possible sources which affect shifts in monetary policy shocks, such as the alteration of expectations about the future path of the monetary policy and a change in the timing of policy moves, I incorporate the Markov-switching framework to detect different state endogenously. The procedure proposed in this paper can reduce the potential bias caused by misspecified timings in the shifts of monetary policy shocks and produce more precise estimate of the monetary policy actions on the stock market. Since the stock market is forward-looking, I focus on the surprised part of the policy actions within the conventional event-study framework. The empirical finding tells us that the heteroskedasticity on event day may well be a consequence of the asymmetric effects on the different types of policy actions: expansionary policy vs. contractionary policy.

In addition, the results from the causality tests between the exchange rate volatility and monetary policy variables showed that there is a causal link between the past values of monetary policy variables and the exchange rate. This is obvious in the case of the past value of the interest rates. Such that, a change in the level of previous values of monetary policy variables causes exchange rate volatility.

The ultimate goal is to aid in the appropriate design and implementation of monetary policy for the attainment of developmental goals. The dissertation empirically explores four issues on the pricing, behavioural and output implications of monetary policy. The four questions that the dissertation attempts to answer in Chapters Two to Five respectively are: 1) Does the effectiveness of monetary policy transmission depend on the financial development of an economy? 2) Can monetary policy be used as a tool in easing pressure on domestic currencies in the foreign exchange market? 3) Do banks engage in excessively risky behaviour when monetary policy is expansionary? 4) Does monetary policy influence aggregate variables like private capital formation, growth and their interrelationships? Chapter Two tests the completeness of the pass-through of the central bank policy rate to bank lending rates on one hand, and the interest rate pass-through as a function of the level of financial development on the other hand. The results show that the pass-through of central bank policy rate to bank lending rates is asymmetric for three Anglophone West African countries, namely: Gambia, Ghana and Nigeria, which are seeking to ascend onto a single monetary framework. However, there is no evidence that financial development affects the pass-through of monetary policy. These findings still prove relevant, especially with regard to the quest for effective monetary policy implementation and the ascension onto a single monetary framework by these 3 countries. The motivation for this study stemmed from policy discussions and academic debates on the premise that financial development is a key element in the pursuit of effective monetary policy implementation, focusing on the three Anglophone West African countries between 1975 and 2011. The study employs the bounds testing approach to cointegration, and the Autoregressive Distributed Lags (ARDL) by Pesaran et al., (2001). The findings show significant differences in the interest rate pass-through of the 3 countries studied. Ghana and Gambia were characterised by undershooting in the response of lending rates to monetary policy changes whilst Nigeria was characterised by overshooting in bank lending rates. Financial development proved significant in some, but not in all the cases, while economic growth proved mostly insignificant in the transmission of the policy rate to bank lending rates In Chapter Three, we show that contractionary monetary policy of high interest rates is able to correct disequilibrium in the foreign currency market in selected countries in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). The chapter also provides empirical evidence about the impact of macroeconomic fundamentals on the domestic foreign exchange market. The study assesses the impact of monetary policy on foreign exchange market pressure (EMP) in developing country contexts focusing on some selected countries in SSA. EMP is the sum of exchange rate depreciation and change in foreign reserves that is required to restore equilibrium to the domestic foreign exchange market. The study was motivated by the fact that most of the SSA countries are developing economies that have negative net export positions and stand to lose significantly from consistently deteriorating foreign exchange positions. This study thus sought to measure the ability of monetary policy to significantly address currency pressures that arise from trading on the global market. The hypothesis that a tighter monetary policy stance can lend strength to a currency was tested in this study using Generalised Methods of Moments (GMM) estimation in a dynamic panel setting. Data on 20 SSA economies for which data were available for the period 1991 to 2010 are used. The study found a negative and significant relationship between monetary policy and EMP, implying that contractionary monetary policy can ease EMP.",2016,2023-03-16 15:36:38,2023-03-16 15:36:38,1678124140.0,,,,,,,,,,,,University of Cape Town,,eng,,Doctoral Thesis,,,open.uct.ac.za,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,7359,1,222,319

However, from a theoretical point of view there are several other financial variables which may affect aggregate demand, and should therefore be taken into account in the estimation of an output gap equation. In order to assess the importance of financial variables such as asset prices and monetary aggregates for aggregate demand, we estimate a small structural model for 17 developed countries using quarterly data spanning 1973 - 1998.

Yet measuring monetary policy effectiveness is not straightforward; it requires empirical work to understand the impact of financial infrastructure, competitiveness of financial markets, and current economic conditions. In particular, monetary policy effectiveness depends on the extent to which the chosen interest rate affects all other financial prices—including the entire term structure of interest rates, credit rates, exchange rates, and asset prices. This paper examines the effectiveness of monetary policy in Turkey by focusing on interest rate pass-through outcomes by way of an interacted vector autoregressive (IVAR) approach. The results suggest that policy-led rate changes are fully transmitted to deposit and credit rates within eight months. Competition in the banking sector (as well as that sector’s liquidity and profitability), dollarization, exchange rate flexibility, inflation, and term structure all have a positive effect on interest rate pass-through; whereas regulatory quality, GDP growth, monetary growth, industrial growth, and capital inflows have a negative effect.

Methodology: Annual data sourced from Central Bank of Nigeria Statistical Bulletin covering the period 1971 to 2018. The data collected were analyzed using Ordinary Least Square method. The study also conducted the unit root and cointegration test to ascertain the fitness of the model. Result: Long-run relationship exists among the variables and that some explanatory variables (Monetary policy rate, Interest rate, Investment to productive sector) presents a positive but non-significant effect on economic growth while real exchange rate has a negative impact on economic growth in Nigeria. However, monetary supply, which is another explanatory variable has a positive significant effect on economic growth. Conclusion: On the overall, monetary policy is found to explain about 89% of the changes in economic growth in Nigeria. Unique contribution: The study includes monetary policy rate which serves as the main tool of monetary policy targets and as well use GDP growth rate which is believed to be an adequate measure of economic growth as against ordinary GDP. This study also replaced external reserves and output of industrial production with investment since investment is theoretically postulated to have a direct influence from interest rates (both lending and deposit), which CBN monetary policy rates have a direct influence on. Key Recommendation: The study recommends that government and relevant monetary authorities should make financial sector less volatile and ensure the effective monitoring of money supply levels, among others.",2021-10-01,2023-03-16 15:39:31,2023-03-16 15:39:31,1678274077.0,92-103,,2,3,,,,,,,,,,en,,,,,iannajournalofinterdisciplinarystudies.com,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,7998,1,111,345

The augmented Dickey–Fuller test and the Phillips–Perron test were used for the stationarity test. Further, the F-bounds test was run to justify the long-run relationship between monetary policy and economic growth.

Monetary policy is presumed as one of the ways to improve the situation. Likewise, the relationship between monetary policy and employment has generated controversial debates in the literature. Though its connection has been extensively studied, however, the implications of monetary policy in respect to time frame perspectives on employment and output have not been widely addressed in the literature. This study provides evidence on shock effects, long and short-run impacts of monetary policy transmission through the credit channels on output and employment in Nigeria within the period of 1981 to 2016 using the Structural Vector Autoregression and Autoregressive distributed lags (ARDL). Evidence from the forecast error shock showed that variations in monetary policy indicators affect output more than employment in the first two periods; however, it affects employment more afterwards. The ARDL results show no evidence of co-integration when output is used as the dependent variable; conversely, cointegration exists when employment is used as the dependent variable. The monetary policy indicators: money supply, bank deposit liability and interest rate are statistically and economically significant with employment in the long run. In the short run, money supply and interest rate are economically and statistically significant. The findings revealed that the Nigerian government can maximize the long-run benefits of monetary policy through the credit channels on employment. Hence, there is a need for policymakers to look beyond short-run gain and promote long-run employment via monetary policy among others.",2018,2023-03-16 15:45:26,2023-03-16 15:45:26,1678406400.0,103-118,,4,13,,,The credit channels of monetary policy transmission,,,,,,,English,,,,,www.ceeol.com,,,,,,monetary policy; employment; output; credit channels,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,9573,1,111,362

Estimation results showed that in the short run it is output and inflation that drives monetary growth, while output growth is affected by inflation only. Results from the impulse response and variance decomposition showed that monetary policy variables may not have an instantaneous impact on output, but are key determinants of output growth in the long–run. Furthermore, in the short–run the level of production is more important in controlling inflation, but it is monetary policy variables that matter in the long–run. Therefore, there is the need to differentiate between short and long run monetary policy targets. It was recommended that, policy makers should concentrate on short-run output expansion policies and put measures in place to sustain growth in the long-run to control inflation.

We proxied the variables of monetary policy instruments to include: Money Supply (MS), Exchange Rate (ER), Interest Rate (IR), and Liquidity Ratio (LR). Economic growth was represented by Gross Domestic Product (income) at constant prices. Unit root test was conducted and all our estimating variables were stationary at first difference except the component of interest rate which shows that our model interpretation would not be spurious and a true representation of the relationships that exists between the explained and explanatory variables. Error Correction Model was introduced in our estimation in order to have a parsimonious model. From our result, two variables (money supply and exchange rate) had a positive but fairly insignificant impact on economic growth. Measures of interest rate and liquidity ratio on the other hand, had a negative but highly significant impact on economic growth which supports the assertion by Busari et al. (2002) that monetary policies are better suited when they are used in targeting inflation rather than in stimulating growth. In addition, Engle-Granger co-integration test was done and showed the existence of a long run relationship between monetary policy and economic growth in Nigeria. Finally, granger causality test was done on our variables and the results showed the existence of a uni-directional causality between money supply and economic growth, economic growth granger causing liquidity ratio and exchange rates while a bi-directional causality exists between interest and economic growth.

Monetary policy serves as the macroeconomic tool used to combat and alter the negative outcomes in order to maintain viability and balance in the economy. However, the dissatisfaction of the actual outcome in relation to the targeted outcome has led to the discussion on the roles and effects of monetary policy on the economy in terms of growth. The study investigated the impact of monetary policy on economic growth in Nigeria. The research utilized data gathered from the World Bank and various statistical bulletins and annual reports from the Central Bank of Nigeria for the period 1986-2013. The Cointegration method is employed in the analysis of the data gathered with the aid of E-Views on the model consisting of exchange rate, interest rate, broad money supply and inflation as the exogenous variable while Gross Domestic Product is the endogenous variables. The findings indicate that monetary policy instrument (exchange rate) has a positive impact on the Gross Domestic Product by playing a crucial role in the increase in productivity for the 29 years span period and inflation, broad money supply, interest rate have negative impact on Gross Domestic Product. The study recommends that the monetary policy authorities and other financial regulatory body have to come up with possible solution that can help in addressing the long time negative influence of inflation, broad money supply and interest rate on economic growth. They must also ensure that the stability of the exchange rate is protected in order to ensure steady growth in the economy.",2015-08,2023-03-16 15:36:19,2023-03-16 15:36:19,1677522859.0,,,,,,,,,,,,FEDERAL UNIVERSITY OYE EKITI,,en,,Thesis,,,repository.fuoye.edu.ng,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,7207,1,111,374

The role of monetary policy in promoting economic growth remains empirically an open research question, as both the empirical and theoretical underpinnings are not universal, and the results remain varying, inconsistent, and inconclusive. This study may be the first of its kind to examine in detail the impact of monetary policy on economic growth in Uganda, Kenya and Tanzania – using the autoregressive distributed lag (ARDL) bounds-testing approach. This study used two proxies of monetary policy, namely, money supply and interest rate, to examine this linkage. The results were found to differ from country to country and over time. The Uganda empirical results reveal that money supply has a positive impact on economic growth, both in the short run and in the long run. However, interest rate was found to have a positive impact on economic growth only in the short run. In the long run, interest rate has no significant impact on economic growth. In Kenya, both short-run and long-run empirical results support monetary policy neutrality, implying that monetary policy has no effect on economic growth – both in the short run and in the long run. The results from Tanzania also reveal no impact of monetary policy on economic growth in the long run – irrespective of the proxy used to measure monetary policy. However, the short-run results only reveal no impact of monetary policy on economic growth only when the interest rate is used as a proxy for monetary policy. When money supply is used to measure monetary policy, a negative relationship between monetary policy and economic growth is found to dominate. Overall, the study finds that monetary policy is only relevant for economic growth in Uganda and only when money supply is used as monetary policy variable. Therefore this study recommends a money supply based monetary policy framework for Uganda. The study findings also suggest that monetary policy may not be a panacea for economic growth in Kenya and Tanzania.",,2023-03-16 15:36:21,2023-03-16 15:36:21,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,en,,,,,Zotero,,,,,https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/196520991.pdf,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,7227,1,111,377

The goal of this thesis is to examin the impacts of monetary policy on the economic growth in Turkey. In other words, whether the interest rate, inflation rate and money supply have impacts on the economic growth or not. The unit root test indicated that the variables were stationary at I(0) and I(1), accordingly the variables are qualified to apply ARDL model. The result of the F-bound test confirmed long run co-integration between the variables, the figure of ECM is positive, it means that there is no long run equilibrium converging. The study shows that monetary policy only has short-run effects on the economic growth in Turkey. Inflation in the short run is statistically insignificant, while, interest rate and money supply are statistically significant and they have negative impact on the economic growth in the short run. In contrast, in the long-run,all variables including interest rate, inflation rate and money supply are statistically insignificant, in other word they do not affects the economic growth in the long run in Turkey during the study period.

This paper examines the link between the transmission mechanism of monetary policy and unemployment rate in Nigeria. Specifically, the research efforts focused on examining how monetary policy transmission channels – money supply, real interest rate, private sector credits and cash reserve ratio affect unemployment. The Stock-Watson dynamic least squares method and Granger causality test were utilized in analyzing the time series data sourced from the CBN Statistical Bulletin and National Bureau of Statistics. The PhillipsPerron unit root test results reveal that all the variables are integrated of order one. It was found from the cointegrating regression result that broad money supply is positively linked to unemployment rate. On the contrary, private sector credit as a ratio of GDP has significant negative effect on unemployment rate. This finding is very welcoming as it explains the effectiveness of monetary policy transmission mechanism in reducing unemployment rate in Nigeria. However, it was found that real interest rate and cash reserve ratio are statistically insignificant in influencing unemployment in Nigeria. The Granger causality test results reveal that unidirectional causality flows from broad money supply and private sector credits to unemployment. This is indicative that broad money supply and private sector credits have predictive powers for unemployment in Nigeria. Given the findings, it is recommended for the monetary policy committee and other stakeholders in the Nigerian financial system to prioritise increase in private sector funding and monetary aggregates in order to enhance the effectiveness of monetary policy in reducing unemployment.",2020,2023-03-16 15:40:47,2023-03-16 15:40:47,,,,2,5,,,,,,,,,,en,,,,,Zotero,,,,,https://iiardjournals.org/get/IJEFM/VOL.%205%20NO.%202%202020/MONETARY%20POLICY%20TRANSMISSION.pdf,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,8382,1,111,380

But the real sector of the Nigerian economy has performed poorly in terms of sustainable economic growth, low inflation and stable interest and exchange rates. This has resulted in a erratically stable economy; monetary policy-shocks debarred sectors and highly vulnerable macroeconomic aggregates. This study examines the channels of monetary transmission mechanism in Nigeria. The main objective of the study is to identify and validate the existence of some channels of monetary transmission mechanism in the Nigerian context. The study reviewed both the theoretical, empirical and methodological literatures. The Granger causality test was adopted in the estimation of the relationship between the various channels and selected macroeconomic aggregates. Based on the results of our analysis, the study concludes that three channels are functional in Nigeria-the interest rate, exchange rate and the credit channels.

With the introduction of monetary policy, it is expected that monetary stability and a sound financial system would be achieved. Thus, this study examined the impact of monetary policy instruments in achieving price stability in Nigeria for the period 2015-2019. Monetary policy was proxied by monetary policy rate (MPR) and money supply (M2) while Price stability was proxied by consumer price index (CPI). Autoregressive Distributed Lag model (ARDL) was employed to analyze the data in order to determine the “individual impacts of independent variable on the dependent variable. Findings showed that monetary policy rate (MPR) and Money supply (M2) had positive and significant impact on consumer price index (CPI) in Nigeria. However, the study showed that “individual impact of Monetary Policy Rate (t=2.753) and Broad money (t=6.686445) on Consumer Price Index in Nigeria were more significant than that of speed adjustment of CPI to MPR and M2 with positive co-efficient. (0.002414).The study concluded that monetary policy instruments have a significant impact on price stability in Nigeria. The researcher recommended, that well - structured monetary policy instruments like open market operation (OMO), Liquidity ratio, cash reserve ratio and the likes can be used to achieve price stability. Ammonizing of monetary and Fiscal authorities, licensing of non-interest banks by CBN should be considered in order to achieve effective result.</em>",2022-12-16,2023-03-16 15:50:04,2023-03-16 15:50:04,1678548364.0,,,,,,,"Monetary Policy Instruments, Price Stability",,,,,,,en,,,,,DOI.org (Datacite),,,,,https://airjournal.org/gjfbr/wp-content/uploads/sites/37/2022/12/GJFBR-5.446-54.pdf,Consumer Price Index; Monetary Policy Instruments; Price Stability; Relative Economic Stability,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,11003,1,111,392

Primarily, the research will concentrate on the interactions between interest rates, inflation, money supply and growth in GDP, which will serve as the instrument for measuring economic growth. Design/methodology/approach The research will apply quantitative analysis to determine the relationship between GDP growth and monetary policy instruments, particularly interest rate, money supply and level of inflation. Given the advancement and achievement in econometric analysis and computer software creation, the least-squares estimates analysis will be used to investigate the relationship and significance between these variables. Findings It is observed that relationship between economic growth and inflation is positive. This entails that a 1 percent change in inflation will result in a 77 percent increase in the level of economic growth in this economy. The linkage between economic growth and interest rates has also been observed to be positive. A positive nexus can be observed between economic growth and money supply. The coefficient value of 0.02 for money supply growth shows that it has the smallest effect on economic growth amongst the variables tested in the model. Research limitations/implications Based on the findings of this study, the following recommendations can be made, which could serve as policies instruments for Malaysian economic development. This does not mean that the findings can be generalized for other developing economies. Practical implications Observations from the test for economic application significance are based on the signs of the parameters. It was observed that inflation, interest rates and money supply all have a positive relationship with economic growth, which is in line with the a priori expectations. This means that monetary policy has positively affected the economic growth. Social implications The results of the OLS analysis reveal that the monetary policy instruments used for the model demonstrated that monetary policy has a positive relationship with economic growth in Malaysia. A breakdown of the individual monetary policy instruments shows that the interest rate, inflation and money supply all have individual positive relationships with economic growth. Originality/value A positive relationship exists between economic growth in Malaysia and all selected monetary instruments, namely, inflation, money supply and interest rate.

These factors not only influence inflation within the economy, but also the efficacy of monetary policy in its pursuit of its many goals. The South African economy has thus long been a victim of volatile inflation, low growth and low employment creation, which are all matters that form part of the mandate of monetary policy. This could be because of the indirect measures that have been used by the South African Reserve Bank (SARB) to control both money supply as well as inflation in the economy have become increasingly inefficient over time. Therefore, the primary objective of the study was to analyse the efficiency of monetary policy in South Africa, in terms of reaching its goals as set out by the mandate of the SARB regarding inflation, employment and economic growth and in having done so, investigating the existence of cost-push and structural inflationary factors within the South African economy. This study examined the effects of official interest rate, broad money supply, the exchange rate, government debt and government revenue on CPI inflation, as well as on the efficiency of monetary policy in reaching its objectives. It thus determines the long- and short-run relationships between the aforementioned variables from 2001 to 2017. The study further establishes the causal direction between the variables under study. Therefore, the study employed various econometric models inclusive of the Autoregressive Distributed Lag (ARDL) model, the standard ARDL bounds test to cointegration, the Error Correction Model and Toda-Yamamoto granger noncausality test. Furthermore, the study made use of a quantitative research design and included time series, macro-economic variables such as gross domestic product, employment, the repo rate, broad money supply, the nominal effective exchange rate, government debt, government revenue and consumer price inflation, quarterly from 2001 to 2017. These variables were used in two separate econometric models, one of which had consumer price inflation as its dependent variable, with all other variables as independent. The other combined gross domestic product, employment, consumer price inflation to create the Monetary Policy Success Index or MPSI. By employing the unit root and stationarity tests, the study found that all the variables under study comprised of variables that are stationary at either I(0) or I(1), with none of the variables stationary at I(2). This allowed the ARDL model to be used, which produced results that indicated that the South African economy is consistent with cost-push and structural inflation, which leads to inefficiency in the achievement of the objectives of monetary policy as it takes roughly 5.34 quarters for changes in monetary policy to affect the economy. Both long- and short-run relationships exist between independent and dependent variables. The study further performed the Toda-Yamamoto Granger non-causality test and found that variables such as government revenue and government debt have a short-run impact on consumer price inflation, supporting the existence of structural and cost-push inflation in the South African economy. Equally as important, the results of the residual and stability diagnostic tests, which were performed on both models of the study proved that the study models are normally distributed, none are serially correlated nor heteroscedastic and are both stable. This, in turn, ensured that the results of the study are not inaccurate or misleading.",2019,2023-03-16 15:36:19,2023-03-16 15:36:19,1677522856.0,,,,,,,,,,,,North-West University (South Africa).

The results of the ADF unit root test showed that the variables' orders of integration were 1(1) and 1. (0). This condition necessitates the use of the ARDL to cointegration approach in the research in order to determine the long-run connection between the variables utilising bound tests. The ARDL's findings demonstrated that the factors had a long-term association. It also demonstrates that the monetary policy tools (MPR, CRR MS, &amp; TBR) have a short-term impact on Nigeria's real sector production (AGDP &amp; MGDP). Therefore, the research suggests, among other things, that monetary targeting be used by the central bank (CBN) as a tool for monetary policy in order to attain some of the macroeconomic goals of price stability and full employment. In order to allow deposit money banks to provide affordable loans to investors, the monetary authority (CBN) should also evaluate the monetary policy rate and cash reserve ratio downward.

In achieving this task, the study was disaggregated into two models: model 1 utilizing Vector Error Correction Model to analyse the relationship between fiscal variables (government total expenditure, government tax revenue, and export) and unemployment rate. It was revealed from the unit root of Augmented Dickey-Fuller test that none of the (fiscal) variables was stationary at level, but they were all stationary after 1st Differencing. This made it necessary for the study to apply Johansen co-integration test which the estimated result indicated 1 co-integration equation as evidenced by Trace statistic. This also, necessitated the application of Vector Error Correction Model (VECM), and it was observed that it took 61.71% annual speed of adjustment towards long-run equilibrium from short-run disequilibrium for unemployment rate to return to equilibrium after a shock to fiscal variables. The results further explained that government total expenditure, and government tax revenue, had negative and insignificant impact on unemployment rate respectively, thereby reducing unemployment rate. Similarly, the estimated result indicated that export had positive impact on unemployment thereby increasing unemployment rate within the period under study. Similarly, in analysing monetary variables (money supply, exchange rate and prime lending rate) in model 2: Phillip-Peron unit root test was conducted and it was confirmed that the variables were of mixed order of integration which necessitated the employment of ARDL technique. The ARDL bounds testing result revealed that a long-run relationship existed between monetary variables, and inflation. It was found, in the long-run, that money supply caused inflation rate to rise. More so, the result further revealed that present level of exchange rate decelerated inflation rate in both long-run and short-run. While, it was further observed that the one-year lag and two-year lag of exchange rate increased rate of inflation in both log-run and short-run respectively. The estimated result further revealed that the present level of prime lending rate minimised the rate of inflation in the long-run and short-run. Whereas, similar results were further confirmed in the one-year lag and two-year lag that prime lending rate reduced inflation rate in both log-run and short-run. As a result of these findings, with respect to model 1; the study recommended that government should maintain the level of its expenditure and tax revenue as this reduced unemployment rate, and it should lower trade costs so that demand for labour would increase in the export industry, this would make aggregate unemployment rate to reduce.

The data used for the study were annual time series secondary data sourced from Central Bank Statistical Bulletin (CBN) and National Bureau of Statistics (NBS). From the findings, the coefficient of determination (R2) is 0.652 which shows that about 65 percent variations in the unemployment rate were explained by the independent variables. Also, its adjusted counterpart is 0.602 and its shows that about 60 percent growth in unemployment rate can be explained by the independent variables. The unit root test results indicated that all the variables were stationary at first difference and co-integration test confirmed a long run relationship among the variables. The F-stat value of 4.445 confirms that the overall test is significant. The AR root test confirms that the estimated model is stable. Also, the serial correlation LM test and heteroskedacity test confirm that there is no autocorrelation and heteroskedacity in the model.The findings show that government expenditure and interest rate has negative and significant effect on unemployment rate at lag period 2. Government tax was found to be negative and insignificant at lag period 2. Money supply was found to have a positive and significant at lag period 1. By implication, the findings showthat government expenditure, money supply and interest rate are major determinants of unemployment rate in Nigeria since they were found to be statistically significant. Also, the impulse response function of unemployment shows that unemployment rate that has a negative relationship with its past values from periods except in the first, 2nd, 3rd, 4th and 5th periods.Furthermore, from the forecast error variance decomposition (FEVD), it is obvious that the highest innovation was due to government tax and money supply, while the shock of government expenditure and interest rate in Nigeriawere the lowest over the periods.

The study uses Quarterly data between 1970 Q1 to 2011Q4, being a sample period of forty one years. The study further, introduces structural break to investigate the presence of a possible structural change which takes into account the effects of the Structural Adjustment Programme introduced by the Nigerian government in the 1987. The data was split into two sub-periods from 1970Q1–1986Q4, era before the Structural adjustment programme, and from 1987Q1 – 2011Q4, period after the Structural Adjustment Programme in Nigeria. In this study, three approaches were utilised in the methodology. First, estimation and analysis was based on coefficients of the variables using long-run and co-integrating Vector Error Correction Model (VECM). The results confirm my a priori expectation, although many of the variables were not statistically significant. The study also estimates the period 1970Q1–2011Q4, without a structural break for the GDP model having been confirmed in a structural break test. Therefore, we accept the null hypothesis which means that there was no structural break in real domestic growth during the structural adjustment programme, introduced in 1987. However, the structural break tests for consumers’ price index (CPI) and balance of payments (BOP) show that the parameters of the analysed equations were not stable given that recursive errors cut across the critical lines for both tests. As a result of the foregoing, we reject the null hypothesis meaning that there was a structural break for the CPI and (BOP) models. This means that the structural adjustment programme introduced in 1987 brought about a change in CPI and BOP in the Nigerian economy. In the second approach of the methodology, a macroeconomic model was simulated to demonstrate the effects of monetary policy on macroeconomic performance. Thus, the results obtained from the simulation are impressive and generally satisfactory; the results suggest the effectiveness of monetary policy implementation for counter cyclical income stabilization, BOP stabilization and CPI stabilization in Nigeria. In the third approach of my methodology, three structural vector autoregressive (SVAR) econometric models were formulated to trace the effects of monetary policy shocks on domestic output, consumers’ price index and balance of payments position in Nigeria. Structural effects of monetary shocks or innovations were captured by the impulse response functions and the forecast error variance decomposition. The empirical impulse-response assessment indicates that an exogenous shock to the short-term interest rate has the most significant positive effect on real domestic output and consumers’ price followed by a transitory effect of the broad money. The response of the country’s external payments’ position to a structural shock as measured by a one-standard deviation innovation in all the policy variables is almost zero. The policy implication is straightforward- monetary policy in Nigeria is effective in maintaining internal balance and ineffective in achieving external balance. Overall, the results suggest that monetary policy affects macroeconomic performance in Nigeria.",2013-01,2023-03-16 15:48:42,2023-03-16 15:48:42,1678464382.0,,273,,,,,Effects of monetary policy on macro economic performance,,,,,University of Greenwich,,en,,phd,,,gala.gre.ac.uk,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,10489,1,111,429

Whilst inflation has been curtailed to single digit figures since the economic crisis of the 1970s, nevertheless, in the recent past, inflation volatility and unemployment have constrained Uganda’s growth outlook. Like many various developing countries, Uganda has interacted monetary and fiscal policy frameworks as macroeconomic tools to spur productive growth. Most developing countries like Uganda continue to grapple with the challenges of jobless growth which is largely attributed to unstable inflationary pressures as well as low investment which further eggravated rapid expansion in unemployment levels. Government policy efforts have recently been greatly inhibited by rising youth unemployment rates in the country, this has greatly affected Uganda’s growth dynamics. Whilst developed countries have successfully used monetary and fiscal policy frameworks in their pursuit to macroeconomic stability, due to their complex structural economic dynamics, low income countries face challenges in implementing both monetary and fiscal policy to stabilize their economies. Central banks across all countries strive for low and predictable inflation as key in fostering economic growth. The debate over the applicability between monetary and fiscal policy frameworks in the pursuit of enhanced growth continues among policy analysts. The general observation especially in low income countries pertains to the use and effective coordination of monetary and fiscal policy in efforts to stabilize these economies. Despite numerous public expenditure reforms implemented and decline in poverty levels in Uganda, unemployment continued to rise over the past decade consequently inhibiting the country’s growth prospects which has ultimately undermined the econoimy’s capacity to external shocks. Keynes and the monetarists ignited the contentious debate over the superiority between monetary and fiscal policy frameworks which has transformed macroeconomic policy application. A conducive private sector environment as well as large expansions of infrastructure are key fundamental aspects of the development strategy in developing countries, they enhance growth in per capita income. Whilst the monetary authority emphasizes price stability when formulating policies, the fiscal authority pursues its objectives accommodative of the underlying circumstances in the economy. This study aimed to establish an econometric model to predict the impact of monetary and fiscal policy on unemployment and inflation in Uganda using annual time series data for the period 1980 to 2013. The study sought to investigate the influence of monetary and fiscal policy variables on the Ugandan economy in relation to unemployment and inflation. The analysis in the study is based on a twofold oriented objective. The first objective was to investigate monetary and fiscal policy dynamics in Uganda in relation to unemployment. The second objective examined the conduct of monetary and fiscal policy framework on inflation in Uganda. The study analysis begins with a review of literature on the various monetarists and Keynesian theories in relation to the underlying monetary and fiscal policy frameworks. Considering the analysis was a twofold objective, two empirical models linked to unemployment and inflation as well as their relative determinants are specified. The Empirical literature review examined in the study is based on various monetary and fiscal policy theories as well as empirical works by Keynesians, classical economists and the Friedman views. The time series data used were obtained from published sources of the World Bank and IMF, the Uganda Bureau of Statistics (UBOS), Ministry of Finance, Planning and Economic Development (MoFPED) statistical reports and annual statistical drafts from the Uganda Revenue Authority (URA) and Bank of Uganda (BOU). To empirically investigate the influence of monetary and fiscal policy variables on unemployment and inflation in Uganda, considering the use of two dependent variables i. e unemployment and inflation, hence, two estimation techniques were applied in the study namely; the Modified Ordinary Least Squares that comprise of FMOLS and DOLS and the Autoregressive Distributed Lag (ARDL) approach. The estimation analysis in the study contains two main parts which are spread over two chapters. The first part of the analysis deals with the effects of fiscal and monetary policy on unemployment. The estimation techniques applied in the study included the Fully Modified Ordinary Least Squares (FMOLS) and Dynamic Ordinary Least Squares (DOLS) applied to a Vector Autoregressive (VAR) model. The analysis regressed monetary and fiscal policy aggregates on unemployment in a twofold objective. The first sub section regressed fiscal policy aggregates on unemployment using; total government expenditure, total government revenue, tax revenue and trade openness on unemployment using both FMOLS and DOLS techniques. The second sub-section regressed monetary policy on unemployment using; interest rates, money supply, real effective exchange rates and inflation being regressed against unemployment. To test for presence of unit root among the variables of the sample period of 1980 to 2013, the study employed three approaches; i.e. the Augmented Dickey Fuller (ADF) test, Phillips-Perron (PP) test and Kwiatkowski–Phillips–Schmidt–Shin (KPSS) test. Included in this analysis is the test for structural breaks to further determine stationarity in the data series. The results revealed the presence of structural breaks. Structural breaks tend to inhibit stationarity among the variables at levels. However, when presence of structural breaks is taken into consideration, it simplifies empirical estimation analysis under review. The Johansen Cointegration approach was further applied to establish existence of a stable long-run relationship between monetary policy and fiscal policy as well as their respective variables included in the model in relation to unemployment, this further entailed estimation of FMOLS and DOLS in the model estimation analysis. The results from the above analysys show a negative and statistically significant relationship between total government expenditure (LGOVTEXP) and unemployment (LUNEMPLOYMENT). However, tax revenue, trade openness as well structural reforms which denotes the (SB) coefficient all show a positive and significant relationship with unemployment. Additionally, total government revenue (LGOVTREV) shows a negative relationship with unemployment although statistically insignificant. The DOLS results in this analysis all show statistically insignificant results between all the variables and unemployment. The second subsection using DOLS, analysed the impact of monetary policy on unemployment, revealed a negative and significant relation between interest rates, real exchange rates and structural reforms (SB) with unemployment. Money supply indicates a negative but statistically insignificant relationship with unemployment. However, inflation has a positive and statistically significant relationship with unemployment. The normality tests conducted indicate normal distribution of the residuals. Similiraly, the AR inverse roots show stability of the models estimated whilst the multi-collinearity and Wald tests all showed unbiased estimation results. Having analysed the effects of fiscal and monetary policy on unemployment the interest was to further test the impact of fiscal and monetary policy on inflation. This part constitutes two sub-sections. The ARDL approach ws used to analyse the influence of fiscal policy on inflation. The results reveal a negative and statistically significant relationship between inflation (DLINF) and total government expenditure (DLGOVTEXP) both lagged twice. Similiraly, total government revenue (DLGOVTREV) and tax revenue (DLTAXREV) both lagged once indicate a negative and statistically significant relationship with inflation. However, unemployment lagged three times indicates a negative and statistically insignificant relationship with inflation whilst trade openness lagged three times has a positive and satatistically significant relationship with inflation. The Granger causality test results revealed among all the fiscal policy aggregates used, only inflation Granger causes total government revenue. The second part on the effects of fiscal and monetary policy on inflation used monetary variables; interest rates (DLINT), money supply (DLMS) and real exchange rates (DLREER). The ARDL results revealed all coefficients to have positive signs. Inflation and real exchange rates lagged five and four times respectively have a positive and significant relationship with the dependent variable of inflation. However, interest rate and money supply lagged five and three times respectively show a positive and statistically insignificant relationship with inflation. The estimated model showed no evidence of presence of serial correlation through numerous diagnostic tests performed. These include; heteroscedasticity, residual normality and misspecification tests as well as the Cusum stability tests. Under the analysis of monetary policy dynamics on inflation, the Granger causality test revealed that inflation Granger causes interest rates. Similiraly, real exchange rate Granger causes inflation. The ARDL results in this sub-section suggest that inflation regressed against its own lagged values is statistically significant in explaining variations on inflation. Further, interest rates, money supply and real exchange rates significantly explain variations in inflation during the period under review. The results from the above analysis suggest that firstly, the fiscal authority in Uganda should formulate dynamic as well as robust fiscal reforms that can effeficiently be coordinated with sound monetary policy reforms. This ought to stimulate meaningful economic growth in the economy which would further enhance employment growth. Secondly, policy authorities should implement macroeconomic policies which harmonise public spending whilst at the same keep inflation subdued.

The paper explores the significance of this channel using VAR model, as tests suggest the null hypothesis of no significant effect was rejected and a conclusion was drawn that one of the monetary variables such as money supply exert a significant impact on the real sector economy. The main implication to be drawn from these results seems to be the importance of monetary policy channel in regulating real sector economy in Nigeria. The effect of money supply shocks on real sector variables are similar and seem to be significant too.

This study examines the impact of monetary volatility on real gross domestic product (GDP) growth in an oil-based economy from 1970 to 2018, using the Hodrick–Prescott filtering approach. Although standard methods such as GARCH are used to test volatility, the uniqueness of this study is that it tests the volatility of monetary policy using ordinary least squares (OLS), autoregressive distributed lag (ARDL) and IRF methods. We find that the standard deviation of the broad money supply and the real interest rate business cycle tends to have a negative impact on real growth in the short and long run, supporting the proposition that a high interest rate negatively affects real growth. We also document that the standard deviation of the real exchange rate business cycle has a positive (negative) effect on real growth in the short and long run and is not statistically significant. This suggests that the volatility of the real exchange rate does not affect real growth. Moreover, the magnitude of the volatility of the coefficients is lower in the long run than in the short run. To achieve sustainable economic growth, policy makers need to plan how to manage the volatility of the money supply and the interest rate in the short run and develop long-run strategies to manage volatility in the long run. To control monetary volatility, policymakers should also control government spending by dampening the volatility of oil prices, which ultimately affect the money supply and thus stable economic growth.",,2023-03-16 15:36:09,2023-03-16 15:36:09,1677456000.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,7179,1,221,442

The error correction term (ECM) shows that the headline inflation rate responds to the deviation from its long-run (steady) state, and it significantly adjusts to it. The error correction term is correctly signed, and it shows that about 77.3% of disequilibrium in the headline inflation rate due to one-time temporary shock is corrected within twelve months; this is a fast rate of adjustment. The findings revealed that the liquidity ratio had negative and insignificant immediate and long-run effects on the headline inflation and money supply rate had positive and significant immediate and long-run effects on the headline inflation rate in Nigeria. Also, monetary policy rate was found to reduce the headline inflation rate in the short-run only and treasury bill rate had positive and significant immediate and long-run effects on the headline inflation rate in Nigeria.

Central to this investigation is the use of the Vector Autoregression (VAR) approach to estimate time series annual data from 1980 to 2012. The cointegration test result revealed that cointegration exists. The Granger causality test showed that gross capital formation Granger causes exchange rate and real interest rate. The impulse response function showed that output responded positively to monetary shocks, as interest rate increased. For exchange rate and private domestic credit, output showed that even in the long run, the effects of the shocks might not be transitory in order to converge towards a steady state. The variance decomposition indicated that fluctuations in gross domestic product per capita (GDPPC) were attributed to itself. While the total contribution of the real interest rate (RIR) and exchange rate (ER) was relatively insignificant. The error forecast of RIR was attributed by itself with an insignificant contribution of GDPPC and none by ER and private domestic credit (PDC).

The results of the unit root tests show that the series of interest are stationary in first differences. Cointegretion and causality between the variables are tested and compared using tri-variate vector Autoregressive model (VAR). The results of co-integration tests on the tri-variate models show that two Granger-causality alternative models (VAR in first difference and Error Correction Models) fit for this study. In both types of models, Granger-causality (unidirectional or bidirectional causations) between monetary policy instrument on one side and price and economic growth on the other side are tested using Chi – square and F – statistics from Wald coefficient restriction test. The results of cointegration test shows that there is a long run equilibrium relation between the variables. The error correction model and the Wald Granger causality indicates the existence of short run bidirectional causality between money supply and price level, and unidirectional causation running from output to price level that shows that price level is a monetary phenomenon in the short run.

This can take place when the policy instruments – interest rates (Repo) and money supply growth (M3) – have significant effects on these macroeconomic variables. However, the issue of the efficacy of monetary policy on GDP growth and employment creation is at the centre of debates among researchers. Some researchers are of the opinion that the objective of monetary policy in achieving and maintaining price stability is founded on the idea that inflation is not good for economic growth, employment creation and income equality but, instead, only secures macroeconomic environment. In South Africa, the efficiency of different monetary policy tools, inflation and money-supply targeting, on economic performance has been questioned. Moreover, the issue of the high level of unemployment remains controversial among scholars. Therefore, the structural vector-error correction model (VECM) methods was used with quarterly data in order to investigate the impact of aggregate money supply (M3), interest rate (Repo) and real exchange rate on CPIX (inflation) , economic growth (GDP volume rate) and unemployment (joblessness rate) in South Africa for the period 1986 to 2010. The results show that both monetary-policy regimes have positively impacted on economic growth, but the impact of the pre-inflation-targeting regime is higher. Moreover, a weak positive liaison between monetary policy and unemployment is observed, but the post-inflation-targeting regime shows a higher percentage decrease in unemployment than the pre-inflation targeting period. Beyond any doubt, the research approves the engagement of the SARB to monitor (target) CPIX (inflation) due to its ability to ensure price stability and create a stable economic environment favourable to economic performance.",,2023-03-16 15:40:45,2023-03-16 15:40:45,1678282226.0,,,,,,,Economic Growth and Unemployment Under Alternative Monetary Policy Regimes,,,,,,,de,,,,,,,,,,https://www.proquest.com/openview/7c90db48ba115de5d1c5962d1ece0c5e/1?pq-origsite=gscholar&cbl=2026366&diss=y,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,8351,1,111,465

Design/methodology/approach Vector autoregresion (VARs) within the frameworks of Vector Error Correction Models and simple Granger causality models are used to estimate the long- and short-run effects, respectively. A battery of robustness checks are also used to ensure consistency in the specifications and results. Findings The tested hypotheses are valid under monetary policy independence and dependence, except few exceptions. H1: Monetary policy variables affect prices in the long-run but not in the short-run. For the first-half (long-run dimension) of the hypothesis, permanent changes in monetary policy variables (depth, efficiency, activity and size) affect permanent variations in prices in the long-term. But in cases of disequilibriums, only financial dynamic fundamentals of depth and size significantly adjust inflation to the cointegration relations. With respect to the second-half (short-run view) of the hypothesis, monetary policy does not overwhelmingly affect prices in the short-term. Hence, but for a thin exception, H1 is valid. H2: Monetary policy variables influence output in the short-term but not in the long-term. With regard to the short-term dimension of the hypothesis, only financial dynamics of depth and size affect real gross domestic product output in the short-run. As concerns the long-run dimension, the neutrality of monetary policy has been confirmed. Hence, the hypothesis is also broadly valid. Practical implications A wide range of policy implications are discussed. Inter alia: the long-run neutrality of money and business cycles, credit expansions and inflationary tendencies, inflation targeting and monetary policy independence implications. Country-/regional-specific implications, the manner in which the findings reconcile the ongoing debate, measures for fighting surplus liquidity and caveats and future research directions are also discussed.

To conduct this research data of last 20 years from 1997-2017 were collected. Primary data from 57 respondents from different commercial banks were collected to conduct this study. Different economic variables that affects a country’s GDP such as- inflation rate, employment rate, lending rate, borrowing rate, export-import growth rate, broad money growth rate, FDI rate in percent of GDP were used for this study. Both descriptive and inferential statistics were used in analyzing the data. Multivariate analysis technique like Exploratory factor analysis using SPSS version 20.0 was performed to identify the factors that influence the overall economic performance of Bangladesh. Multiple regressions were run to identify the relationship between monetary policy and the economic development of Bangladesh. The results show that factors like consumption, investment, government net expenditure and net export significantly affects the GDP growth of Bangladesh. The study also identifies that the monetary policy of Bangladesh has significant impact on these mediating factors. The research brings an important insight regarding the socio-economic development of Bangladesh by ensuring proper implication of the monetary policy. If the central bank and policy makers focus on the above significant factors Bangladesh will see more robust economic growth in the near future.",2019-05-20,2023-03-16 15:43:16,2023-03-16 15:43:16,1678309907.0,,,,,,,Impact of Monetary Policy on the Economic Growth of a Developing Country,,,,,,,en,,,,,Social Science Research Network,,"Place: Rochester, NY",,,,Inflation rate; GDP growth; Broad money Growth; Lending rate; Net export,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,8900,1,221,482

Using a structural vector autoregressive model and quarterly frequency data for the period 1980Q1 to 2010Q4, the study finds no evidence that money supply responds to fluctuations in manufacturing sector growth or Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth. Interest rates, however, are seen to explain nearly a third of the variations in manufacturing output growth, suggesting that the manufacturing sector is sensitive to interest rates. The study also reveals that money supply variations are largely explained by changes in interest rates. A peek at the monetary transmission process reveals that Algeria employs monetary aggregates as the primary operating tool of monetary policy. The monetary authorities adjust total money supply in response to any movements in the rate of interest, probably to keep the rate of interest within a certain target given other developments in the fundamentals. The interest rates, in turn, play an important role in determining variations in manufacturing sector growth. In addition, the interest rates significantly affect exchange rates, which are observed to respond to changes in overall GDP growth. It is the overall GDP growth that has the largest influence on manufacturing sector growth, probably due to strong forward and backward linkages between the manufacturing sector and other sectors of the economy.",2016-12-29,2023-03-16 15:43:16,2023-03-16 15:43:16,1678309899.0,212-224,,4,13,,Investment Management and Financial Innovations,,,,,,,,en,,,,,DOI.org (Crossref),,,,,https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/f6b4/3bc78ea75d39848ac9a4d40487de11c8f4e9.pdf,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,8899,1,111,483

However, the question as to whether the traditional Phillips curve relationship holds true remains debatable despite advances in both theoretical and empirical evidence. This study revisits this debate for South Africa by examining data on unemployment, the repo interest rate and core CPI for the period from 1994Q1 to 2015Q4. This was in the light of recent developments in both theoretical and empirical Phillips curve literature. The research employed a hybrid version of the NKPC and various econometric techniques. The Augmented Dickey-Fuller test was used to examine the unit root properties of the data series. The Johansen cointegration technique was applied to test for cointegration among the variables. The research derived and estimated an error correction model for inflation. The model results demonstrated that the repo interest rate is statistically significant in explaining inflation. The VECM was derived and estimated to examine both short-run and long-run relationships among the variables. The results confirmed the existence of a positive but insignificant long-run relationship between unemployment and inflation. The study used the Granger causality test to ascertain the nature of causality among the variables. The research established the presence of unidirectional Granger causality running from core CPI to unemployment. Forecast error variance decomposition shows that large percentages of variations in each variable are attributable to each variable respectively.

The study finds that variations in the exchange rate have the largest impact on industrial output in the BRICS countries. It is also observed that inflation rates significantly increase industrial output, peaking after about eleven months. This reveals that monetary authorities should be cautious when formulating policies aimed at reducing the rate of inflation because of the spillover effect on industrial output. Further analysis reveals that interest rates have a marginal effect on exchange rates, while money supply makes a relatively large contribution to exchange rate fluctuations. Again, it is observed that changes in money supply exert a very large impact on variations in the rate of inflation. Thus, money supply plays an important role in curbing inflation.

Using policy proxy variables, several studies were conducted to investigate the impact of macroeconomic policies on global unemployment. However, this aspect explored in previous studies is the economic aspect, while the social aspect has not been well researched. This research thus examines the effect of macroeconomic (fiscal and monetary) policies and corruption on Nigerian unemployment from a broader global social as well as economic viewpoint utilizing yearly time series data spanning 39 years (1981-2019). All of the research variables were subjected to a unit root test, which revealed that they were all stationary at first difference. The Johansen Co-integration test was used to look into the long run connection between the independent and dependent variables, while the Vector Error Correction Model was used to look into the short run dynamics. The study found a long run positive relationship between money supply, economic output and unemployment. While for interest rate, government expenditure and unemployment, a negative relationship was established. In investigating the relationship between corruption and unemployment, the study employed the correlation test which revealed a positive relationship between the variables. Based on the study findings, the study therefore suggested that government expenditure and debt should be restructured in such a way that it is channelled to productive labour-intensive sectors to absorb large number of the working population, hence, leading to a decline in the unemployment rate in the country. The study also recommended that appropriate disciplinary measures should be imposed in those who engage in corrupt practices to reduce the level of corruption in the economy and have a transmission effect of reduction in unemployment.",2021,2023-03-10 13:47:17,2023-03-10 13:47:17,1677055390.0,,123,,,,,,,,,,Covenant University Ota.,,en,,masters,,,eprints.covenantuniversity.edu.ng,,,,;,http://eprints.covenantuniversity.edu.ng/15470/; http://eprints.covenantuniversity.edu.ng/15470/1/Pages%20from%20Ogunwale%20Oluwadamilola%20M.Sc%20Dissertation%20%2818PAF01894%29.pdf,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,6336,1,111,486

Basically, the study empirically seeks to provide answers to four major questions, namely: (i)  monetary policy dynamics on growth in SSACs? (iii) What are the dynamic interactions between monetary policy variables and growth and (iv) To what extent do the identified external factors of oil and commodity price volatilities influence monetary policy dynamics in SSACs? Due to data collection constraints, 36 countries within the four major economic blocs of EAC, CEMAC, ECOWAS and SADC were selected covering a period from 1980-2015 thereby making the residuals both time series and cross sectional in nature. The overall variables of interest as identified in the literature are gross domestic product growth rate, money supply growth rate, exchange rate, inflation rate, interest rate, government expenditures, net domestic credit, oil and commodity price volatilities, and a dummy variable for the global financial crisis. The starting point in the estimation of the models is the use of Exponential Generalized Auto-regressive Conditional Heteroskedaticity (EGARCH) to examine the asymmetric effects of oil and commodity price volatilities on the economic growth of SSA. Relevant econometric tests such as tests for the stationarity of variables (unit root tests), long run relationship test (test for cointegration), Wald tests and Lag selection criteria were performed in order to avoid the problems of spurious regression and unreliable results. Basically, the study used panel data regressions and the panel results revealed the presence of cross sectional dependence which necessitated the breaking down of the analyses into individual economic blocs of CEMAC, EAC, ECOW AS and SADC. In order to capture the first objective of the study, the Panel-ARDL approach of cointegration analysis, which most satisfies the outcomes of the unit root tests was employed. The fixed and random effects models supported by dynamic panel model formed the basis of the analysis for objective two. An eightvariable Structural-VAR was employed to generate Impulse Response Functions and Variance Decompositions for the analysis of objectives three and four of the study. Under the first objective, the GDP, which represents output, was confirmed as an important determinant of monetary policy dynamics across the four economic blocs, even though, this was more grounded in SADC and CEMAC where financial deepening is very effective. The second variable investigated, which is money supply growth rate (financial deepening), is found to have a significant impact on monetary policy dynamics in SSA but the effect is more pronounced in SADC, EAC and CEMAC. The findings further underscore the effect of financial deepening or effective money supply in monetary policy effectiveness in SSA. The next variable, which is exchange rate, was confirmed from the results as an important factor that affects monetary policy dynamics across the four economic blocs in SSA. Although it plays different roles across the economic blocs, the impact has generally been shown to be significant on monetary policy dynamics in SSA. Unlike other variables however, inflation did not display an overwhelming influence as an important variable affecting monetary policy dynamics in SSA as a whole. In spite of this, its effect was found significant in the two largest economic blocs of ECOW AS and SADC. However, government expenditure, net domestic credit and gross capital formation fail to exhibit a noticeable impact as determinants on monetary policy dynamics across all four economic unions in SSA. The result of the impact of monetary policy variables on the economic growth of SSA shows that the dynamics in monetary policy during the period under review have a significant impact on the economic growth of SSA but this varies from one economic bloc to another. For instance, exchange rate shows a more diverse result as it reveals that its impact is more pronounced in ECOW AS than the other three blocs. The influence of other macroeconomic variables such as inflation rate accounted for significant changes in the economic outlook of SSA with their attendant effects on the relationship between monetary policy and economic growth as well. The results of the dynamic interactions between monetary policy variables and economic growth of SSA show that monetary policy dynamics is greatly influenced by the external shocks from both oil and commodity price volatilities and the transmission mechanism channels indicate that this is passed through the monetary policy rate to exchange rate, and from exchange rate to GDP growth rate in CEMAC. As for the other economic blocs, the medium of transmission is through exchange rate to monetary policy rate and finally to GDP growth rate. Consequently, the medium of transmission of external shocks to the domestic economies in SSA is exchange rate for ECOW AS, SADC and EAC but in CEMAC, monetary policy rate is the medium of transmission. In summary, expansion of the economic base of the region, increase in domestic output, policy harmonization, import restrictions and improved infrastructural facilities coupled with increased agricultural productivities are some of the proffered policy recommendations for the SSACs.",2017,2023-03-16 15:36:53,2023-03-16 15:36:53,1677609222.0,,,,,,,Monetary policy dynamics and economic growth in Sub-Saharan Africa,,,,,North-West University (South Africa),,en,,Thesis,,,repository.nwu.ac.za,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,7421,1,111,488

It is however very important that a central bank should respond to the problem of monetary policy transmission mechanism. With respect to monetary policy shocks a monetary authority or central banks needs to know the elasticity of price rises in order to decide the amount by which value of the policy instrument should change so as to get hold of a preferred amount of change in inflation. The monetary authority should also be familiar with the standard amount of time taken for the full impact of a monetary policy shock on inflation to become visible. In cooperation with information of the suppleness, this it possible for the central bank to take timely measured policy actions aimed at managing inflation. The objective of this project was to establish the effects of monetary policies on inflation in the economy. To achieve this objective, a descriptive research design that covers a time series of five (5) years was adopted. The population of interest in this study consisted of monetary policy aggregates used by central bank over the study period. The study used secondary data obtained from the KNBS for the years 2009-2013.The variables of interest i.e. inflation rates, reserve ratios, CBR rates were entered into statistical package for social sciences and analyzed to examine their relationship and hence achieve the research objective. It was noted that there is a relationship between monetary policies and inflation. Evidence from the statistics showed that the coefficients of central bank rate are positive while that of reserve ratio is negative. This implies that there is a negative relationship between inflation rate and reserve ratio requirement while that of central bank rate is positive. The relationship can be used to formulate a targeted policy towards attaining acceptable level of inflation set at 5% in Kenya. The study recommends that in order for the country to realize a stable rate of inflation the central bank should focus on Reserve ratio requirement and develop best practices towards its full implementation. However the use of multiple monetary policy tools is therefore necessary so as to eliminate the bias related to period under consideration.",2016-10,2023-03-16 15:44:02,2023-03-16 15:44:02,1678314307.0,,,,,,,,,,,,University of Nairobi,,en,,Thesis,,,erepository.uonbi.ac.ke,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,9125,1,111,492

Unlike many previous papers which have focused, to a large extent, on the effect of monetary or fiscal policies separately, this paper considers the comparative efficacy of the two policies on growth by applying the Structural Vector Autoregression (SVAR) model to the quarterly data for Turkey over the period 2001:Q1-2014:Q2. The empirical findings of this paper show that both monetary and fiscal policies do have significant effects on growth. However, monetary policy is more effective than fiscal policy in stimulating growth. More specifically, interest rate ―a monetary policy variable― is the most potent instrument in affecting growth. Then budget deficit ―a fiscal policy variable― becomes the second important variable after interest rate. These findings suggest that although the relative effectiveness in boosting growth is different, both policies significantly affect growth, suggesting that they should be used jointly but in an efficient manner.",2015-07-31,2023-03-16 15:43:31,2023-03-16 15:43:31,1678311154.0,,,,,,,The relative effectiveness of Monetary and Fiscal Policies on growth,,,,,,,en,,MPRA Paper,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,8932,1,111,497

Thus, to enhance interest rate, stock price, and bank credit channels concerted efforts are required to increase financial inclusion in Tanzania.  The central bank, commercial banks, financial markets, and other players should continue increasing access and range of financial services; revising lending procedures to private sector; and devise strategies to encourage more economic agents, preferably the domestic investors, to participate in the stock exchange market.

It tests the hypothesis that independent monetary and exchange rate policies have been relatively ineffective in influencing domestic activities (especially GDP and inflation), and that when they do, they are counter productive. Usiing econometric methods, regression result show that, erstwhile domestic monetary policy, as captured by money supply and credit to government hurt real domestic output of these countries.  Indeed, rather than promote growth, it was a source of stagnation.  It also confirms that there appear to be a two quarters lag in monetary policy transmission effect with regard to real sector output.  The results also show that although expansion in domestic output dampened aggregate consumer prices (inflation), it was however, not adequate enough to dampen the fuelling effects of past inflation.  This was accentuated by money supply variable (MS2) and aggravated by exchange rate variable which are mostly positive, confirming the a priori expectations that rapid monetary expansion and devaluations fuels domestic inflation.   A country by country comparison of the single and simultaneous equations model results show that expansionary monetary policy contributed more to fuelling prices than it did to growth.  It also shows that interest rates policy had adverse effects on GDP by exhibiting a positive sign contrary to the theoretical expectation of an inverse relationship.  The results also show that exchange rate devaluations manifest mainly in domestic inflation and have no effect at all on the growth variable, in the short term.

The study used monthly data for the period 2000 to 2013 on the following variables: Consumer Price Index Inflation (CPI), money supply (M1), Repo Rate and the Nominal Exchange Rate (NER). The VAR methodology was used to investigate the response of inflation to monetary policy shocks under the inflation targeting framework. The findings from the study revealed that the response of inflation is not consistent with the Taylor rule hence increases in the repo rate meant to reduce inflation actually increase the inflationary pressures in the economy. This is due to the composition of the Consumer Price Index. Housing constitutes the largest weight on the CPI hence this has an impact on how the Repo rate affects inflation. Increases in the repo rate results in increase in the demand for rentals because prospective home owners tend to resort to renting because mortgage loans become expensive as a result of high interest rates. The increase in the demand for rentals pushes the rental price of houses. This results in higher inflation levels. Furthermore, the study established that the inflation targeting framework is effective in reducing inflation persistence because inflation approaches steady state with twelve months after exposure to structural shocks in the VAR system. The autoregression model of inflation showed that the sum of the coefficients is less than one (0.965) showing that inflation targeting has effectively reduced the persistence of inflation of South Africa.",2015,2023-03-16 15:49:25,2023-03-16 15:49:25,1678492800.0,,,,,,,,,,,,University of Namibia,,en,,Thesis,,,repository.unam.edu.na,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,10766,1,111,500

The prior distribution of structural parameters and shock processes are determined according to the literature. Then, we estimate two different version of the basic new Keynesian model with six distinct chains of Metropolis-Hasting algorithm with each of 100000 draws. Finally, we examine the long term impact of aggressive monetary policy on the effects of structural shocks with the help of the unconditional variance decomposition. Besides, the short term and over time analysis are conducted via the conditional forecast error variance decompositions. Findings: The results of Bayesian impulse responses are consistent with theoretical framework of the new Keynesian synthesis. Besides, the historical shock decompositions of endogenous variables give valuable insight for the last twenty years of Turkish economy.

It appears that after a monetary policy expansion, output is stable in the first period, rises temporarily reaching the baseline at t = 40, and the global monetary aggregate rises but not significantly. In addition, the price level rises with great difficulties in response to a negative interest rate shock to the global liquidity aggregate. The excess of money supply has a transitory effect on the Egyptian output but it causes inflation pressures. SVAR Blanchard and Quah (1989) estimation reveals contradictory results to the previous findings.

Using Jordanian data during a period when its currency was pegged to the U.S. dollar, vector auto-regression analysis reveals that there is evidence of a strong U.S. monetary policy influence on the Jordanian economy. The results show that adjustment of the policy rate by the central bank of Jordan in response to Federal Reserve actions has no significant impact on output while the interest rate differentials tend to have an immediate influence on inflation with short lags albeit small in magnitude. Although changes in the Jordanian financial system structure have altered the dynamics of the distributional effects of monetary policy shocks, the move towards market-based financial mechanism has made little difference to the relationships between financial and real variables. This finding of the weakness of the monetary transmission mechanism in Jordan is consistent with the open-economy model's argument that monetary policy is constrained in affecting real economic activity under fixed exchange rate systems. A key point of this study is that pegging the exchange rate is an impractical choice for a small economy that is interested in pursuing independent domestic macroeconomic policy goals.",2011-08,2023-02-13 13:34:53,2023-02-13 13:34:53,,,,,,,,,,,,,University of Delaware,,,,,eoh,,EBSCOhost,,,,,,Foreign Exchange F31; Macroeconomics: Production E23; Monetary Policy E52; Fiscal and Monetary Policy in Development O23; International Policy Coordination and Transmission F42; International Linkages to Development; Role of International Organizations O19,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,981,1,111,521

Monetary policy shock is identified by the sign restriction methodology. Unlike previous studies, this paper identifies a monetary contraction by a combination of an increase in interest rates, a decrease in central bank credit, a drop in the stock of foreign exchange reserves, and a fall in broad money. The empirical results show that output and prices begin to reduce after a restrictive monetary shock in the medium term, suggesting the adverse effect of monetary policy in the short term and the necessity to improve the transparency of monetary setting. Meanwhile, exchange rates are unresponsive to a tightening decision, which is not a sign of puzzle but plausible when the nature of a peg regime is taken into account. Furthermore, foreign exchange policy causes inflation to rise since its effect is partially sterilized by changes in monetary policy instruments. Therefore, Vietnamese monetary authorities should consider a shift toward a more floating regime to achieve monetary independence or foster the development of financial markets in order to alleviate inflationary pressure caused by foreign exchange policy.",,2023-03-16 15:39:05,2023-03-16 15:39:05,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,en,,,,,Zotero,,,,,http://jabes.ueh.edu.vn/Content/ArticleFiles/oldbv_en/2017/Thang%204/buithanhtrung.pdf,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,7835,1,221,525

The study verifies if the monetary policy, the economic activity and the maturity of the inflation targeting regime affect the supply of credit. Design/methodology/approach The paper offers a review of the literature concerning inflation targeting credibility and the transmission mechanism of monetary policy through the credit channel, it develops a theoretical model based on Bernanke and Blinder and Ferreira and it seeks empirical evidence for the Brazilian economy using ordinary least squares, generalized method of moments and vector autoregressive. Findings The estimates indicate that the supply of credit is stimulated when the economy heats up, when the monetary authority reduces the interest rate and when the credibility increases. The evidence also indicate that the supply of credit is affected by the variables of the model, economic activity and employment are affected by monetary policy and the supply of credit exerts influence on both employment and output gap. Research limitations/implications An important implication of this study is that, in inflation targeting emerging economies, such as that of Brazil, following a committed monetary policy to price stability which increases the credibility of the regime of inflation targeting and promoting macroeconomic stability represents a good strategy for improving the volume of lending to the private sector, thus stimulating economic activity and employment. What the findings do indicate is that developing credibility is crucial for emerging economies that are trying to grow, but with inflation being kept under control. Originality/value The paper presents the following theoretical and empirical contributions: the model incorporates the effect that the credibility of the inflation targeting regime has on the supply of credit and, the econometric approach provides evidence that the monetary policy, the economic activity and the process of anchoring of inflation expectations affect the supply of credit in Brazil.

Design/methodology/approach: The authors use a threshold vector autoregression model with Bayesian techniques to investigate the impact of private nonfinancial sector credit on the dynamic relationship between financial conditions, monetary policy transmission mechanism and macroeconomic performance in Kazakhstan from 2005:Q1 to 2020:Q1. Findings: In the modeled threshold vector autoregression (VAR) specification, the authors document that when the credit-to-GDP gap is low or the credit is below its trend, an increase to the interest rate leads to a short-term economic expansion. However, when the credit-to-GDP gap is high or the nonfinancial credit is above its trend, a tightening in monetary policy leads to an economic contraction with domestic financial conditions being weaker compared to a low credit environment.",2022,2023-02-13 13:35:02,2023-02-13 13:35:02,,195-217,,2,21,,International Journal of Development Issues,,,,,,,,,,,eoh,,EBSCOhost,,,,,,"Inflation; Deflation E31; Macroeconomics: Production E23; Monetary Policy E52; Price Level; Financial Markets and the Macroeconomy E44; Macroeconomic Analyses of Economic Development O11; Fiscal and Monetary Policy in Development O23; Inflation P24; Money; Socialist Systems and Transitional Economies: National Income, Product, and Expenditure",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1170,1,111,529

A non-monotonic relationship between monetary and economic growth was also discovered in the study. As a result, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) should not adopt an interest rate for monetary policy that surpasses 23.7%. Practical implications Because of the non-monotonic link between MPR and economic growth, it is necessary to expand the financial market and ensure that the policy rate does not exceed the threshold level. Originality/value To the best of the authors' knowledge, this is one of the first studies to look at the MPR as a potential source of negative economic growth.

This study indicates that factors that may cause a rise in short-term interest rates with respect to the USA can lead to volatility in exchange rates and thus macroeconomic instability. It is also implied that sustaining macroeconomic growth and decreasing inflation can result in increased export performance, which in turn provides the amount of US dollars to curb volatility in US dollar quotations. Accordingly, this study reveals that high importance should be given to both monetary and non-monetary factors in the open-economy framework to detect the possible impacts on trade and capital flows by dynamic stochastic general equilibrium (DSGE) models.

This study presents a small semi-structural dynamic general equilibrium (DGE) New Keynesian model for Bangladesh to explore the dynamic interrelationships among major macroeconomic variables related to the transmission mechanism of monetary policy. Our DGE model comprises of four key behavioral equations--the aggregate demand (output), aggregate supply (inflation), interest rate and, the exchange rate. Using quarterly data over the sample period from 2006:Q3 to 2016:Q2, we have used Generalized Method of Moments estimation technique, which is useful for estimating forward-looking reaction functions on the basis of expected values for macroeconomic variables. The findings demonstrate that the model is inclusive enough to capture how the selected variables are interrelated. In most of the cases, the study finds significant and similar nature of interrelationships among the major macroeconomic variables as found by previous studies on Canada, Thailand, and South Africa. The model is also flexible enough in understanding shock propagation and conducting policy analyses. For Bangladesh, the policy transmission mechanism is found less efficient to control the monetary system (over 10 years to revert to steady state after the occurrence of shocks), while Canada, South Africa, and Thailand need 5 years, 10 years, and 10 years, respectively. This happens mainly due to the weak monetary policy which has two consequences. First, a small reaction parameter in the interest rate equation which means that the interest rate is only marginally adjusted to high inflation. Second, a small effect of monetary policy on the economy through the output and exchange rate equations. Most notably, in the exchange rate equation, the uncovered interest parity indicates a low coefficient. This might happen due to the absence of inflation targeting monetary policy in Bangladesh. A strong and quick policy response is required which could be achieved by implementing two major policy tasks: adoption of an inflation-targeting monetary policy, and full autonomy of Bangladesh Bank in both administrative and functional areas.",2019,2023-02-13 13:35:21,2023-02-13 13:35:21,,43-61,,2,53,,Journal of Developing Areas,,,,,,,,,,,eoh,,EBSCOhost,,,,,,"Inflation; Deflation E31; Interest Rates: Determination, Term Structure, and Effects E43; Macroeconomics: Production E23; Monetary Policy E52; Price Level; General Aggregative Models: Keynes; Keynesian; Modern Monetary Theory E12; Post-Keynesian; Macroeconomic Analyses of Economic Development O11; Fiscal and Monetary Policy in Development O23",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1657,1,111,535

In addition, a hierarchy of short-term money market rates in Ghana is identified as follows: Monetary Policy Rate, Treasury bill rate, Interbank rate and retail rates (preferably, lending rate), accentuating the large role played by Treasury bill interest rate in the interest rate transmission channel in Ghana. Essentially, monetary authority responds positively and contemporaneously to output and inflationary pressures. Inflation is mostly driven by interest rate shock over the medium to long term, pointing to an impact of monetary policy. In the short term, however, exchange rate shock has relatively larger influence on inflation than that emanating from interest rate. In contrast, output is largely driven by credit and assets prices shocks. This suggests that agents' knowledge about future output prospects are immediately reflected in assets prices before impacting on output.

To estimate the effects of the monetary policy in Bangladesh, at first the impact of different monetary policy tools used by the “Central Banks” of the developed countries have been reviewed. Next, the impact of the monetary policy of Bangladesh Bank and government have been analyzed for which the data on money supply, growth of the GDP, changes in the price level, and changes in the unemployment rate have been quantitatively analyzed. We mainly used Consumer Price Index to determine the level on inflation in Bangladesh. Moreover, our study focuses on data collected from the 1950-2012, mainly focusing our study from the period of 2000-2012 as major transitions have been observed in the economy during the 12 years. We have further analyzed whether there is any correlation between (i) inflation rates and money supply, and (ii) inflation rates and growth of GDP. On the basis of the outcome of the qualitative and quantitative analysis, in the end findings and conclusion have been drawn. We have found the correlation, the impacts of monetary policy and inflation, their drawbacks and possible solutions such as independence of the monetary policy from the fiscal policy and enhancing the transparency, communication and signaling effect of policy moves, keeping the broad money in line with the estimated real GDP growth, borrowing from non-bank sources, and control money supply through various open market operations. Due to lack of access to sufficient data, some of our work is based on hypothesis and models. So some data vary according to the model being used. Lastly, even though, many works have been done from the perspective of developed and other developing countries, much work has not been carried out to establish the relationship between monetary policy and inflation in Bangladesh.

Romer and Romer (1989), Ramsey (1993), Oliner and Rudebusch (1995), and Morris and Sellon (1995) raised some doubts about the existence and effectiveness of the credit channel. Alternatively, several other studies have found support for the credit/bank lending channel (see for instance, Bernanke and Blinder (1988), Bernanke and Blinder (1992), Gertler and Gilchrist (1994), Bernanke and Gertler (1995), Peek and Rosengren (1995), Kashyap, Stein and Wilcox (1993), Kashyap and Stein (1995, 2000), and Suzuki (2004). Therefore, the validity of bank lending/credit channels remains largely inconclusive and an empirical issue. Although the transmission mechanism of monetary policy in Nigeria has been examined in numerous studies, there is no consensus on the most effective channel; and there is scant evidence of the role of credit channel in the transmission of monetary policy. In this paper, we examine the validity and efficacy of the credit channel in the monetary policy transmission in Nigeria, using a vector autoregressive model to analyse monthly data spanning ten years (2008-2018). The empirical analysis relies on Uslu (2016) modified slightly to substitute Bank total asset and Bank deposits to represent the asset side and liability side of the bank's balance sheet, respectively. Purchasing Managers Index (PMI), consumer price index (CPI) and the real effective exchange rate (REER) are used as proxy for development in macroeconomic activity; while all share index (ASI) and market capitalization (MK) denote substitutable assets in the balance sheet of the banks. All series except the money market rates were transformed into natural logarithms. In addition, nominal series were transformed to real variables by normalization using the consumer price index. We find that a positive shock to monetary policy rate has no effect on bank lending to private sector. This could be due to a few factors. Primarily, the Nigerian financial industry is plagued by a low ratio of lending to private sector.

This paper estimates a small structural vector autoregression (SVAR) model for Australia to examine the intertwined relationships of credit with other key macroeconomic variables. At short horizons, shocks to the interest rate, the exchange rate, and past shocks to credit are found to be important for credit growth. Over longer horizons, shocks to output, inflation and commodity prices play a greater role. The response of credit to changes in monetary policy is found to be relatively slow, similar to that of inflation and slower than that of output. The model suggests that an unexpected 25 basis point increase in the interest rate results in the level of credit being almost half of a percentage point lower than it otherwise would have been after a bit over one year, and almost 1 per cent lower after four years. Estimates from the model indicate that in responding to the macroeconomic consequences of a credit shock, monetary policy appears to stabilise the economy effectively. As a result of monetary policy's response, output and the exchange rate are barely affected by a credit shock. The credit shock results in higher inflation for about two years, but it would be higher still over this period in the absence of a monetary policy response.

Empirical results suggest that the impact of the interest rates on investment depends on the level of the inflation rate. The size of the effect of interest rates on investment gets weaker as the inflation rate increases suggesting that monetary policy tools, such as the monetary policy rate (MPR), that directly change the interest rates are robust stabilization tools during periods of declining inflation rates but not relevant during periods of rising inflation rates. This is attributable to low bank lending rates. Additionally, the impact of the money supply target on investment does not depend on the level of the inflation rate.

There is no consensus among economists on the effect of monetary policy on economic growth. The results of previous studies on the effect of monetary policy on economic growth in Nigeria are mixed. The main objective of this paper is to evaluate the effect of monetary policy on economic growth in order to ascertain if monetary policy can be used to achieve SDGs in Nigeria. The effect of monetary policy on economic growth in Nigeria from 1991 to 2020 was evaluated using ordinary least squares regression model. The findings indicated that there is long-run relationship between economic growth and money supply, treasury bill rate and domestic credit provided by banks in Nigeria. The money supply and domestic credit provided by banks had significant positive effect on economic growth; and short-term policy interest rate had significant negative effect on economic growth in Nigeria in line with economic theory. Monetary policy is a veritable tool that can be used to achieve SDGs in Nigeria. Economic growth will increase and SDGs will be achieved in Nigeria if money supply and domestic credit provided by banks are increased and short-term policy interest rate is reduced. Increasing economic growth touches on the objectives of monetary policy of the Central Bank of Nigeria and calls for radical and proactive monetary policy towards achieving SDGs. &nbsp; Keywords: Monetary Policy, Economic Development, Ordinary Least Squares Model,Nigeria JEL Classification: C01, E52, O11",2022-07-26,2023-03-16 15:36:07,2023-03-16 15:36:07,1677456000.0,107-115,,6,4,,,,,,,,,,en,,,,,fepbl.com,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,7166,1,111,568

In order to do that, I estimate three different models that incorporate novel features that allow me to isolate those effects. The models are estimated using recently developed Bayesian techniques (Hamiltonian Monte Carlo) that allow me to consider non linearities and interesting economic features that could not have been considered in the past. In the first essay, I estimate the evolution of fiscal multipliers in the postwar era, using a time varying parameter vector autorregressive model that includes stochastic volatility. First, I find that there is significant evidence that the multiplier has changed over time, once we control for changes in volatility, but that there is no empirical support to claim that the fiscal multiplier is bigger during a recession even if we consider different components of government spending, as some recent literature has suggested. Second, I show that not accounting for stochastic volatility in the model can seriously affect both the size and the uncertainty around the fiscal multiplier. Finally, I show that government spending was extremely ineffective during the Great Recession of 2008, but taxes and transfer payments played an important role to stabilize the economy. In the second essay, I consider the contribution of changes in the conduct of Monetary Policy to the so-called ""Great Moderation"" (that is, the reduction of the volatility of several macroeconomic variables after 1985). I argue that a better monetary policy conduct can be responsible for the Great Moderation and the stabilization of the economy after the high inflation episodes of the 1970s, contrary to the findings of other authors. The estimation is based on a model that incorporates time varying responses of monetary policy to changes in inflation and output, and that, as a novelty, estimates the relationship between those responses and the volatility of those variables. There are two main findings. First, I show that there is evidence of a change in the conduct of monetary policy during the sample period. Second, using counterfactual exercises, I find that after Paul Volcker is appointed as Chairman of the Federal Reserve, the economy would have been more volatile if the conduct of monetary policy would not have changed. Moreover, the economy would have exhibit less uncertainty in the Pre-Volcker period if the policy conducted afterwards would have been in place. In the last essay, I propose a framework and a model-consistent estimation approach for the analysis of the dynamic consequences of changes in volatility. The proposed model is a Vector Autoregression in which time-varying volatility has a first-order impact on the observable variables. The volatility process is estimated within the model, and therefore, the proposed estimation approach does not rely on proxy measures of aggregate uncertainty as it has been generally done in the literature extant. Estimates of the proposed model using data from the United States show important quantitative and qualitative departures from estimates incorporating non-model-consistent measures of volatility. In particular, an increase in overall volatility similar to the one experienced during the Great Recession is predicted to have a strong negative and persistent impact on key macroeconomic indicators, including output, investment and the unemployment rate, and to worsen financial conditions. Moreover, a decomposition of the estimated volatility time series shows that fiscal volatility shocks are associated with important deflationary pressures, have a strong crowding out effect on investment and increase the cost of borrowing. Finally, the estimated model predicts that volatility has an asymmetric effect on the economy so that only rare shocks matter.",2015-02,2023-02-13 13:36:20,2023-02-13 13:36:20,,,,,,,,,,,,,Columbia University,,,,,eoh,,EBSCOhost,,,,,,Inflation; Business Fluctuations; Cycles E32; Deflation E31; Monetary Policy E52; Price Level; Financial Crises G01; Fiscal Policy E62; Criteria for Decision-Making under Risk and Uncertainty D81,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,3051,1,222,570

Employing a time-varying vector autoregression with stochastic volatility, our results are two-fold: First, the spread shock works mainly through a boost to consumer wealth growth, while a conventional monetary policy shock affects real output growth via a broad credit/bank lending channel. Second, both shocks exhibit a distinct pattern over our sample period. More specifically, we find small output effects of a conventional monetary policy shock during the period of the global financial crisis and stronger effects in its aftermath. This might imply that when the central bank has left the policy rate unaltered for an extended period of time, a policy surprise might boost output particularly strongly. By contrast, the spread shock has affected output growth most strongly during the period of the global financial crisis and less so thereafter. This might point to diminishing effects of large-scale asset purchase programs.",2018-12,2023-03-16 15:45:40,2023-03-16 15:45:40,1678406400.0,71,,4,11,,,Unconventional U.S. Monetary Policy,,,,,,,en,,,,,www.mdpi.com,,,,,,unconventional monetary policy; Bayesian TVP-SV-VAR; transmission channel,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,9649,1,111,571

Chapter 2 analyzes an important step in the transmission of monetary policy--the interest rate pass-through from money market rates to consumer retail loan and deposit rates--in Canada from 1983 to 2015 using a nonlinear vector error-correction model. I find that pass-through was complete for all rates before the financial crisis but since the end of the 2008-09 recession, it has signicantly declined for deposit rates. Chapter 3, co-authored with Margaux MacDonald, investigates the effects of unconventional monetary policy in Canada. We use recently proposed methods to construct a shadow interest rate that captures monetary policy at the zero lower bound and estimate a small open economy Bayesian structural vector autoregressive model. Controlling for the US macroeconomic and monetary policy variables, we find that Canadian unconventional monetary policy had expansionary effects on the Canadian economy. Chapter 4 shifts focus to fiscal policy. The rise in US partisan conflict following the Great Recession led to a popular belief that uncertainty about fiscal policy was impeding output growth. I explore this hypothesis by nesting it in a standard structural vector autoregression model traditionally used for estimating fiscal multipliers. I augment the model with stochastic volatility (a measure of uncertainty) and allow that to interact with the endogenous variables. I consider various trend assumptions, subsamples, information sets and estimation methods and find that the evidence does not support i this hypothesis. The results reveal that there is no systematic relationship between fiscal policy uncertainty and output. Moreover, a time-varying parameter version of the model shows that the lack of consistency across specifications is not driven by changes in the transmission of uncertainty shocks over time.",2017-04,2023-02-13 13:37:01,2023-02-13 13:37:01,,,,,,,,,,,,,Queen's University,,,,,eoh,,EBSCOhost,,,,,,"Business Fluctuations; Cycles E32; Monetary Policy E52; Financial Crises G01; Fiscal Policy E62; Political Processes: Rent-seeking, Lobbying, Elections, Legislatures, and Voting Behavior D72",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,3946,1,112,572

GDP no doubt is affected by the Monetary Policy of the state. Among the monetary policies that the CBK adopts in intervening the Kenyan economy, Open Market Operation is the one which is most frequently used due to its easily observable effect and relatively low cost during operation. Via buying and selling treasuries the C.B.K adjusts the money supply in the market and manipulates the economy. In recent years, a modern practice of this policy is used by the CBK which targets the money market funds rate to control the money supply. The research papers of various authors have been studied in this regard to prove the Hypothesis and after in depth analysis by applying Regression Analysis technique it has been observed that the relationship between the two exists. The data of past 10 years of Kenya has been used for driving the conclusion. The study proved that the Growth in Money Supply greatly affects the GDP of an economy, obviously various unknown factors also affects the GDP. This research shows that Monetary Policy has a Positive relationship with GDP although the relationship is not that significant. This positive relationship can be explained by the fact that the level of Money Supply in the economy influences the purchasing power of firms, Individuals and also the Expenditure of the Government. The research further shows that the Rate of Growth of Labour, EXPO, Government Expenditure and Aggregate Investment also do not have a significant determinant on the rate of growth of GDP. In addition, Money Supply the variable of interest was found not to be a significant determinant of GDP in Kenya this is because there are structural weaknesses in the financial sector such as weak legal framework, poor governance, and insufficient infrastructure, which have contributed to high interest rate spreads, inadequate financial intermediation and heightened risks and therefore hamper the transmission mechanism of monetary policy. This is also because when the CBK is targeting a certain interest rate (repo rate) to control the money Supply it is the GDP that influences the level of Money Supply in circulation and not Money Supply affecting the output.",2012-10,2023-03-16 15:34:59,2023-03-16 15:34:59,1677239345.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,en,,Thesis,,,erepository.uonbi.ac.ke,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,6882,1,221,573

The data employed in this study covers 34 Sub-Saharan African (SSA) countries using annual data from the World Bank Development Indicators (WDI), World Bank Governance Index (WGI) and Trading Economics data bank from 1995 to 2019, a span of 24 years. Given the different monetary policy regimes in Sub-Saharan Africa, the data was separated into fixed exchange rate regime countries and non-fixed exchange rate regime countries, and I conducted a separate estimation between the two regimes to compare the different results. The model was estimated using a panel model with random effect specification based on the outcome of the Hausman test conducted. The model relates inflation as a function of money supply, real interest rate, foreign exchange rate, real GDP, government expenditure, Brent oil prices and some exogenous variables such as population growth and government effectiveness which serve as a proxy for private consumption and institutional credibility respectively. Pre-estimation analysis was also conducted to ensure we have a clear understanding of the nature and distribution of the data to identify the most appropriate estimation to have accurate and reliable findings for statistical inference. The results of our estimation indicate that money supply has the only significant effect on inflation while government expenditure, real GDP, foreign exchange rate, Brent oil prices, government effectiveness, population growth and real interest rate have an insignificant or no effect on inflation in non-fixed exchange rate regimes. On the other hand, for fixed exchange rate regimes, Real interest rates, foreign exchange rates, Brent oil prices, government expenditure, population growth and government effectiveness have a significant effect on inflation while money supply and real GDP insignificantly affect inflation.  The study recommends that non-fixed exchange rate regimes should control inflation through manipulating the money supply; On the other hand, in fixed exchange rate regimes a credibility effect may explain the lack of correlation between money supply and inflation. In order to maintain credibility, it might be appropriate to pursue an effective exchange rate policy through an efficient governance system possibly coupled with a sustainable fiscal policy addressing the problems arising from government expenditure and private consumption.",2021-09-29,2023-03-16 15:44:39,2023-03-16 15:44:39,1678362941.0,,,,,,,THE EFFECTS OF MONETARY POLICY ON INFLATION,,,,,,,it,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,9376,1,221,575

The transmission mechanism from refinancing rate, liquidity and hryvnia exchange rate against the U.S. dollar to sectoral lending and economic activity was studied using a structural VAR-model. A significant heterogeneity in the response of sectoral indicators was found, which should be taken into account by the National Bank of Ukraine when setting up monetary policy. In particular, the transmission to consumer lending rates differs from the transmission to corporate and interbank lending rates, as well as government lending rates. Consumer credit rates are reduced due to rising liquidity and do not react to refinancing rates. An unexpected decrease in such rates after the devaluation was evidently due to partial realization of the currency risk. The volumes of lending to the population depend only on the hryvnia to the dollar exchange rate. That is, the National Bank has virtually no direct influence on consumer lending. In addition, the change in interest rate channel from the beginning of 2015 was studied using a panel VAR-model. A positive change in monetary transmission during this period was the emergence of an effective interest rate channel, and hence effective transmission of the NBU refinancing rate to the short-term rates on loans in national currency. The pass-through of the weighted average rate on the NBU refinancing operations to short-term bank lending rates is about 30-40% (that is, such rates increase by 0.3-0.4 percentage points in response to 1 percentage point increase in the refinancing rate).",2017,2023-03-16 15:33:38,2023-03-16 15:33:38,1677110400.0,129-152,,2,,,,,,,,,,,en,,,,,ideas.repec.org,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,6550,1,111,576

While in d,eveloped economies, changes in monetary policy affect real economic activity in the short-run but only prices in the long-run, the question of whether these tendencies apply to developing countries remain open to debate. Literature is divided over monetary instrument to be employed in developing nations. While developed nations target interest rates as their intermediate targets, developing nations employ monetary aggregates as their intermediate targets mostly due to inefficient financial market and uncompetitive banking sector. Despite Kenya implementing monetary policy aimed at achieving stable prices and fostering economic growth, the economy has been reporting low economic growth and high rates of inflation. This inability of monetary policy to effectively maximize its objectives is as a result of the shortcomings of monetary instruments used in most developing countries including Kenya. Preceding from such a background, this study finds significance by seeking to inform policymakers which policy variable relates to output and prices; this would be instrumental in guiding the choice of monetary policy instruments applied, their overall effectiveness and thus assist the Central Bank of Kenya (CBK) in meeting its policy goals of low inflation and sustainable economic growth. The study employs Structural Vector Autoregression model (SVAR) to explore the effects of monetary policy on output and prices in Kenya for the period 1992-2013.

Chapter 2 examines how interest rate policy is determined at the European Central Bank. In particular, I provide empirical evidence against the notion that monetary policy at the European Central Bank favors the national interests of the largest member states. Instead, policy can best be described by a simple voting model where the median interest rate prevails. To the extent that larger member countries benefit disproportionately from membership in the Euro area, this appears to be primarily because they make up a larger share of Euro area economic conditions. By mandate member countries are required to consider economic conditions in the broader Euro area when setting interest rate policy and, as I show, there is little empirical evidence suggesting that this is not the case. Because larger countries by definition make up a larger fraction of these economic conditions, policy will favor their economic interests more often than not. The remainder of this dissertation use data from the Survey of Professional Forecasters to examine the effects of monetary policy on the term structure of inflation expectations in the United States. In Chapter 3 I use the unobserved components i model, which decomposes inflation expectations at any horizon into latent components representing short- and long-run expectations and measurement error, to estimate the term structure of inflation expectations from 1992 to 2018. I show how the model can be extended to allow for two departures from rational expectations and find that each of these channels is statistically significant over the sample period. Contractionary monetary policy lowers inflation expectations after a lag of several years, an effect which is driven by the response of long-run inflation expectations which remain permanently lower after the policy move. Because interest rates and long-run inflation expectations are cointegrated in this model, contractionary monetary policy additionally lowers future interest rates. In Chapter 4 I propose a new method to calculate the impulse response of the term structure using local projections. The method uses the law of iterated expectations to derive a set of linear cross-equation restrictions which substantially reduce the number of parameters to estimate. I then apply the term structure local projections to estimate the response of the term structures of inflation expectations and interest rates after a monetary policy shock. My results confirm the findings in Chapter 3: higher interest rates today cause both inflation expectations and interest rates to decline in the future. I additionally show that monetary policy effects long-run interest rates by changing expectations of future short-run interest rates, rather than adjustments to the term premium.",2020-05,2023-02-13 13:35:50,2023-02-13 13:35:50,,,,,,,,,,,,,Queen's University,,,,,eoh,,EBSCOhost,,,,,,"Inflation; Deflation E31; Interest Rates: Determination, Term Structure, and Effects E43; Monetary Policy E52; Price Level",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2343,1,112,578

The first chapter investigates the external sector as it relates to imports and the potential role for monetary policy. The second chapter jointly investigates the monetary and external sectors regarding monetary exchange rate policy and its implications. The third chapter investigates the monetary sector concerning monetary policy operating procedures and the macroeconomic effects. The first chapter examines liquidity effects on the demand for imports of non-durable consumers' goods in Trinidad and Tobago. A parsimonious vector equilibrium correction model (VEqCM) is developed to test the hypotheses that liquidity has both long- and short-run effects. Multivariate cointegration analysis reveals a long-run relation among consumers' imports, output, liquidity and relative prices. General-to-specific (Gets) modeling via Autometrics reveals significant short-run liquidity and asymmetric foreign and domestic price effects. The VEqCM seems a sufficient approximation of the underlying data generation process, demonstrates desirable statistical properties and empirically constant parameters, encompasses the findings of previous specifications and produces reliable forecasts. The second chapter presents an approach for empirically estimating long-run monetary policy rules in small open economies. The approach utilizes the cointegrated VAR methodology and statistical tests on long- and short-run relations, and investigates policy responses. An application is presented for the case of Trinidad and Tobago. The analysis reveals an empirically supported long-run monetary policy rule for the nominal exchange rate, and also provides empirical evidence that oil price shocks are transmitted through the TT economy in part via the effects on US prices. Dynamic specification of the nominal exchange rate reveals significant adjustment towards the target equilibrium level, and significant effects from foreign and domestic variables save for the exchange rate. The parsimonious model and its parameter estimates are empirically constant and generate reliable forecasts that provide important implications for using estimated policy rules. The third chapter investigates the extent to which the effects of the Dutch Disease are brought on by the monetary policy responses, perhaps systematic, to energy sector economic activity. The approach utilizes impulse response analysis and the cointegrated VAR methodology. The Trinidad and Tobago economy is examined. There are three key findings: (i) both the long-run and short- run energy and non-energy income elasticities of inflation are asymmetric, (ii) monetary policy and its targets respond asymmetrically to energy and non-energy income shocks, and (iii) systematic policy responses to energy and non-energy income shocks are asymmetric and make worse the Dutch Disease. Policy implications suggest that macroeconomic policy based on empirical models relying solely on aggregate measures of economic activity may lack congruence and therefore may not yield valid or useful policy inferences, particularly for economies with enclave economic sectors.",2018-08,2023-02-13 13:36:14,2023-02-13 13:36:14,,,,,,,,,,,,,George Washington University,,,,,eoh,,EBSCOhost,,,,,,Open Economy Macroeconomics F41; Macroeconomic Analyses of Economic Development O11; Fiscal and Monetary Policy in Development O23; Development Planning and Policy: Trade Policy; Factor Movement; Foreign Exchange Policy O24; Energy; Economic Development: Agriculture; Environment; Natural Resources; Other Primary Products O13; Nonrenewable Resources and Conservation: General Q30,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2903,1,222,579

The SVAR approach has been developed over the last decade to interpret business cycle fluctuations and to help identify the effects of different economic policies. It is an extension on the traditional atheoretic VAR approach in that it combines economic theory with time-series analysis to determine the dynamic response of economic variables to various disturbances. The main advantage with SVAR analysis is that the necessary restrictions on the estimated reduced form model, required for identification of the underlying structural model, can be provided by economic theory. These restrictions can be either contemporaneous or long-run in nature depending on whether the underlying disturbances are considered to be temporary or permanent in nature. Once the identification is achieved it is possible to recover the structural shocks. These shocks can then be used to generate impulse response and variance decomposition functions to assess the dynamic impacts on different economic variables. In addition these functions can be used to test whether such shocks affect the economic variables as economic theory would predict so providing a check on the theory. SVAR analysis has been used internationally to examine a variety of research topics, such as asymmetric shocks from monetary union and impacts of exchange rate movements. A number of research topics in the Irish context that could benefit from SVAR analysis are identified. These topics relate mainly to areas of inflation, exchange rate and monetary policy. The SVAR is an important and useful methodology that is worthy of more attention by the Irish economics community than it currently receives.",1997,2023-02-13 13:38:12,2023-02-13 13:38:12,,26-pages,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,eoh,Availability Note: Information provided in collaboration with the RePEc Project: http://repec.org,EBSCOhost,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,5457,1,222,583

It consists of three chapters: Chapter 1 revisits the definition of monetary policy autonomy and develops a new method to identify autonomy regimes for a set of countries. Compared to the traditional identification approach, which only focuses on correlations with the base country interest rate, monetary policy autonomy discussed in this paper is jointly determined by how the domestic interest rate responds to the foreign monetary policy as well as its domestic inflation and real GDP. Using a Bayesian Markov Switching model for the monetary policy function, I estimate policy responses in two regimes, and obtain measures of monetary policy autonomy in the estimation process. Testing the method with case studies and simulated data demonstrates the robustness of the approach under different scenarios. Applying the method to the data of a set of advanced countries, I find monetary policy autonomy decreases when the exchange rate is fixed or capital controls are loosened, which is consistent with the open economy trilemma. Chapter 2 extends the discussion in chapter 1. When using a Markov switching model to identify monetary policy autonomy, one question that needs to be addressed is: Given the limited number of observations, how well does the method actually work? By changing parameters in the data generating processes, this paper conducts simulation exercises under different scenarios. Results indicate that, in order to properly identify high and low autonomy, a larger variance in the error term requires greater differences between switching parameters in the two states. In practice, regime classification therefore can be polluted by large variances. To better identify the monetary policy autonomy regime, I adopt the regime switching model introduced by Kaufmann (2015) and show that incorporating endogenous switching could help to improve estimations. Chapter 3 studies monetary policy with a fixed exchange rate regime. Based on the study of Posch (2007), strong evidence of Jumps has been found in industrial production series. Instead of focusing on structural general equilibrium models, this paper incorporates jump process into a Vector Autoregression model and applies it to evaluate monetary policy effects in a fixed exchange rate regime. As with outliers in industrial production data, financial variables in a country with a fixed exchange rate regime also present non-normality. One of the reasons is that pegs with no capital controls are fragile to speculative attacks. An attack can result in an abrupt increase in either the interest rate or the exchange rate. Given that the outliers in the data may bias the estimation, we use the jump component to model and separate outliers from the underlying dynamic system. Based on the case study of Denmark, the traditional VAR model indicates that impacts of a monetary policy shock on domestic variables are weak. After controlling for outliers, it indicates that a contractionary monetary policy shock has significant negative impacts on both industrial production and CPI. Meanwhile, its impacts on the exchange rate are also discussed in the paper.",2017-08,2023-02-13 13:35:26,2023-02-13 13:35:26,,,,,,,,,,,,,George Washington University,,,,,eoh,,EBSCOhost,,,,,,Inflation; Deflation E31; Macroeconomics: Production E23; Monetary Policy E52; Price Level; International Monetary Arrangements and Institutions F33; Open Economy Macroeconomics F41,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1778,1,221,584

My dissertation is motivated by the fact that financial intermediation plays a critical role in economic development in low income economies. Assessment of financial sector performance is instrumental to understand the dynamics of economic growth. My dissertation's contribution to the empirical literature on least developed economies stems from adopting rigorous and robust econometric techniques to high quality data. This paves the way forward to better assess the effectiveness of monetary policy and efficiency of financial intermediation in these economies. My analysis, which focuses on Egypt takes into consideration various political, economic and social transformations that took place during the past five decades and which have substantially affected the macroeconomic performance of the country. My dissertation follows the primary model for dissertations and is divided into three different essays. The first essay examines the Demand for Money in Egypt. The second essay investigates the presence of a Broad Credit Channel for Monetary Transmission. In the third essay, I present an Aggregate Model for Savings Behavior and its Determinants in Egypt. The objective and proposed scope of my research is detailed below. The first chapter studies money demand which is critical for defining monetary policy options. In the context of developed economies with fully functioning financial markets, money demand is influenced by transaction demand, speculation motive and opportunity costs. This doesn't hold for least developed economies where market imperfections and frictions can play a key role in money demand dynamics. These factors weren't adequately covered in the empirical literature. This chapter attempts to cover these aspect and contribute to the empirical literature with particular emphasis to Egypt. The chapter provides a mixed strategy for estimating the money demand function that incorporates shifting from a system of equations vector auto regression (VAR) approach that maintains the information relating to the feedback between variables, followed by vector equilibrium correction model (VECM) in order to investigate the nature of short term and long term interactions. Key conclusion is that real money demand in Egypt is stable and can be confidently considered by monetary authorities as an important tool to adjust for long run growth in the real economy. The second chapter focuses on the credit channel for monetary policy in Egypt. Past research has shown that healthy financial intermediation should be able to support monetary policy and has the potential to mitigate transmitting economic shocks to the real sector (Bernanke, 2007; and Stein, 1998). However most of the past research has focused on developed economies with little research being devoted to low income countries. was devoted to least developed economies despite their relatively higher contingency to volatility, political instability and difficulty in obtaining reliable data (Fernandez, 2003). The objective of this paper is to fill this gap in the literature and in particular provide answers to three main questions regarding the conduct of monetary policy in Egypt: (i) Does banks credit operate as a transmission channel for monetary policy? If not, what is the alternative channel that transmits monetary policy in Egypt? (ii) Is the credit channel important to guide monetary authorities and financial economics profession? (iii) And finally, how can Structural Vector Auto Regression (SVAR) be adopted to model monetary policy strategy for Egypt? Our findings confirm the existence of a--statistically significant--credit channel for monetary policy when considering the monetary base as an operating target. The key outcome is that the credit channel--if properly considered--can help authorities propagate monetary policy shocks to the real economy In the third chapter, I study the behavior of savings in Egypt. Private sector savings play a pivotal role in financing development and sustaining growth. Understanding the dynamics of determinants of savings is critical to inform economic policy and devise reform programs. The Egyptian government adopted an economic reform program in the 1990's, the main pillar of which was to support financial development and achieve economic growth. This followed a full liberalization of interest rates, allowing markets to determine the opportunity cost of holding money. The purpose of this paper is to investigate private savings behavior in Egypt--for the first time--using quarterly data covering 1991-2010 and adopting a Vector Equilibrium Correction Model (VECM). The key finding is that Egypt's private savings follow the Life Cycle Model proposed by Modigliani 1954 in the long term. Controlling for population growth; empirical results indicate that real interest rate and financial development are key determinants for real private savings in the long run. However, in the short run economic uncertainty proxied by inflation and devaluation of the exchange rate are key determinants of private savings decisions. Robust macroeconomic and monetary policies are pre-requisites to maximize private savings and financing growth in Egypt.",2016-05,2023-02-13 13:34:51,2023-02-13 13:34:51,,,,,,,,,,,,,George Washington University,,,,,eoh,,EBSCOhost,,,,,,Monetary Policy E52; Financial Markets and the Macroeconomy E44; Fiscal and Monetary Policy in Development O23,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,937,1,222,587

As the differences among Eurozone countries still exist, the question is whether the common monetary policy can similarly control and influence the development of inflation and economic performance in the individual union's countries. The reaction of inflation, product and exchange rate on 1% positive interest rate shock is examined via vector autoregression (VAR) model. We implement recursive Cholesky decomposition of variance-covariance matrix of model residuals. To estimate the model, we employ monthly data for period 2000M1-2019M7 consisting of 235 observations. VAR model allows computing impulse-response functions for estimation of interest rate pass-through to macroeconomic variables. We verify the similarity of individual responses to interest rate shock of four different Eurozone countries (Austria, Germany, France and Slovakia). The results show that the interest rate channel did not reveal particularly a strong and stable effect on the observed variables. For a reaction of prices, the theory indicates that the increase of interest rate should slow down the increase of prices causing the inflation rate to drop down. Although, the reaction of inflation on the monetary policy interest rate shock is in line with economic assumption, its intensity is very weak. It could indicate the future complication of monetary policy and its interest rate channel in affecting inflation behavior in Eurozone countries.",2021,2023-02-13 13:35:17,2023-02-13 13:35:17,,23-35,,2,17,,Montenegrin Journal of Economics,,,,,,,,,,,eoh,,EBSCOhost,,,,,,"Inflation; Deflation E31; Foreign Exchange F31; Interest Rates: Determination, Term Structure, and Effects E43; Monetary Policy E52; Price Level",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1551,1,111,589

Though, in responding to the macroeconomic consequences of the shock in growth of private sector credit, monetary policy appears to stabilise the economy effectively. At short horizons, shocks to monetary policy found to be a significant driver of credit growth. Over longer horizons, shocks to real output, past shocks to credit growth and external shocks plays a greater role. The contemporaneous effects of external shocks to the growth of private sector credit takes slightly more than two years to disappears, but it would have taken much longer in the absence of a monetary policy response.

This VAR is estimated separately for 19 industrialised countries over 1980Q1-2010Q4 using three alternative measures of economic activity: GDP, private consumption or total investment. Financial shocks are identified by imposing a recursive structure (Choleski decomposition). Several results stand out. First, the effect of financial shocks on the real economy is fairly heterogeneous across countries, confirming previous findings in the literature. Second, the five financial shocks provide a surprisingly large contribution to explaining real fluctuations (33% of GDP variance at the 3-year horizon on average across countries) exceeding the contribution from monetary policy shocks. Third, the most important source of real fluctuations appears to be shocks to asset prices (real stock prices account for 12% of GDP variance and real house prices for 9%). Shocks to the term spread or to leverage (credit-to-GDP ratio or loans-to-deposits ratio) each contribute an additional 3-4% of GDP variance. Fourth, the combined contribution of the five financial shocks is usually higher for fluctuations in investment than in private consumption. Fifth, historical decompositions indicate that financial shocks provide much more important contributions to output fluctuations during episodes associated with financial imbalances (both booms and busts). This suggests possible time-variation or non-linearities in macrofinancial linkages that are left for future research.",2012,2023-02-13 13:34:54,2023-02-13 13:34:54,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,eoh,Availability Note: Information provided in collaboration with the RePEc Project: http://repec.org,EBSCOhost,,,,,,Business Fluctuations; Cycles E32; Diffusion Processes; Dynamic Quantile Regressions; Dynamic Treatment Effect Models; Multiple or Simultaneous Equation Models: Time-Series Models; State Space Models C32; Financial Markets and the Macroeconomy E44; Credit; Money Multipliers E51; Money Supply,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1014,1,221,598

First, I study the perspective of equity investors and their reaction to the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) announcements, when they disagree on Nominal Interest Rate level decisions. My evidence shows that investor expectations formulated prior to FOMC announcements have a significant impact on equity prices, particularly when these expectations are not aligned with the FOMC committee decisions. My results reconcile past findings on the monetary policy surprise literature and more recent empirical findings on the effect of FOMC announcements on equity markets. Moreover, as I find no effect on equity returns when the FOMC committee decision is anticipated by the market, a practical implication of my study is that monetary policy authorities should take into account market expectations when formulating disclosure policy in order to improve alignment with financial market expectations and smooth out their economic consequences. Second, I provide evidence of the effects of the European Central Bank (ECB) monetary policy shocks on the real economy, specifically on industrial production and inflation. This analysis investigates how the ECB monetary policy shocks impact industrial production (output) and inflation (prices) following the established narrative methodology of Romer & Romer (2004). Past standard statistical approaches have yielded very limited results in terms of magnitude. The narrative methodology, conversely, has yielded significant effects of monetary shocks on prices and output. Most of these studies analysed the effect of monetary policy in the United States and only a recent portion of the literature has extended the analysis to other countries (United Kingdom and Canada). This chapter contributes to the extant literature in extending the narrative methodology to the Eurozone and adapting it to include the unconventional monetary policies put in place by the Governing Council of the ECB in the past decade. To do so, I gather a novel dataset of macroeconomic forecasts and construct a new measure of monetary policy shocks. Industrial production responds to unpredictable monetary policy shocks with a decline of over 0.5%. On the contrary, inflation responds weakly to monetary shocks, with a very modest and unstable decrease of 0.05%. Furthermore, I provide empirical evidence of the heterogeneous responses of inflation and output among Eurozone countries. These last results are particularly relevant to policy makers of the ECB Governing Council, given that their policy decisions should have a homogenous effect on the Eurozone economy. Third, I investigate whether financial market stability is a concern for monetary policy makers in the case of the European Central Bank (ECB) and Bank of England (BOE). Whether financial market stability should be a concern of monetary policy makers is an unresolved and long debated question, which has resurfaced after the 2008 financial crisis. In this chapter, I propose a forward-looking Augmented Taylor (1993) Rule to investigate the conduct of monetary policy and apply this idea to the 2003–2018 time period for both the ECB and the BOE. I show that a forward-looking Augmented Taylor Rule explains the deviation of observed rates consistent with its implied rates. By including a measure of Financial Market Stability Slack, I also show that the evolving preferences of monetary policy makers have taken into account the financial markets turmoil, particularly in the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis.",2020-12,2023-03-16 15:38:08,2023-03-16 15:38:08,1678204804.0,,,,,,,,,,,,University of East Anglia,,en,,doctoral,,,ueaeprints.uea.ac.uk,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,7647,1,221,600

Chapter 4 investigates monetary policy transmission by employing bank balance sheet (loans, deposits and securities) and main macroeconomic variables (exchange rates, stock market index, output and consumer price index). Furthermore, the chapter investigates empirically, using V AR systems, the existence of each channel in the changing financial environment are evaluated for aggregate data (all banks) and disaggregate data across five groups of banks (foreign banks, private banks, mixed banks, regional banks and state banks) by investigating their impulse responses, variance decompositions and accumulated effects. Our observation covers the period of January 1980 to December 2001. In order to capture the effect of financial deregulation which assumed to bring innovations in monetary policy and the effect of 1997 financial crisis, we divide the whole period into three sub period: Period 1 (1980:01-1988:12) in which captures the first 1983 financial deregulation; Period 2 (1988:01-1996:12) in which covers the second big 1988 financial deregulation; and Period 3 (1997:01-2001:12) which include the 1997 financial crisis. In Chapter 5, we examine the role of Non Performing Loans (NPL) in Indonesian monetary transmission mechanism following the methodology employed in Chapter 4. In general, the results, both in Chapter 4 and 5, indicate that monetary policy contraction is not effective in the short run (three months); In the long run (60 months), money is super-neutral as proposed by Friedman (classical view) for the whole observation; while the results across three periods indicates various results in the short-run. Based on the results in Chapter 4 and 5, we investigate further the way Indonesian monetary transmission operates by examining bank portfolio behaviour across five groups of banks (foreign, mixed, private, regional and state banks) in Chapter 6. This chapter focuses on the effect of monetary policy, third party funds and NPL in affecting Indonesian banks behaviour toward loans and other liquidity assets, such as Certificate Bank Indonesia (SBI) and inter bank call money for impact, interim and total effects. We employ a dynamic mean-variance expected utility approach that enables us to calculate the multiplier responses of the choice items to unit changes in exogenous variables. The multiplier effects involve three kinds effects: impact (current), interim (ensuing periods) and total (cumulative) multipliers. The econometric technique employed in the estimation of this chapter is Full Information Maximum Likelihood (FIML). The findings confirm that monetary policy has the greatest impact effects on the banks' portfolios. In regard to the interim effects, all three factors affect those portfolios. In the long run, however, the variable NPL has the greatest influence. Consequently, it can be suggested that Bank Indonesia has to set prudential regulations on, and introduce some stringent supervision of, the banks to reduce the hindrance to the transmission of its monetary policy.",2005,2023-03-16 15:50:05,2023-03-16 15:50:05,1678548425.0,,,,,,,Monetary policy transmission mechanism and bank portfolio behaviour,,,,,University of Birmingham,,eng,,Ph.D.,,,ethos.bl.uk,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,11010,1,221,601

For the euro area, we find a regime which is correlated to the business cycle and which captures periods of very low real credit growth at the end of recessions. However, during this regime credit markets and asset price markets do not impede economic recovery. In the other regime, we do find a procyclical effect of credit and asset price shocks on GDP. Shocks in both variables explain each about 20% of GDP's forecast error variance after four years. Credit shocks have a positive effect on inflation and explain about 35% of the forecast error variance, which confirms that credit aggregates contain information about the monetary stance. The effect of asset price shocks on inflation is insignificant and their share in explaining the forecast error variance negligible. For the US, regime 1 captures periods of stable GDP growth, and low and stable inflation, combined with accelerating asset prices. We find procyclical effects of credit and asset price shocks on GDP only in regime 2. Shocks in both variables explain about the same share (20%) of GDP forecast error variance, whereby the share explained by asset price shocks is about two and a half times larger than in regime 1. Shocks to credit and asset prices have no significant effect on CPI and explain each about 10% of its forecast error variance in both regimes.

Through its monetary policy tools the Government of Kenya is able to control the levels of inflation reported in Kenya. The Central Bank of Kenya (CBK), like most other central banks around the world, is entrusted with the responsibility of formulating and implementing monetary policy directed at achieving and maintaining low inflation as one of its two principal objectives; the other being to maintain a sound market-based financial system. This study set to establish the effectiveness of monetary policy tools in countering inflation in Kenya.  The study employed correlational research design. The study used time series empirical data on the variables to describe and examine the effectiveness of monetary policy tools in countering inflation in Kenya by establishing correlation coefficients between the inflation and the monetary policy tools. The study used secondary data on the Consumer Price Index for inflation, 91-day Treasury bill rate, exchange rate, money supply (M3) and repo rate. The analyses entailed the computation of the various coefficients of correlation denoted as in the model to determine the effectiveness of monetary policy tools in countering inflation in Kenya. The study established that inflation and the money supply were positively correlate with each other. As money supply circulating around the economy increases inflation also increases. An increase in money supply leads to people spending the excess of their money supply over money demand. The study also established that exchange rate policyhas an important role in reducing or minimizing the risk of fluctuations in exchange rates, which will have an impact on the economy. Any changes in exchange rates will have a great impact on the economy. The study recommends that the policy makers need to keenly consider the levels of money supply in Kenya so as to ensure a stable retail price levels. The study also recommends that the Government evaluate the prevailing levels of retail prices and set the interest rates on the 91-day Treasury bills because they are majorly treated as risk free rate hence determine other interest rates and inflation levels in Kenya.",2012,2023-03-16 15:49:41,2023-03-16 15:49:41,1678492800.0,,,,,,,,,,,,"University of Nairobi, Kenya",,en_US,,Thesis,,,erepository.uonbi.ac.ke,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,10866,1,111,614

As a first step in the analysis, the paper analyzes the issue of inflation convergence and the monetary independence in the context of the existing exchange rate peg and the capital flow policy of Nepal. The paper employs a number of macro indicators, and alternative empirical strategies based on the peculiarities of Nepal. The results show that the existing exchange rate peg has resulted in the convergence of the Nepalese price level to the Indian price level in the long-run. Despite the peg, there is an evidence of the independence of the Nepalese monetary policy to a large extent. The narrative approach of identifying monetary policy shows the evidence of the bank lending channel, interest rate channel, and the asset price channel of the Nepalese monetary policy though there exists a lag in monetary policy transmission due to high information asymmetry, adjustment costs and the poor financial infrastructure. In addition, the SVAR approach provides the evidence of the monetary policy transmission, in which the effect of the expansionary monetary policy on the gross domestic product decays to zero at about 8 quarters. Moreover, the paper also shows that the money market liquidity is largely guided by the remittance inflows in recent years.

This complex process is known as the monetary transmission mechanism and the transmission process of monetary impulses changes over time. The strength of this impact is a staple subject of economic research.Research purpose: The aim of the article is to assess the effectiveness of the Federal Reserve System’s monetary policy transmission mechanism over the period 1962–2018. In particular, the scale and timing of the interest rate pass-through to economic activity have been examined.Methods: Econometric methods (the vector autoregression model) have been used. The empirical analysis was carried out based on U.S. economic statistics for the years 1962–2018, which were taken from the FRED and BEA Databases.1Conclusions: Empirical findings reveal that the way in which the Federal Reserve System’s monetary policy influenced the U.S. economy was diversified at particular time intervals. The results imply that the effectiveness of the U.S. central bank’s interest rate policy has been decreasing since the mid-1980s. Firstly, in the period 1962–1983, the real GDP growth rate and the inflation rate were more sensitive to changes in the federal funds rate than in the period 1984–2018. Secondly, in the period 1962–1983, the effective federal funds rate had an almost threefold greater impact on economic activity and price processes. Thirdly, until the mid-1980s, the effects of monetary impulses were felt longer in the American economy than in the later period. What is more, there is no evidence to suggest that the period of historically low interest rates caused a decline in the effectiveness of the transmission of monetary policy impulses.",2020,2023-03-16 15:33:37,2023-03-16 15:33:37,1677110400.0,163-182,,117,,,,,,,,,,,English,,,,,www.ceeol.com,,,,,,Archeology; Balkan journals; CEE books; CEE periodicals; Central and Eastern European documents; Central European Articles; Cultural Journal; Download Central and Eastern European Journals; East European Culture; East European Journals; Eastern European; ebooks; Feminism; History of Culture; Humanities; Law; Philology; Philosophy; Political Science; Psychology; Religion; Social Sciences; Sociology; Theology,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,6526,1,111,620

The findings of this study showed that in the period under review, the exchange rate had a negative and significant effect on economic growth, which has become stronger with the introduction of sanctions in the model. Similar results were obtained for the bank credit variable, with the difference that bank credit has had a positive and significant effect on economic growth, strengthened by the sanctions index in the model. Other results also showed that interest rates had not had a significant effect on economic growth.",2021-01-01,2023-03-16 15:36:34,2023-03-16 15:36:34,1677607449.0,1719-1730,,Special Issue,12,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,ijnaa.semnan.ac.ir,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,7289,1,221,623

I estimate these effects under weaker assumptions. Specifically, I estimate a structural vector autoregression identified using a variety of sign restrictions, including restrictions on impulse responses to a monetary policy shock, the monetary policy reaction function, and the relationship between the monetary policy shock and a proxy for this shock. I use an approach to Bayesian inference that accounts for the problem of posterior sensitivity to the choice of prior that arises in this setting, which turns out to be important. Some sets of identifying restrictions are not particularly informative about the effects of monetary policy. However, combining the restrictions allows us to draw some useful inferences. There is robust evidence that an increase in the cash rate lowers output and consumer prices at horizons beyond a year or so. The results are consistent with the macroeconomic effects of a 100 basis point increase in the cash rate lying towards the upper end of the range of existing estimates.",2023-01-03,2023-03-16 15:50:03,2023-03-16 15:50:03,1678548266.0,,,,,,,,,,,,Reserve Bank of Australia,,en,,RBA Research Discussion Papers,,,DOI.org (Crossref),,,,,https://www.rba.gov.au/publications/rdp/2022/pdf/rdp2022-09.pdf,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,10987,1,221,626

In the first approach, we jointly estimate a model of inflation, survey expectations and monetary policy, where each is a function of a common time-varying inflation trend. In the estimates, long-term expectations track closely the unobserved trend that is an important factor in inflation dynamics, implying that changes in long-run expectations can lead to persistent movements in inflation. In the second approach, we estimate a time-varying parameter VAR with stochastic volatility. This model relaxes the cross-equation and constant parameter restrictions from the first model. Impulse response analysis shows a relatively stable relationship between inflation and survey measures of inflation, although with some modest changes consistent with improved anchoring of long-term expectations. Finally, we rely on a conventional VAR framework incorporating several macroeconomic variables, including both short- and long-term measures of expected inflation. In these estimates, shocks to either measure of expectations lead to a rise in the other measure and some limited pass-through to inflation. Shocks to inflation cause both short- and long-term expectations to rise.

Linear regression have been exploited to analyze the impact of both monetary and non-monetary factors on gross domestic product dynamics of Poland, Check Republic, Slovakia and Hungary. The study have revealed that both monetary and non-monetary factors have impact on GDP dynamics of the Visegrad Group countries, but household final consumption, exports of goods and services, inflation, high-technology exports and broad money growth show the highest correlation with GDP of the countries. All regression models consider GDP dynamics as dependent variable. Collinearity of certain predictor variables have not allowed using the most significant factors to develop linear regression models. As a result, independent variables sets are not those of the highest statistical significance. Therefore, regression model of Poland includes inflation, high-technology exports and real interest rate as predictor variables. Regression model of Check Republic shows the correlation between GDP dynamics as dependent variable and high technology exports, domestic credit provided by financial sector and broad money growth as independent ones. The following independent variables are used to develop the regression line of Slovakia: domestic credit provided by financial sector and broad money growth.

The paper's principal aim is to provide stylised facts about the sectoral responses to unexpected changes in monetary policy and to help assess how monetary policy developments feed through the economy. It also provides indirect evidence about the underlying nature of the transmission mechanism. The first set of results relates to the largest industrial sectors - construction, services, production industries (including utilities and manufacturing) - which sum together to form the output measure of GDP. Thereafter the paper focuses on the manufacturing sector alone. Data sources for manufacturing are richer than for other sectors of the economy, which allows a more detailed analysis of the factors that might account for the pattern of responses to monetary shocks which we observe across manufacturing. Focusing first on the main industrial sectors, the paper finds that the effects of an unanticipated monetary policy tightening seem to be unevenly distributed across sectors of the economy. As might be expected, sectors such as construction show a sizeable and rapid decline in output, whereas others, like services, show a much more muted reaction. Manufacturing as a whole also responds quite sharply to a monetary tightening, but some large industrial sectors, notably the utilities, show a subdued reaction. Turning finally to the manufacturing sector alone, the paper shows that the (2 digit SIC) sectors that comprise manufacturing also exhibit diverse responses to a monetary shock. The paper shows the pattern of manufacturing sector responses seems correlated with the size characteristics of the firms in each sector. In particular, sectors which mainly comprise ""small"" firms tend to exhibit a stronger reaction to monetary shocks than sectors that mainly comprise ""larger"" firms. This might indicate that credit market imperfections play a role in the monetary policy transmission process.",1997-09-01,2023-03-16 15:45:26,2023-03-16 15:45:26,1678406400.0,,,,,,,The Industrial Impact of Monetary Policy Shocks,,,,,,,en,,,,,Social Science Research Network,,"Place: Rochester, NY",,,,SSRN; Chris Salmon; Joe Ganley; The Industrial Impact of Monetary Policy Shocks: Some Stylised Facts,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,9572,1,221,639

The testing is applied using the Johansen procedure based on a factor-augmented vector error correction model (FAVEC model), which is augmented by the factor of the macroeconomic environment, for the period from January 2003 to December 2010. Factor analysis is used to estimate the macroeconomic environment factor, which reflects developments in domestic economic activity based on a large number of time series. The monetary policy indicator, which adequately represents the complexity of the CNB measures, is also defined. The paper confirms the existence of a long-run relation between household loans, the macroeconomic environment factor and the monetary policy indicator. At the same time, no such a relation was confirmed for corporate loans. This is probably due to the fact that, in contrast to households, enterprises raised substantial funds from other financing sources (particularly abroad) in preceding years, and not only from commercial banks. This has limited the impact of monetary policy on corporate loans. Impulse response functions estimated on the basis of the FAVEC model showed that a restrictive monetary policy shock leads to a decrease in household loans, while a positive shock in the macroeconomic environment factor, which generally represents an increase in overall economic activity, has a favourable impact on bank loans to households. The identification of the long-run relation yields the conclusion that CNB measures were justified; without them credit growth would certainly have been larger, which means that external imbalances in the Croatian economy would have been worse. On the other hand, the recent crisis and the halt in bank lending coupled with the weak credit channel of monetary policy in Croatia limited the impact of incentives for credit growth. This could in future undermine the longrun relation estimated in this paper.",,2023-03-16 15:32:46,2023-03-16 15:32:46,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,en,,,,,Zotero,,,,,https://www.hnb.hr/repec/hnb/wpaper/pdf/w-034.pdf,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,6382,1,222,646

Hence, the main aim of this paper is to evaluate the relationship among these variables by applying dynamic panel data approach for 23 private and governmental banks during the 2008-2019. Method: For achieving this purpose, at first the inflationary environments have been extracted by Markov- Switching and then, by utilizing dynamic panel data and GMM estimator the short-run relationship between variables have been tested. Results: The empirical findings of this paper indicated that the first order lag of bank deposits has a positive and significant effect on the volume of deposits in current year and its amount is equal to 0.17. Also, the variable of the interaction of liquidity growth rate with severe inflation environments and banks 'legal reserve ratio has a negative and significant effect on private banks' deposit volume and the variables of long-term deposit interest rate, real GDP growth rate and liquidity quality have a positive and significant effect on deposit volume. State-owned banks are positive and meaningful, consistent with theoretical expectations. The deposit profit rate has positive and other monetary policy variables such as liquidity growth rate and rule of deposits ratio and cross effect of liquidity money growth with inflationary environment have negative impact on the total deposits of Banks. Regarding the negative and significant effect of the interaction of liquidity growth rate with high inflation environments, it can be argued that with increasing liquidity and increasing demand, the general level of prices increases and consequently inflation rate increases and the economy enters a severe inflation environment, so expect as inflation intensifies, demand for deposits in banks will decrease and the incentive to invest in alternative environments such as the foreign exchange market, gold and other assets will increase. In addition, the value of Sargan test statistics indicates that the null hypothesis is not rejected and the instrumental variables defined in the model are valid. Because the value of this test statistic shows that the instrument variables defined are not correlated with the error terms. It is worth noting that in this estimate, due to the shorter period of time under study, the second-order interval of the volume of deposits of private and state-owned banks is considered as an instrument variable. According to the results of Arellano & Bond, it can be inferenced that the order of self-correlation between the disorder sentences was of the first order. Therefore, this method is a best method to eliminate the fixed effects of the model. Conclusion: Considering the negative and significant effect of the interaction of liquidity growth rate with inflationary environments on the deposit volume of the banking sector, it is suggested that economic policymakers apply contractionary monetary policies to control and decrease the volume of liquidity and control the general level of prices and inflation.

For instance, does a multi sector model in which the frequency of price changes differs among sectors predict radically different dynamics for aggregate variables following a monetary policy shock than a one-sector model in which sectors are assumed to be homogenous in their frequencies of price changes? Is there any relative price effect of the shocks to monetary policy? If there is, can this relative price effect be related to the heterogeneity of the frequency of price changes among sectors? What insights can be gained if dynamic stochastic open-economy models are elaborated by including the heterogeneity of price flexibility among sectors? These questions are among the types of the questions that I address in this thesis. This thesis consists of three papers. The first paper studies the effects of a monetary policy shock on output, inflation and the real-wage in the United States. Next, the dynamics of these aggregate variables as predicted by the one- and multi-sector dynamic stochastic general equilibrium (DSGE) models are compared. The main finding is that the dynamics as predicted by the multi-sector model are quite similar to those as predicted by the one-sector model. The second paper focuses mostly on the effects of shocks to the federal funds rate on disaggregated sectors' prices in the United States. The two main empirical findings in this chapter are the substantial heterogeneity in sectoral price responses to the shock and that the price responses in sectors are only weakly associated with their frequency of price changes. The third paper, jointly written with Emek Karaca, is concerned with the effects of positive monetary shocks on output, the real exchange rate and the price level in developing countries which have adopted an inflation targeting regime. We find that such shocks are associated with a temporary rise in output; a temporary depreciation in the real exchange rate and a sizable contemporaneous increase in the price level in those economies.",2014-05,2023-02-13 13:36:55,2023-02-13 13:36:55,,,,,,,,,,,,,University of British Columbia,,,,,eoh,,EBSCOhost,,,,,,"Foreign Exchange F31; Macroeconomics: Production E23; Monetary Policy E52; Industrial Organization and Macroeconomics: Industrial Structure and Structural Change; Industrial Price Indices L16; Production, Pricing, and Market Structure; Size Distribution of Firms L11",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,3829,1,221,655

A theoretical model of an open economy is used to identify a structural VAR model. The empirical results from the identified VAR model are compared with two less structural approaches for identification of monetary policy shocks. The first assumes that shocks can be measured as deviations from a forward looking interest rate rule, estimated using Sveriges Riksbank's (Swedish central bank) own forecasts. The second approach focuses on the effects of narrative monetary policy shocks as given by devaluations of the Swedish currency. We find that plausible theoretical restrictions often result in price puzzles. Although conventional results obtain with certain theoretical restrictions imposed on the VAR, another way to achieve this is by using external information about large policy shocks.

Our identifying assumption is that unexpected changes in interest rates in a 30-minute window surrounding scheduled Federal Reserve announcements arise from news about monetary policy. In response to an interest rate hike, nominal and real interest rates increase roughly one-for-one, several years out into the term structure, while the response of expected inflation is small.

We consider VAR systems for the G-7 countries and find that, while positive innovations in U.S. interest rates lead to an impact appreciation of the U.S. dollar, positive innovations in the interest rates of the other G-7 countries are associated with an impact depreciation of their currency. We offer two explanations of this ""exchange rate puzzle""; one is based on the idea that the U.S. is the ""leader"" country in the setting of monetary policy for the G-7 area, while the other countries are ""followers"". The other explanation suggests endogenous policy reaction to underlying inflationary shocks that are a cause of exchange rate depreciation. We then offer some empirical evidence consistent with these two interpretations of the exchange rate puzzle: after controlling for U.S. monetary policies and expected inflation, the response of exchange rates to postive interest rate shocks is a persistent currency appreciation in most of the G-7 countries. Moreover, consistently with both overshooting and liquidity models, a monetary contraction is associated with a transitory appreciation of the real exchange rate and a temporary fall in output.",1995,2023-02-13 13:34:58,2023-02-13 13:34:58,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,eoh,Availability Note: Information provided in collaboration with the RePEc Project: http://repec.org,EBSCOhost,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1088,1,221,669

While, innovations on the price-based nominal anchors (MRR and REER) have neutral and fleeting effects on output.

In this paper we examine the exchange rate channel in the MTM in Germany by estimating an identified VAR model. Two features of the results are highlighted. The effect of a policy shock on the exchange rate accelerates the pass-through of policy into prices and leads to a different response of the various components of GDP. We then show that these qualitative effects can be duplicated in a general equilibrium model for a semi-small open economy with sticky prices and wages that is calibrated to capture the main features of the German economy.",1999-12,2023-02-13 13:36:07,2023-02-13 13:36:07,,489-521,,4,147,,De Economist,,,,,,,,,,,eoh,,EBSCOhost,,,,,,Foreign Exchange F31; International Policy Coordination and Transmission F42,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2748,1,222,676

Because of the new economic and monetary conditions, the effectiveness of conventional monetary tools has been questioned. Purpose of the article: Designed models examine the consequences of unconventional monetary policy for macroeconomic variables, monetary variables and interest rates in the euro area. Particular attention is paid to the response of the price level, represented by HICP, to various monetary policy innovations. Except a shock in credit multiplier and asset purchase programme (APP), also the effectiveness of a conventional monetary tool, such as main refinancing operation (MRO) interest rate, is inspected. Methods: Use has been made of impulse responses from structural VAR models to analyze a large sample that covers the time horizon of 1999 to 2016. Several econometric tests are performed to provide a profound analysis. The conclusions from baseline models are verified in multiple robustness check models, which are specified under alternative conditions. Findings and Value added: It has been found that, in the aftermath of the Global Financial Crisis, conventional monetary instruments are effective in the short-run. In the long-run, unconventional monetary policy has a greater potential to stabilize the economy than the traditional interest rate transmission channel.

The main assumption in this model is that the dynamics of a large set of macro variables are captured by some observed and unobserved common factors. The unobserved factors are extracted from a large set of macroeconomic data. The key advantage of using this model is that it allows extracting the impulse responses of a wide range of macroeconomic variables to structural shocks in the federal funds rate. Findings: The results indicate that industries exhibit differential responses to an unanticipated monetary policy tightening. In general, manufacturing industries appear to be more sensitive compared to mining, and utility industries and durable manufacturing industries are found to be more sensitive than those within nondurable and other manufacturing industries to a monetary policy shock.

We pin down key parameters of the model by matching impulse responses obtained from a vector autoregression on time series for the US relative to the euro area. Our estimation procedure yields plausible parameter values and suggests a strong role for strategic complementarities. Counterfactual simulations show that openness alters monetary transmission significantly.

Credit flows and the instability of credit appear to be at the root of the financial instability problem. On the other hand, some authors recently questioned whether a too early and too strong leaning against the wind policy by central banks might have higher costs than benefits in terms of output and employment losses. In our paper, we include in an inflation targeting model a financial stabilization goal. In contrast to infinite horizon and two-period models, we propose a finite horizon model. The model is solved by using a new global solution algorithm, called Nonlinear Model Predictive Control (NMPC), exploring stabilizing/destabilizing effects of price and nonprice (credit volume) drivers of the output gap, inflation, and credit flows. We substantiate the theoretical part of the paper by approaching the subject empirically, relying to that end on a regime-switching structural vector autoregressive (VAR) for the euro area. The empirical model contains standard macroeconomic variables along with credit flows and loan interest rates, the central bank policy rate, and European Central Bank (ECB) balance sheet variables. The regime-switching feature of the model is meant to capture the state-dependent relationship between the variables, with specific nonlinearities having direct counterparts in the theoretical model. Based on a sign restriction methodology, we explore conventional and unconventional monetary policy shocks, loan supply, and demand shocks, under different regime assumptions to reveal the state-dependent effects of both interest rate and volume-based policies.

The paper shows that the estimated demand-side effects of monetary policy dominate the estimated supply side effect, even if restrictions are imposed that make occurrence of a positive inflation response to a monetary contraction more likely.",2007-03-01,2023-03-16 15:45:31,2023-03-16 15:45:31,1678406400.0,906-937,,3,31,,Journal of Economic Dynamics and Control,Does inflation increase after a monetary policy tightening?,,,,,,,en,,,,,ScienceDirect,,,,,,Price puzzle; Bayesian methods; New keynesian models; United states,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,9643,1,221,695

I estimate a parsimonious recursive VAR in order to identify monetary policy shocks in the euro area. Its predictions as to the responses of the main economic aggregates are in line both with existing literature and with theoretical priors on the effects a monetary policy shock should produce, without suffering from the empirical puzzles that can be found in some previous works. The benchmark model is then extended to include the flow-of-funds variables. I find evidence of a certain degree of inertia in firms’ behaviour. In fact, following a policy tightening firms increase net funds raised at impact. Households adjust their financial investment and borrowing attitude quite rapidly after the shock, reducing the overall accumulation of financial assets and switching from deposits and mutual fund shares to short-term securities. Special attention is devoted to the impact of a policy tightening on loans to the private sector. As in previous studies on the euro-area economy, we find that an interest-rate hike is followed by an increase in loans granted to households and firms in the short run.

Indeed, sticky prices are a common micro-foundation in models of monetary policy and nominal aggregate fluctuations, as monetary variables typically do not have real economic effects if prices are fully flexible. This is why price stickiness has been the focus of much research, both theoretical and empirical. A particularly exciting development in this literature has been the recent availability of large, detailed, micro data sets of individual prices, which allow us to observe when and how often the prices of individual goods and services change. This type of data has greatly improved our ability to discipline the theoretical models that are used to analyze monetary policy, and advances in sticky price modelling have also provided important questions to ask of the data. The most common data set used in this literature has been the micro data underlying the U.S. Consumer Price Index. While work with this data has produced important results, an important limitation is that it has, until recently, only been available going back to 1988. This is a limitation because it means that the data set only cover periods of low and stable inflation, which limits the types of questions that the price data can help answer. In this dissertation, I present an extension to this data set: in work carried out with Emi Nakamura, Jon Steinsson and Patrick Sun, we re-constructed an older portion of the data to extend it back to 1977. With this new sample, we can study the high inflation periods of the late 1970's and early 1980's, and in this dissertation I explore various questions related to monetary policy, and show that several important insights can be gained from this new data set. Chapter 1, ""The Elusive Costs of Inflation: Price Dispersion during the U.S. Great Inflation"", presents the extended CPI data set and addresses a key policy question: How high an inflation rate should central banks target? This depends crucially on the costs of inflation. An important concern is that high inflation will lead to inefficient price dispersion. Workhorse New Keynesian models imply that this cost of inflation is very large. An increase in steady state inflation from 0% to 10% yields a welfare loss that is an order of magnitude greater than the welfare loss from business cycle fluctuations in output in these models. We assess this prediction empirically using a new dataset on price behavior during the Great Inflation of the late 1970's and early 1980's in the United States. If price dispersion increases rapidly with inflation, we should see the absolute size of price changes increasing with inflation: price changes should become larger as prices drift further from their optimal level at higher inflation rates. We find no evidence that the absolute size of price changes rose during the Great Inflation. This suggests that the standard New Keynesian analysis of the welfare costs of inflation is wrong and its implications for the optimal inflation rate need to be reassessed. We also find that (non-sale) prices have not become more flexible over the past 40 years. Chapter 2, ""The Skewness of the Price Change Distribution: A New Touchstone for Sticky Price Models"", documents the predictions of a broad class of existing price setting models on how various statistics of the price change distribution change with the rate of aggregate inflation. Notably, menu cost models uniformly feature the price change distribution becoming less dispersed and less skewed as inflation rises, while in the Calvo model both relations are positive. Using a novel data set, the micro data underlying the U.S. CPI from the late 1970's onwards, we evaluate these predictions using the large variation in inflation over this period. Price change dispersion does indeed fall with inflation, but skewness does not, meaning that menu cost models are at odds with these empirical patterns. The Calvo model's prediction on price change skewness are consistent with the data, but it fails to match the positive relationship between inflation and the frequency of price change, and the negative relationship between inflation and price change dispersion. Since the negative correlations for dispersion and skewness are driven by the selection effect in menu cost models, the evidence presented suggests that selection is less substantial than in menu cost models. Chapter 3, ""The Selection Effect and Monetary Non-Neutrality in a Random Menu Cost Model"", presents a random menu cost model that nests the Golosov and Lucas (2007) and Calvo (1983) models as extreme cases, as well as intermediate cases, depending on the distribution of menu costs. This model includes idiosyncratic technology shocks and aggregate demand shocks, so it can be applied to price micro data, and to evaluate the degree of monetary non-neutrality implied by different kinds of menu cost distributions. This model can match the empirical patterns presented in Chapter 2. I find that a random menu cost model with a much weaker selection effect (than in existing menu cost models) no longer predicts such a negative relationship between inflation and price change skewness, but still predicts that the frequency of price change rises with inflation, as in the data, and contrary to the Calvo model. This model also predicts a very high degree of monetary non-neutrality, and the results overall provide evidence in favor of high non-neutrality. Chapter 4, ""The State-Dependent Price Adjustment Hazard Function: Evidence from High Inflation Periods"", considers a model-free approach to understanding sticky prices and non-neutrality. The price adjustment hazard function has been used to establish the relationship between individual firms' price setting behavior (micro-level price stickiness) and the response of the aggregate price level to monetary shocks (aggregate stickiness, or monetary non-neutrality), but scant work has been done to estimate the function empirically. We show first that various types of hazard functions (with widely different levels of implied aggregate stickiness) can match the unconditional moments that have been the focus of empirical work on sticky prices (such as the average frequency and size of price changes). However, the relationship between inflation and the shape of the price change distribution over time provides considerable information on the shape of the hazard function. In particular, we find that in order to match the positive inflation-frequency correlation, and the non-negative inflation-price change skewness correlations, the hazard function has to be asymmetric around zero (price increases are overall more likely than decreases) and relatively flat for small to intermediate values of the desired price gap. The latter feature means that our estimated hazard function implies a large degree of aggregate flexibility.",2016-05,2023-02-13 13:35:44,2023-02-13 13:35:44,,,,,,,,,,,,,Columbia University,,,,,eoh,,EBSCOhost,,,,,,Inflation; Deflation E31; Monetary Policy E52; Price Level; General Aggregative Models: Keynes; Keynesian; Post-Keynesian E12,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2198,1,222,698

Taken as a whole, the empirical evidence suggests that monetary expansions are basically accommodated through a higher price level, rather than a higher economic activity. In the short run, real exchange rate depreciations produce a moderate effect on inflation and an insignificant effect on output. In the long run, however, an undervalued currency results in production losses. In addition, we find that i) both inertial inflation and inflationary expectations are among the driving forces of price instability, and ii) shocks to nominal wages are recessionary at impact and this negative effect is persistent over time. Lastly, nominal wages are a positive function of capacity utilization and the expected rate of inflation, thereby suggesting a forward-looking wage adjustment process.

In Europe, much of the interest in the effects of monetary policy is arguably a reflection of the introduction of the single currency: to the extent that transmission mechanism differ significantly across euro area countries, heterogenous responses of economic activity and prices to the policy instrument should be expected, an occurrence whose policy implications are of major relevance. To gain some insight into the likely causes of those differences recent studies have attempted to identify and assess separately the channels of transmission of monetary policy. This paper proposes a simple methodology to quantify separately the different parts of the overall impulse response that are transmitted through the various mechanisms at play in a model of the economy. It is shown that, under the maintained assumption of linearity, the decomposition of the effects of monetary policy into a number of channels delivered by our approach is exact (i.e., it leaves no unexplained residual). This conclusion holds regardless of the nature of the expectation formation mechanism and the way in which policy decisions are modelled. The features of the proposed approach are illustrated with an empirical application, using a model that features two distinct transmission channels and assumes rational expectations and a monetary policy reaction rule. We show that our approach produces an exact decomposition of the effects of a monetary policy shock.

Hence, a general AB model of (Amisano and Giannini, 1997) identification scheme, which is not recursive, is employed in this study. Findings The author shows that monetary tightening leads to a fall in real economic activity and depreciates the exchange rate. And in regard to the fiscal policy, the author calculates an initial government spending multiplier of 0.20, which later peaks at 0.40. The tax multiplier is almost 0 on impact and statistically insignificant. However, the author finds evidence supporting the existence of accommodative stance between monetary policy and fiscal policy, which is important for economic and political decision-making. Originality/value Empirical studies that deal with the joint effects of monetary and fiscal policy for South Africa through the SVAR framework are quite limited. This paper, therefore, contributes to the empirical literature on the effects of monetary and fiscal policy in a small open economy like South Africa.",2020-01-01,2023-03-16 15:46:02,2023-03-16 15:46:02,1678446218.0,625-638,,4,11,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Emerald Insight,,,,,,Monetary policy; Small open economy; Fiscal policy; Structural vector autoregressive,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,9809,1,221,710

It is based exclusively on known past policy shocks, which are uncovered from high-frequency data, and does not rely on any theoretical a-priori restrictions. Our empirical analysis for the euro area reveals that interest rate decisions of the ECB surprised financial markets at least fifteen times since 1999. This information is used to restrict the sign and magnitude of the structural residuals of the policy rule equation at these shock dates accordingly. In spite of its utmost agnostic nature, this approach achieves strong identification, suggesting that unexpected ECB decisions have an immediate impact on the short-term money market rate, the narrow money stock, commodity prices, consumer prices and the Euro-Dollar exchange rate, and that real output responds gradually. Our close to assumption-free approach obtains as an outcome what traditional sign restrictions on impulse responses impose as an assumption.",2020,2023-02-13 13:36:15,2023-02-13 13:36:15,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,eoh,Availability Note: Information provided in collaboration with the RePEc Project: http://repec.org,EBSCOhost,,,,,,Growth; Monetary Policy E52; Diffusion Processes; Dynamic Quantile Regressions; Dynamic Treatment Effect Models; Multiple or Simultaneous Equation Models: Time-Series Models; State Space Models C32; Economic History: Macroeconomics and Monetary Economics; Industrial Structure; Fluctuations: Europe: 1913- N14,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2925,1,111,711

The effect of monetary policy on unemployment rate and industrial production is estimated to be strong and statistically significant using the data from January 1999 to July 2017 or from the pre-crisis period. However, after the beginning of the crisis the responses weaken drastically and become sometimes statistically insignificant, indicating that the effect of the ECB’s conventional monetary policy became weaker after the financial crisis. This finding is extremely interesting because one could presume either weaker or stronger effect based on economic theory.

We argue that this inconclusiveness is likely to be due to the fact that existing empirical studies concentrate on the effects of particular developments on specific transmission channels. Such analyses typically require strong assumptions. Moreover, specific changes could have off-setting effects regarding the overall effectiveness of monetary policy. In order to shed light on this issue, we investigate whether there has been a significant change in the overall transmission of monetary policy to inflation and output by estimating a standard Vector Autoregression (VAR) for the euro area and by endogenously searching for possible break dates. We find a significant break point around 1996 and some evidence for a second one around 1999. We compare the effects of monetary policy shocks for these episodes and find that the well-known 'stylized facts' of monetary policy transmission remain valid. Therefore, we argue that the general guiding principles of the Eurosystem monetary policy remain adequate. Moreover, it seems that monetary transmission after 1998 is not very different from before 1996, but probably very different compared to the interim period.",2011,2023-02-13 13:34:44,2023-02-13 13:34:44,,131-145,,Query date: 2023-02-09 16:27:49,21,,Applied Financial Economics,,,,,,,,,,,eoh,,EBSCOhost,,,,,,Monetary Policy E52; International Monetary Arrangements and Institutions F33; International Policy Coordination and Transmission F42,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,773,1,221,717

I employ a vector autoregression (VAR) identified with sign and zero restrictions to simulate a monetary policy shock implemented by the Federal Reserve consistent with the economic theory suggesting unconventional monetary policy measures. I find that banks respond to expansionary monetary policy shocks by taking additional risk through lowering lending standards, however banks still experience a compression in lending margins, indicating little success in their efforts to stabilize reductions in profits. I also include a number of counterfactual interest rates to allow Fed policy rates to reflect negative interest rate policies to compare monetary policy shocks across the conventional and unconventional monetary policy regimes in a consistent manner. I find that banks take less risk in the unconventional monetary policy regime relative to the conventional regime, however they experience a larger reduction in lending margins relative to the pre-Financial Crisis period. Use of a forecast error variance decomposition indicates the risk channel played a larger role in the post-Financial Crisis period, carrying implications for Fed policy in considering this particular transmission mechanism in unconventional monetary policy measures. The second chapter of this dissertation addresses the foreign central bank responses of 12 advanced economies and 12 emerging market economies to United States unconventional monetary policy shocks identified by a combination of sign and zero restrictions in a global vector autoregression (GVAR) framework. I find foreign central banks follow in kind with United States unconventional monetary policy measures, such as Quantitative Easing, in order to offset undesirable spillover effects. My results also indicate that United States Quantitative Easing plays a more substantial role in determining monetary easing conditions in emerging markets than in advanced economies. Additionally, I find foreign central banks with inflation targeting or floating exchange rate policies tend to follow a United States Quantitative Easing shock with more stable monetary policy responses, with larger increases in output than non-inflation targeting or managed exchange rate regimes. My results are robust to various changes in the specifications and identifying restrictions. The third chapter was written with Dr. Robert F. Tamura. We introduce a novel data set to empirically test a dynamic, dynastic human capital model developed by Tamura, Simon, and Murphy (2016), yielding predictions of the relative efficiency of school for black and white students during the Jim Crow era. By providing measures developed within the data set, we can test the parametrizations of key variables with respect to access to education calibrated within the model. Our results suggest that the model accurately describes the key educational values generated by the model, and confirms the results of the theoretical framework developed by Tamura, Simon, and Murphy (2016) in that blacks faced substantially higher marginal costs of education relative to whites as a result of the lack of equal per-pupil expenditures allocated at the state level during segregation, lower levels of human capital accumulation of African American parents relative to white parents, and the disparity of income across both races. This paper contributes to the literature by presenting a novel data set regarding expenditures per pupil for white and African American students for the years 1890-1960, and also confirming the fit of the model developed by Tamura, Simon, and Murphy (2016).",2020-05,2023-02-13 13:34:43,2023-02-13 13:34:43,,,,,,,,,,,,,Clemson University,,,,,eoh,,EBSCOhost,,,,,,"Monetary Policy E52; Financial Crises G01; Human Capital; Labor Productivity J24; Occupational Choice; Skills; Economics of Minorities, Races, Indigenous Peoples, and Immigrants; Non-labor Discrimination J15; Banks; Depository Institutions; Micro Finance Institutions; Mortgages G21; Analysis of Education I21",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,752,1,122,720

The effects of monetary policy on lending activity are fairly limited, although there is some evidence that it affects lending rates more than loan volumes. Monetary policy shocks have strong effects on inflation, while the central bank reacts strongly to adverse shocks hitting the economy. Baseline results are confirmed by several robustness checks. According to historical decomposition, the lending activity was supporting economic growth before and during the crisis, but its contribution became negative during the recovery and it was a drag on growth until the end of the period. Pre-crisis GDP growth is mostly explained by supportive monetary policy. However, the restrictive monetary policy during the crisis contributed to the fall of GDP, before becoming supportive again during the early stages of the recovery.

The criterion used to examine inflation performance is the degree of inflation persistence. Three alternative definitions of inflation persistence are used to model inflation dynamics. First, autocorrelation properties of inflation process are examined. Estimates of traditional Phillips curve and the hybrid-new Keynesian Phillips curve (H-NKPC) suggest a significant upward shift in inflation persistence following the change in exchange rate system in late 1977. Recursive estimates of coefficient on lagged inflation and Chow parameter stability tests confirm these results. Second, inflation response to systematic monetary policy actions is examined. Results suggest that inflation is more persistent and monetary policy is more accommodative in the flexible exchange rate regime. However, the correlation between money growth and inflation is found to be modest. Finally, inflation response to non-systemic policy actions (i.e., policy shocks) is examined through impulse response functions of an unrestricted VAR system. Results suggest that policy shocks are more persistent in the flexible exchange rate regime, than in the fixed exchange rate regime. However, maximum lag length of inflation response to a policy shock is not significantly different across regimes, suggesting that results from the impulse response analysis are inconclusive. Overall, there is substantial evidence to suggest that the shift in inflation persistence coincides with the change in exchange rate regimes. Moreover, during the flexible regime, higher monetary accommodation has resulted in higher inflation persistence. Because of sluggish response of inflation to changes in monetary policy measures, more stringent monetary policy measures may be needed to curb inflationary pressures.",2009-10-15,2023-03-16 15:45:11,2023-03-16 15:45:11,1678378206.0,69,,1,37,,Staff Studies,Monetary Policy and Inflation Performance,,,,,,,en,,,,,DOI.org (Crossref),,,,,https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/document?repid=rep1&type=pdf&doi=510c6c661cde234e5eabfd35f5427e1305d84e91,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,9485,1,221,726

The IS equation includes a real exchange rate variable and a country-specific foreign output variable to capture direct inter-country linkages. In accord with the theory all variables are measured as deviations from their steady states, which are estimated as long-horizon forecasts from a reduced-form cointegrating global vector autoregression. The resulting rational expectations model is then estimated for 33 countries on data for 1980Q1-2006Q4, by inequality constrained IV, using lagged and contemporaneous foreign variables as instruments, subject to the restrictions implied by the NK theory. The multi-country DSGE NK model is then solved to provide estimates of identified supply, demand and monetary policy shocks.

Area-specific shocks are thus more important in EMU than country-specific shocks used to be in the previous states, e.g. in Germany. It is thus not surprising that the models built by the staff of the European Central Bank (ECB) to study optimal monetary policy in the Euro area (for instance Smets and Wouters, 2004a, 2004b) typically assume that this works essentially as a closed economy, hit by domestic shocks--the same assumption made in standard models of U.S. monetary policy (see e.g. Christiano et al., 1999 ), where all shocks are domestic with the only possible exception of energy price shocks. Two-country models exist at the ECB (e.g. de Walque, Smets, Wouters, 2005) but they overlook asset price fluctuations and their international comovements. This paper studies monetary policy in the Euro area looking at the variable most directly related to current and expected monetary policy, the yield on long term government bonds. We explore how the behaviour of European long-term rates has been affected by EMU and whether the response of long-term rates to monetary policy has got any closer to that consistent with a closed economy. We find that the level of long-term rates in Europe is almost entirely explained by U.S. shocks and by the systematic response of U.S. and European variables (inflation, short term rates and the output gap) to these shocks. Our results suggest in particular that U.S. variables are more important than local variables in the policy rule followed by European monetary authorities: this was true for the Bundesbank before EMU and has remained true for the ECB, at least so far. Using closed economy models to analyze monetary policy in the Euro is thus inconsistent with the empirical evidence on the determinants of Euro area long-term rates. It is also inconsistent with the way the Governing Council of the ECB appears to make actual policy decisions. We also find that Euro area long rates respond more to financial shocks, in particular shocks to term premia, than they do to monetary policy ""shocks""--i.e. instances when the ECB deviates from its rule. This finding point to the importance of incorporating into the analysis of Euro area monetary policy of the effects of fluctuations in international asset prices.",2008,2023-02-13 13:34:55,2023-02-13 13:34:55,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,eoh,Availability Note: Information provided in collaboration with the RePEc Project: http://repec.org,EBSCOhost,,,,,,"Interest Rates: Determination, Term Structure, and Effects E43; Monetary Policy E52; Central Banks and Their Policies E58",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1039,1,222,731

As suggested by existing literature, there are four major monetary policy instruments used by the People's Bank of China. They are the seven-day repo rate, the one-year benchmark lending rate, the M2, and the total loan. We run SVARs with the monetary policy instrument, the stock index, and the macroeconomic variables and show the impulse responses of the stock index to the monetary policy shocks. After comparing two restriction schemes, the short-run Cholesky restrictions and the short-run and long-run combined restrictions for identification, we conclude that the latter restriction method leads to better estimation than the former one. In general, a contractionary monetary policy shock lowers the stock price, appreciates the Chinese currency, reduces the output gap, injects deflation, and shrinks the commodity price gap. We find that the benchmark lending rate is more effective in regulating the Chinese stock market than the other monetary policy instruments. In addition, a combination of price-based and quantity-based monetary policy instruments is suggested for impacting the stock market and stabilizing the economy in China.",2020-12,2023-02-13 13:34:31,2023-02-13 13:34:31,,1-33,,4,23,,Review of Pacific Basin Financial Markets and Policies,,,,,,,,,,,eoh,,EBSCOhost,,,,,,"Inflation; Deflation E31; Interest Rates: Determination, Term Structure, and Effects E43; Monetary Policy E52; Price Level; Corporate Finance and Governance O16; Economic Development: Financial Markets; Saving and Capital Investment; Inflation P24; Money; Socialist Systems and Transitional Economies: National Income, Product, and Expenditure; Event Studies; Information and Market Efficiency; Insider Trading G14; Socialist Institutions and Their Transitions: Financial Economics P34",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,460,1,111,742

The first chapter investigates the relation between interest rate policy and nominal exchange rate volatility. Using data of countries in currency crisis, I employ a time-varying-transition-probability (TVTP) Markov-switching model to study the interest rate- exchange rate nexus. The second chapter studies the impact of macroeconomic policy by introducing different policy shocks into an equilibrium business cycle model. In particular, monetary policy is modelled as an interest rate rule (Taylor Rule) to investigate liquidity effects and persistence in output and inflation. The third chapter (with Charles M. Engel) revisits the role of heterogeneity and aggregation bias in explaining the purchasing power parity (PPP) puzzle. In Chapter 1 the interest rate-exchange rate nexus and the effectiveness of an interest rate defense are investigated theoretically and empirically. I construct a simple theoretical model by incorporating an interest rate rule in the model proposed by Jeanne and Rose (2002). The model has multiple equilibria, and under plausible conditions, higher exchange rate volatility is associated with higher interest rates. The theoretical model motivates me to adopt a Markov-switching specification of the nominal exchange rate with time-varying transition probabilities. The data of Indonesia, South Korea, the Philippines, Thailand, Mexico, and Turkey indicate that raising nominal interest rates leads to a higher probability of switching to a crisis regime. Thus, the empirical results presented here support the view that a high interest rate policy is unable to defend the exchange rate. Unlike other studies which consider linear models only, our findings are robust and consistent over different countries and crisis episodes (Asian 1997 crises, Mexico 1994 crisis, and Turkey 1994, 2001 crises). Chapter 2 examines the impact of macroeconomic policy shocks in a flexible-price general equilibrium business cycle model with money. In addition to technology shocks, I include government consumption, government investment, the tax rate and monetary policy as sources of random disturbances. The results show that this extended model does a good job of mimicking the characteristics of post-war business cycles, which may imply that monetary and fiscal shocks play an important role in the explanation of post-war business cycles. In particular, rather than adopting a money supply rule, monetary policy is modelled as the central bank using a simple interest rate rule (Taylor rule). Without assuming price stickiness or frictions in financial markets, the model can account for liquidity effects, generate high persistence in output and inflation, and capture positive cross-correlations between inflation and output. In Chapter 3, we show that recent studies which emphasize the importance of heterogeneity and aggregation bias may underestimate the half-lives of PPP deviations because of failure to account for small sample bias. Such bias plays a predominant role in good-specific persistence. Imbs et al.(2002) claim that there is no PPP puzzle when cross-sectional heterogeneity of goods is allowed for. After correcting small sample bias by methods proposed by Kilian (1998) and by So and Shin (1999), the half-life estimates rise substantially and indicate that heterogeneity and aggregation bias do not help to solve the PPP puzzle. In particular, when So and Shin's (1999) method is used, we find that the bias-corrected half-life estimate of PPP deviations is even higher than Rogoff's 3-5 year ""remarkable consensus"". In other words, we find that the purchasing power parity puzzle is worse than you think.",2004,2023-02-13 13:37:07,2023-02-13 13:37:07,,,,,,,,,,,,,University of Wisconsin,,,,,eoh,,EBSCOhost,,,,,,"Inflation; Business Fluctuations; Cycles E32; Deflation E31; Foreign Exchange F31; Interest Rates: Determination, Term Structure, and Effects E43; Monetary Policy E52; Price Level; Fiscal and Monetary Policy in Development O23; International Linkages to Development; Role of International Organizations O19",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,4075,1,222,744

I also propose another approach, namely, imposing restrictions on implied shock history. My argument is that in certain cases, especially in the case of the Hungarian economy, the latter identification scheme may be more credible. In order to obtain robust results I use two datasets. To tackle possible structural breaks I make alternative estimates on a shorter sample as well. The main conclusions are the followings: (1) although the two identification approaches produced very similar results, imposing restrictions on history may help to dampen counterintuitive reaction of prices; (2) after 1995 a typical unanticipated monetary policy contraction (a roughly 25 basis points rate hike) resulted in an immediate 1 per cent appreciation of the nominal exchange rate (3) followed by a 0.3% lower output and 0.1-0.15% lower consumer prices; (4) the impact on prices is slower than on output; it reaches its bottom 4-6 years after the shock, resembling the intuitive choreography of sticky-price models; (5) using additional observations prior to 1995 makes identification more difficult indicating the presence of a marked structural break.",2005,2023-03-16 15:47:19,2023-03-16 15:47:19,1678449375.0,,,,,,,,,,,,MNB Working Papers,,eng,,Working Paper,,,www.econstor.eu,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2005/1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,9956,1,111,746

We provide a counterfactual analysis of the early 80's, setting the monetary policy shocks to zero after December 1979, and recalculating the data. We found that the differences between observed real GDP and counterfactually calculated real GDP was not very large.

In addition, an increasing body of empirical evidence suggests that the linear conditional expectations implied by standard VAR models do not always accord with the observed facts. For example, a significant number of empirical studies document asymmetries in the effects of monetary policy on output growth. This paper employs a more general nonlinear VAR methodology to re-examine previous findings that credit market conditions contribute to economic fluctuations as a propagator of shocks. Unlike linear projections it allows for nonlinear dynamics and asymmetric effects of shocks. We estimate a threshold vector autoregression (TVAR), in which the system's dynamics change back and forth between credit constrained and unconstrained regimes.

How is a financial shock identified? Using different economic models, this dissertation addresses these questions. In Chapter 1, I construct an economic model with Iacoviello's (2005) heterogeneous style, financial intermediaries, a risk-rating mechanism, and Calvo-style sticky price. I find that monetary policy should respond to bank spread, an instrumental variable for a financial shock. Optimal monetary rules with high financial stability targeting would increase the response to this spread. Sub-optimal monetary rules with a high response to inflation also respond more to this spread. Additionally, I show that monetary and fiscal policy coordination is necessary and that fiscal policy becomes more important when a financial shock becomes more volatile. Motivated by an empirical VAR model (a la Christiano et al., 1999), Chapter 2 models an economy with financial intermediaries and a financial shock. There is also a risk-rating mechanism based on a firms' external finance dependence since firms need heterogeneous funds for a new investment. I propose a set of economic indicators to identify this shock. I again show that the conduct of monetary policy should pay attention to stability in the financial market while still keeping an eye on other horizons, including inflation and output. If so, the cost of price rigidity is lower and the social aggregate welfare is higher. The last chapter empirically examines if a financial shock, which plays an important role in the theoretical models in the first two chapters, is significant. Bank spread as the difference between the prime rate and the deposit rate, is augmented into a standard VAR model as well as an ARIMAX model to investigate the properties of a disturbance to this spread. I find that this disturbance has an estimated standard error of about 0.0015, relatively significant in comparison with a monetary shock of about 0.003 in literature. In addition, a financial shock and a monetary shock have similar contributions to the fluctuations in economic activities. It means that such a financial disturbance should be carefully observed.",2010-07,2023-02-13 13:37:28,2023-02-13 13:37:28,,,,,,,,,,,,,Georgetown University,,,,,eoh,,EBSCOhost,,,,,,Monetary Policy E52; Financial Markets and the Macroeconomy E44; Central Banks and Their Policies E58,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,3356,1,222,754

As growth lags across the globe, central banks have become lead actors in spurring recovery from the Global Financial Crisis. In response, a large academic literature has developed in order to theoretically predict and measure to what extent central bank policies have succeeded in stimulating growth. The first two chapters of this dissertation focus on US monetary policy. I develop two new approaches for investigating the effectiveness of monetary policy at the ""zero lower bound"", that is, when interest rates are near zero. A novelty of these approaches is the usage of firm- and industry-level data in order to investigate effects of monetary policy. The zero bound on interest rates is the problem that--given low growth since 2008--the Federal Reserve would likely have lowered the federal funds rate further in to maximize employment and increase inflation. Previous behavior suggests that the Fed would have reduced the federal funds rate to a trough of 5 percentage points below zero. According to accepted empirics (Coibion 2012), a contractionary 5% monetary shock should lower GDP growth by a peak of 2.5%. This dissertation leverages the fact that the industry effects of detrimental monetary policy would be heterogeneous: a substantial portion of this reduction in growth would occur in industries such as construction, which typically would respond with a 10% reduction in revenues to a 5% contractionary monetary shock. In contrast, health care and other industries do not tend to respond as much to interest rates changes, and would thus likely be unaffected The first approach of this dissertation shows that growth rates of industries historically sensitive to interest rate changes, and therefore to monetary policy, do not seem to have fared poorly at the zero lower bound. This suggests that monetary policy was sufficiently accommodative since 2009 in spite of the zero bound constraint. The second approach quantifies the federal funds rate that would be implied by observed industry growth rates and macroeconomic variables following 2008. The results suggest that unconventional policy had an effect on the economy such that growth occurred as if the federal funds rate were in fact negative. Unlike previous literature, this estimate is based on growth rates of real rather than financial market variables. The technique extracts the path of the federal funds rate at the zero lower bound consistent with pre-zero lower bound macroeconomic dynamics. Given the negative interest rate estimate from this second approach, and the relative growth rates of interest rate sensitive industries, the first two chapters suggest that the combination of zero interest rates and unconventional policy succeeded in spurring economic growth in a comparable fashion to previous US recoveries. The third chapter of this dissertation focuses on an international aspect of central banking. Due to a combination of desires for precautionary savings and exchange rate undervaluation, central banks often accumulate reserves. This chapter examines the relationship between foreign reserve accumulation and domestic investment. A central bank's purchases of reserves implies an outflow of domestic savings. If capital markets are imperfect, foreign capital cannot be expected to compensate for this savings outflow. The third chapter thus measures to what extent reserve accumulation is correlated with decreases in domestic investment. In contrast to Reinhart et al. (2016), I find that reserve accumulation does not seem to hamper domestic investment. I conclude with a brief discussion of other possible explanations for the finding and directions for future research. The layout of this dissertation differs slightly from that of the three separate chapters. The first chapter presents the two approaches created for measuring monetary policy at the zero bound. The second chapter expands upon these two approaches, and shows that the findings are highly robust to specification choices, and unlikely to be caused by alternative explanations. Finally, the third chapter presents the portion of this dissertation examining open economy central bank interventions.",2016-06,2023-02-13 13:35:49,2023-02-13 13:35:49,,,,,,,,,,,,,"University of California, Santa Cruz",,,,,eoh,,EBSCOhost,,,,,,"Inflation; Deflation E31; Interest Rates: Determination, Term Structure, and Effects E43; Monetary Policy E52; Price Level; Comparative or Joint Analysis of Fiscal and Monetary Policy; Stabilization; Treasury Policy E63; Central Banks and Their Policies E58",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,789,1,111,756

A contractionary forward guidance shock raises both future output and price level, stressing the relative importance of revealing policymakers' view on future output and price level over committing to a policy stance. We also decompose non-monetary structural shocks, and find that positive shocks to output and price level lead to monetary contraction. Since information on output and price level is revealed through both monetary and non-monetary channels, some monetary and non-monetary shocks can look alike, leading to linear dependence and violating usual instrument SVAR assumptions.

Based on this, we formulated the main objective: to identify the impact of monetary policies on the dynamics of financial markets development, labor markets, and the markets for goods and services. As part of the applied methodology, the impact of the quantitative easing on the government bond yields curve was based on an indirect assessment using the seemingly unrelated regression model, considering the use of parameters from the functional benchmark form. Through the vector error correction model, another additional impact of the application of the monetary policy mechanisms on selected indicators of the considered markets was identified.

Applying the changes identified by the above models allowed us to determine the expected change in the rate of growth of the aggregate output of the euro area countries. Based on our results, we found out that Asset Purchase Programme had an impact on the growth of government bond yields issued by euro area countries, on lowering the risk rate on corporate bond markets, and increasing the nominal value of shares.

The key finding is that monetary policy in Canada has undergone important changes in monetary policy regimes since the early 1970s that correspond to changes in operating procedures and medium-term inflation targets. Overall, the Bank of Canada is found to use a “hybrid” operating procedure in different monetary policy regimes, where it sets a monetary policy rate, while “leaning against the wind” to smooth exchange-rate fluctuations and to offset unexpected increases in long-term yields in order to maintain monetary conditions.

While several avenues have been explored to explain this rise, the role of monetary policy has only recently been considered. Moreover, the overall effects of monetary policy shocks on inequality remain ambiguous both theoretically and empirically. Therefore, I propose a new study of the effects of conventional monetary policy shocks on income inequality in the United States. To do so, I use a structural vector autoregression (SVAR) model with external instruments. It consists of taking series of monetary policy shocks as proxies for structural shocks. First, I provide evidence that contractionary monetary policy shocks significantly increase inequality in the long run. Second, by breaking the income distribution down into different groups, I show that the higher an income group in the distribution is, the more favored it is by contractionary shocks. Third, I find that the increase in income of the top 1% is strikingly symmetric to the decrease of the bottom 10% after a contractionary monetary policy shock.

Some statistics are used to characterise the state of the economies from the backdrop of the 1970's up till recently. Major historical events, like the OPEC oil shocks and the ERM crisis, along with narrative evidence, are then used as a guide to identify ""monetary policy periods"", which reflect the stance of monetary policy at central banks during those events. The significance of these monetary policy periods are then assessed using an instrumental variables approach. The results find the policy periods to be significant in the majority of the countries. Chapter II: This paper examines the transmission mechanism of monetary policy within NNS models in terms of implications for movements in money market and implied CCAPM rates observed within six of the G7 countries. This chapter adopts the Christiano, Eichenbaum & Evans (1999) approach to identifying monetary policy shocks using vector autoregressions in NNS models with power utility and with habit. VAR's are used to trace out the dynamic responses of consumption, inflation and output arising from an exogenous monetary policy shock. These exhibit the typical hump-shaped responses observed in the literature. The results suggest that the movements of these two rates, as implied by the transmission mechanism of monetary policy in NNS models, are inconsistent and cannot be reconciled through the consumption Euler equation. Furthermore, they suggest that the puzzle may be resolved by de-linking real interest rates and consumption growth. Chapter: The transmission mechanism of monetary policy in NNS models predict that real interest rates and expected consumption growth should be perfectly correlated. The empirical literature on monetary policy documents a ""hump-shaped"" response of aggregate consumption to a monetary policy action, and finds the correlation between real interest rates and expected consumption growth to be low, and often negative. This paper incorporates heterogeneous agents into a NNS model with nominal inertia. The key findings are that heterogeneity and wage inertia are needed to reconcile these facts.

We estimate our model to characterize the response of bank loans by matching the theoretical impulse responses with the empirical impulse responses to a monetary policy shock.

This paper examines these findings in light of conflicting findings from VAR studies, which indicate negligible effects of innovations in the federal funds rate on long-term rates. To address the issue we use a single-equation approach where unanticipated changes in the federal funds rate are measured as residuals from policy reaction functions. We also estimate VAR specifications, which incorporate information about the timing of changes in the Federal Reserve's target federal funds rate. Our single-equation estimates provide evidence of strong responses of long rates to unanticipated changes in the federal funds rate both for the Greenspan period and for a longer period back to the mid-1960s.

I use a structural Bayesian vector autoregressive model with zero and sign restrictions to identify an unconventional monetary policy shock. The effects on output across industries within a country have substantial heterogeneity. For example, industry peak output responses in the United States vary from -0.01% to +0.35% in response to a one standard deviation shock to the central bank total asset. Industries across the three countries have some variation in output response to unconventional monetary policy, however, on average the effects are similar to conventional monetary policy. Furthermore, regression analysis shows that lower working capital is associated with a larger industry output response to unconventional monetary policy.

Using household- and firm-level datasets, I study these outcomes in the context of exploring the effects of monetary policy shocks. Most macroeconomic models use a representative agent framework to study the effects of monetary policy. In such models all consumers are assumed to be similar, therefore, it is only required to know the size of the monetary policy shock and its average impact to estimate the overall effect. But recent literature has emphasized the importance of agent heterogeneity for explaining observed aggregate dynamics and optimal policy design. Here, it matters which consumers get the extra income as people react differently to the shock. In a model with a realistically calibrated household balance sheet, monetary policy has redistribution effects because different agents have differential exposure to the interest rate and inflation risk born in their portfolios. For example, short-term or nominal borrowers will win from a sudden decrease in the interest rate and a sudden increase in inflation, while short-term lenders or nominal lenders will lose. In the first chapter of the dissertation, co authored with Anastasia Burya, we study the effect of heterogeneity in consumers' portfolios on the unemployment response to monetary policy. We develop a search efforts model with heterogeneous agents and then decompose the effect of the monetary policy shock on aggregate unemployment. The direction and the magnitude of the wealth effect will determine whether people search for jobs more actively after a monetary contraction. For example, if unemployed consumers are indebted, they experience a negative wealth effect after a contraction, search for jobs more actively and increase their probability of finding a job, therefore, reducing unemployment. In this framework, the sign of the overall effect of monetary policy on unemployment will depend on whether unemployed consumers are indebted and the magnitude of their debt. We test the prediction of the model in both micro and aggregate data. To test the prediction of the model in the micro data using the PSID panel dataset, we estimate the coefficient of the interaction term between various mortgage measures and Romer and Romer monetary policy shocks while looking at five main transition probabilities that indicate a higher increase in search efforts for indebted people after a monetary contraction: dynamic transition probability of moving from non employment to employment, moving from non participation in the labor force to employment, remaining a non participant in the labor force, remaining unemployed and taking up an extra job. In the aggregate data, we use a similar estimation approach with debt to income ratio. We also subject this to a variety of checks using age and Saiz instruments for increased robustness. In the second chapter of the dissertation, co-authored with Anastasia Burya and Martsella Davitaya, we show that inflation expectations are anchored. If inflation expectations are anchored, then their sensitivity to monetary policy should be smaller than if they are de-anchored. When the Fed pursues inflation targeting, the market expectations of Fed's reaction should affect the response to current monetary policy shocks. We use daily bond yield data to show that the sensitivity of inflation expectations to monetary policy is lower if the Fed is more responsive to inflation during the previous CPI release. Intuitively, the Fed announcement leading to a rate change that is higher than expected from the CPI release indicates that the markets expect the Fed to react more aggressively in the future. Therefore, markets do not adjust inflation expectations as much (leading to anchored inflation expectations). The empirical strategy consists of two steps. First, we measure market expectations about the Fed's reaction to inflation by regressing the changes of different interest rates around the CPI release dates on the surprise change in CPI. Second, we estimate the sensitivity of inflation expectations' response to monetary policy based on the expectations about the Fed's reaction to inflation. Product markets are characterized by the significant heterogeneity of demand elasticity between large and small firms. In many cases, the ability of larger firms to dictate prices is such that they are able to charge higher markups. In the third chapter, co-authored with Anastasia Burya, we develop a simple model of firms with heterogeneous market power. We connect the recent trend of increasing market power to the flattening of the Phillips Curve through the decreasing aggregate pass-through. We explore the sufficient statistic arising from this model and then proceed to estimate it in the data. Here, we consider heterogeneity in demand elasticity and superelasticity. In the recent literature as well, papers such as Baqaee, Farhi and Sangani (2021) and Wang and Werning (2020) have brought to attention that certain parameters of demand are important for various macroeconomic dynamics such as the flattening of the Phillips Curve. It was also shown that the degree of these effects depends on the demand parameters, such as elasticity and superelasticity. We estimate these parameters in a novel format using an empirical procedure called Granular IV, which was first described in Gabaix and Koijen (2020) and makes use of the fact that in reality, unlike baseline macroeconomic models, some firms are big enough to impact the aggregates. For this estimation, we use firm-level price data from AC Nielsen Retail Scanner database. Employing the novel empirical approach we estimate these relevant demand parameters. We estimate a demand elasticity of 3.23, in line with the literature. Our estimate for super elasticity is 3.74 which is in line with Marshall's second law of demand and for constant superelasticity parametrisation would signify the curvature of the demand curve between that of CES and linear demand.",2022-05,2023-02-13 13:34:14,2023-02-13 13:34:14,,,,,,,,,,,,,Columbia University,,,,,eoh,,EBSCOhost,,,,,,"Intergenerational Income Distribution; Unemployment; Wages; Employment; Inflation; Aggregate Human Capital; Aggregate Labor Productivity E24; Deflation E31; Interest Rates: Determination, Term Structure, and Effects E43; Monetary Policy E52; Price Level; Household Saving, Borrowing, Debt, and Wealth G51",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,12,1,221,783

The main findings reveal that contractionary monetary policy shock significantly depresses real output for many quarters in South Africa.

I attribute this difference to the transitory responses of both the monetary aggregate M2 and the exchange rate to a monetary policy shock in South Korea compared to South Africa.

The principles of monetary policy are developed in classical economics studies, which are based on the theories of Keynes, Phillips, Campbell, etc. However, classic approaches require practical validation, especially with regard to modern economic trends in times of crisis and emerging economies. Therefore, the purpose of the paper is to investigate and summarize the impact of inflation targeting and other key monetary policy instruments on fundamental economic indicators in Ukraine during periods of stability and crises. An empirical analysis is based on official statistics from Ukraine for 2011–2019. This study uses econometric methods (multivariate regression and simultaneous equation model), which are applied for the general and transmission impact of inflation on the estimation of economic growth. The results prove that inflation does not affect (less than 0.46 linear correlation) fundamental economic indicators during periods of real GDP growth and a quarterly CPI level of less than 2%. On the other hand, there are significant simultaneous regressions (more than 0.8 coefficients of determination) between unemployed, spending on real final consumption, hryvnia exchange rate and monetary policy instruments (discount rate, international reserves, amount of government bonds, M3 monetary aggregate) for periods when the quarterly CPI (consumer price index) is more than 2%.

Stability tests that exploit the SVAR identifying restriction indicate significant time variation.

The first essay compares two broad approaches to identifying the monetary policy shocks that are used to estimate the regional effects of monetary policy. One approach that has been used in the previous literature assumes that monetary policymakers respond to shocks to regional personal income but do not respond directly to shocks to national income. A second general approach assumes that monetary policymakers respond to shocks to national income but do not respond directly to region-specific income shocks. This assumption is based on descriptions of monetary policymaking that policymakers focus on the national economy and use regional information as a gauge to measure the national economy. The results show that the effects of monetary policy shocks on regional income differ across the two broad approaches to identifying policy shocks. Therefore, assumptions about whether monetary policymakers respond directly to regional shocks seem to matter for estimating the regional effects of monetary policy. In the second essay, the analysis of the effects of monetary policy is extended to the state level. Using the same methods as in the first essay, we investigate whether responses of statelevel income to monetary policy differ from one state to another, whether responses of state-level income differ from the region’s overall response, and whether the method of identifying policy shocks matters. Comparisons of states’ responses to monetary policy shocks show that each state’s response is sometimes quite different from the response of the other states in that region and from the overall response of its region. In the third essay, the robustness of the results in the first two chapters to the specification of model and the use of alternative definitions of national output are examined.",,2023-03-16 15:49:00,2023-03-16 15:49:00,1678472863.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,de,,,,,,,,,,https://www.proquest.com/openview/a81c7fcb4a440e6fadac1cf2e91793b4/1?pq-origsite=gscholar&cbl=18750&diss=y,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,10602,1,222,806

Some Evidence from Macedonia.,,,,,https://www.econstor.eu/handle/10419/173712,"Surplus liquidity in the banking system changes the monetary transmission mechanism, reducing the effectiveness of the traditional instrument, the interest rate. In this paper we examine the real effects of several monetary-policy instruments in Macedonia, an economy characterized by surplus liquidity. We use regime-switching Vector Autoregressions and track the responses of different economic activity indicators to changes in the monetary policy instruments. Our findings suggest that the interest rate channel is weakly effective in Macedonia. The responses to the other instruments are not very sizeable, either, but are significant. This implies that monetary policy can affect economic activity through the reserve requirement and the offered amount of central bank bills. These findings have implications for both the analysis and the conduct of monetary policy in economies with surplus liquidity. Regarding analysis, the implication is that the traditional approach, which considers only the role of the interest rate, is likely to lead to wrong conclusions. Regarding conduct, the implication is that monetary authorities, besides on the price impact of the interest rate, should additionally rely on the reserve requirement and other available instruments producing volume impact.",2015,2023-03-16 15:32:44,2023-03-16 15:32:44,1677092097.0,,,,,,,Can Monetary Policy Affect Economic Activity under Surplus Liquidity?,,,,,Working Paper,,eng,,Working Paper,,,www.econstor.eu,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,[2015-03],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,6346,1,111,808

The effectiveness of the repo rate as a policy instrument to control the level of inflation has been widely criticised not only in the South African context but also internationally. With the critics pointing out from a substantial lag for monetary policy changes to affect inflation to the inability of the policy instrument to effectively affect inflation level. In assessing the effectiveness of the monetary policy in South Africa, this paper makes use of the structural vector error correction model (SVECM) to characterise the dynamics of inflation to monetary policy shocks.

These different sectors respond heterogeneously to identical unanticipated macroeconomic stimuli. Using a Vector Autoregression model this study finds that the impact of a monetary policy shock at the sectoral level is heterogeneous with manufacturing being the most responsive. The sectors such as Manufacturing, Mining and Quarrying, Construction and Trade are the fastest to respond. The differential sectoral effects depend upon factors such as capital intensity, interest sensitivity, export-orientation, production planning strategies among others. The sectors also differ in terms of the most effective channel of monetary transmission. The interest rate channel has emerged as the most efficient channel of the monetary policy transmission in most of the sectors followed by the credit channel. Therefore, the heterogeneous sectoral responses indicate the need for a more sector-specific monetary policy.JEL Classification: E50, E52, E58, O53",2014-06-01,2023-03-16 15:45:29,2023-03-16 15:45:29,1678406400.0,127-154,,1,3,,,,,,,,,,en,,,,,SAGE Journals,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,9609,1,221,818

Thus, Hungary and Poland's distinctive feature is the presence of a price puzzle effect combined with a high influence of the exchange rate which acts both as a mechanism of monetary policy transmission and as a supply and demand shock absorber.

Both unanticipated and anticipated fiscal shocks, that is, government expenditure and revenue shocks, are also identified by minimal sign restrictions. In identifying those shocks, we do not impose any restrictions on the sign of the key variable of interest. We find that private investment and consumption significantly increase due to expansionary government expenditure shock. Such an increase in private consumption is consistent with neo-Keynesian prediction. The fall in output due to the tax increase shock is highly robust. Private consumption also decreases due to a tax increase, although investment does not. The results suggest that fiscal policy, especially tax policy, is more effective than monetary policy in stabilizing output.

We obtain well‐behaved and comparable effects of monetary policy shocks. Second, efficiency frontiers for the selected EMU countries are estimated. In computing the optimal combinations of output gap and inflation volatility we use a weighted average of interest rate and exchange rate, i.e. the Monetary Condition Index (MCI), as a policy instrument. The impulse response analysis implemented with the MCI shows relatively small differences in the responses of the real economy to monetary policy shocks.

However, answering questions of economic interest often requires knowing the effects of a 'unit' shock. For example, central bankers want to answer questions like 'what are the effects of a 100 basis point increase in the policy rate?' The problem is that set-identifying restrictions do not always rule out the possibility that a variable does not react contemporaneously to its own shock. As a consequence, identified sets for the impulse responses to unit shocks may be unbounded, which implies that set-identifying restrictions may be extremely uninformative. Simply assuming that responses are non-zero turns out to be an arbitrary and unsatisfactory solution. I argue that it is therefore important to communicate about the extent to which the identified set may be unbounded, since this tells us about the informativeness of the identifying restrictions, and I develop tools to facilitate this. I explain how to draw useful posterior inferences about impulse responses when identified sets are unbounded with positive probability. I illustrate the empirical relevance of these issues by estimating the response of US output to a 100 basis point federal funds rate shock under different sets of identifying restrictions. Some restrictions are very uninformative about the effects of a 100 basis point shock. The output responses I obtain under a rich set of identifying restrictions lie towards the smaller end of the range of existing estimates.",2022,2023-02-13 13:35:41,2023-02-13 13:35:41,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,eoh,Availability Note: Information provided in collaboration with the RePEc Project: http://repec.org,EBSCOhost,,,,,,Monetary Policy E52; Diffusion Processes; Dynamic Quantile Regressions; Dynamic Treatment Effect Models; Multiple or Simultaneous Equation Models: Time-Series Models; State Space Models C32,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2128,1,111,829

Also using average pair-wise cross-section error correlations, the GVAR approach is shown to be quite effective in dealing with the common factor interdependencies and international comovements of business cycles. Second, in addition to generalised impulse response functions, we propose an identification scheme to derive structural impulse responses.

The alternative approach incorporates available measures of market participants' expectations of economic variables in order to calculate economic innovations to those variables. In general, expectations measures should provide important additional information relative to a standard VAR analysis, since market participants presumably use a much richer information set than that assumed in a typical VAR model. The resulting innovations are easily incorporated in a VAR-like framework. ; The empirical results are quite surprising. First, when expectations are incorporated, the variance of all innovations is reduced substantially. Second, innovations to the federal funds rate derived using the alternative approach are only somewhat correlated with their VAR counterparts, while innovations to other economic variables are essentially uncorrelated. Still, monetary policy shocks derived using both approaches are still somewhat correlated, however, since innovations to prices and economic activity explain only a small fraction of innovations to the federal funds rate. As a consequence, the impulse responses of economic variables to the two sets of monetary policy shocks have remarkably similar properties.",1996,2023-02-13 13:34:57,2023-02-13 13:34:57,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,eoh,Availability Note: Information provided in collaboration with the RePEc Project: http://repec.org,EBSCOhost,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1072,1,222,833

In Chapter 1, I investigate the impact of US uncertainty shocks on China's macroeconomy with a focus on the dynamic response of investment. Using a structural vector autoregression model, I find that the wait-and-see mechanism of aggregate investment in the face of heightened US uncertainty disappears in China. Robust evidence confirms that the increase in state-owned enterprises' investment in response to heightened uncertainty explains this puzzle, while private-owned enterprises' investment decreases as expected. I apply regime-dependent local projections to link uncertainty shocks with credit regimes to explore whether the impact of US uncertainty shocks on investment in China has varied over time in connection with the states of bank loans. The empirical results support a positive response of state-owned enterprises' investment to increased US uncertainty during the tightening of medium- and long-term bank loans but a negative reaction when short-term bank loans are tightening. Finally, I show that economic policy uncertainty conveying political signals leads to a decline in state-owned enterprises' investment. Overall, this paper provides richer empirical evidence on the investment-uncertainty nexus. In Chapter 2, I examine the time-varying responses of monetary policy to uncertainty shocks in China. Based on China's monetary policy regimes identified by the narrative approach to identify China's monetary policy regimes, the rolling sample VAR confirms the time-varying patterns of distinct monetary policy instruments in coping with uncertainty shocks. The time-varying parameters VAR further shows that heightened uncertainty leads to a persistent decline in the policy rate and money supply, suggesting that the interest rate is a more effective monetary policy instrument in response to uncertainty shocks. I finally investigate the state-dependent impulse responses to monetary policy shocks under low and high levels of uncertainty and find that money supply instrument is less effective during the high uncertainty periods while the efficacy of interest rate instrument won't be weakened by the increasing uncertainty. Overall, the empirical findings support the on-going transformation of China's monetary policy from the quantity-based to the price-based policy rule. In Chapter 3, I explore the cross-country economic policy uncertainty (EPU) spillovers in time and frequency domains, with a focus on how China's EPU influences EPU in other countries. The time-domain analysis shows that China is a net receiver of global EPU but has stronger outward spillovers during the global financial crisis. The connectedness network demonstrates that China only plays a minor role in the transmission network of global EPU. The frequency-domain results further uncover that international spillovers of China's EPU are mainly driven by short-term spillovers. However, during the global financial crisis, the medium-term and long-term spillovers temporarily dominate compared to the short-term spillovers. Overall, the empirical results have important policy implications because economic policy uncertainty arising abroad might have domestic consequences through international spillovers channel.",2020-09,2023-02-13 13:34:42,2023-02-13 13:34:42,,,,,,,,,,,,,University of New Hampshire,,,,,eoh,,EBSCOhost,,,,,,"Monetary Policy E52; Financial Crises G01; Macroeconomic Analyses of Economic Development O11; Fiscal and Monetary Policy in Development O23; Inflation P24; Money; Socialist Systems and Transitional Economies: National Income, Product, and Expenditure; Public Enterprises; Public-Private Enterprises L32",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,736,1,112,847

A block-restricted VAR is then used to measure the spillover of ECB policy abroad. The importance of euro area monetary policy for macroeconomic developments is confirmed for all six countries.

The spillovers on uncertainty are more pronounced in economies with flexible exchange rates, where the degree of financial market openness tends to be higher and where exchange rate appreciations further enhance risk taking by cushioning debt burdens from foreign currency loans.

Initially, banks do not reduce lending to firms and households and they present a sluggish reaction concerning the relevant interest rates. On the contrary, they reduce lending to mortgage credit institutions significantly since real estate lending can be considered as a risky long-term investment. Moreover mortgage credit institutions reduce lending for housing purposes to non-bank public. This reduction is mainly driven by flexible rate loans and loans secured on tenant owned apartments. Consequently, theses actions have a significant effect on real economic activity, by amplifying the initial shock from the tightening monetary policy.

Deriving exact conditions we establish that, (i) in a two dimensional factor model only two out of potentially infinite sign restrictions are relevant and (ii) in contrast, in cases of higher dimension every additional sign restriction can be relevant improving structural identification. The latter result can render our approach a blessing in high dimensions.

We find that a rise in monetary policy uncertainty increases unemployment and lowers core inflation; the effects on unemployment in particular are robust (a gradual 0.4 percentage point increase), lasting more than two years after the initial shock. Interest rate uncertainty shocks explain a significant portion of macro fluctuations, particularly after the 2007-09 global financial crisis contributing to push the unemployment rate one percentage point higher during the early phase of the subsequent recovery. Furthermore, we find that higher interest rate uncertainty makes forward guidance shocks (but also federal funds rate shocks) less effective at moving unemployment and core inflation.

A key aim of these policies was to boost the quantity of bank credit to the non-financial corporate and household sectors. In the previous decades, however, policy-makers had not focused on bank credit. Indeed, over the past half century, different variables were raised to prominence in the quest to achieve desired nominal GDP outcomes. This paper conducts a long-overdue horse race between the various contenders in terms of their ability to account for observed nominal GDP growth, using a half-century of UK data since 1963. Employing the ‘General-to-Specific’ methodology, an equilibrium-correction model is estimated suggesting a long-run cointegrating relationship between disaggregated real economy credit and nominal GDP.

Using Bayesian MCMC estimation method we estimate a model consisting of output, inflation rates, interest rates, and exchange rates for the United States, Canada, Germany, Japan, and the United Kingdom. We find uniformly strong evidence over time that the exchange rate overshoots in response to an exogenous monetary policy shock. Furthermore, we find that the monetary policy shock played a significant role in the exchange rate dynamics, and its contributions were particularly large during the 2008-2009 financial crisis. Essay2: Commodity Return Comovement, Exchange Rate, and Uncertainty Shock This paper investigates how does the uncertainty shock affect the commodity return empirically, using a time-varying parameter dynamic factor model with stochastic volatility (TVP-DFM-SV). We extract a common factor and eight sector-specific factors from 43 different commodity returns(Ma, Vivian and Wohar, 2019). The common factor is interpreted as the combination of the shocks which only affects the commodity markets idiosyncratic through the general equilibrium (Alquist, Bhattarai and Coibion, 2019), and is orthogonal to the sector-specific factors and commodity-idiosyncratic factors. Then we show the time-varying impulse responses of the common factor and several relevant macro fundamentals to uncertainty shock identified by the external instrument variable (IV). We find that uncertainty shock decreases the commodity return through the common factor, and this effect is time-varying, specifically, during the recession it is stronger. Besides, the uncertainty shock could be a reason behind the negative relationship between commodity return and the strength of US dollar. Essay 3: A New Approach to Connecting the Dividend-Price Ratio and Stock Returns There is a long debate on the performance of dividend-price ratio on the stock returns predictability. Most of the literature argues that the predictability decreases after the 1990s. Since Campbell-Shiller decomposition shows that the dividend-price ratio contains the information of both the future returns and future dividend growth, a linear predictive regression of stock returns on the dividend-price ratio may generate biased results due to the measurement error or omitted variable issues. Therefore, this paper proposes a new approach to study the nonlinear Granger causality of dividend-price ratio on stock returns. We conduct an unobserved component model and connect stock returns and the dividend-price ratio through their innovations. We show that our model can be represented by a reduced-form ARMAX process, and it can increase the predictability both in-sample and out-of-sample.",2021-05,2023-02-13 13:35:49,2023-02-13 13:35:49,,,,,,,,,,,,,Northeastern University,,,,,eoh,,EBSCOhost,,,,,,Foreign Exchange F31; Monetary Policy E52; Commodity Markets Q02; Equities; Fixed Income Securities G12; Payout Policy G35,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2307,1,222,905

We find strong evidence that monetary policy is designed to support real GDP growth mandated by the central government while resisting inflation pressures and that contributions of monetary policy shocks to the GDP fluctuation are asymmetric across different states of the economy.

In the modeling strategy, a priori sign restrictions play an important role. They are imposed not on impulse response functions but directly on the reduced form single or multi-step equations, unlike in recent work by Uhlig and Canova. This is possible because in this context, the reduced form inherits important structural sign properties; basically, that autonomous expenditure has positive effects on near future GDP. We consider an economically large class of variables, including effects from interest rates, the credit channel and asset prices, the real exchange rate, yield spreads, inflation and interest rate volatility, oil prices (including asymmetries), structural breaks in fiscal and monetary policy, the recent behaviour of consumption, investment and profitability, and the evolutionary effect of globalization on the balance of payments constraint. We follow a general to specific methodology, including the help of PCGETS (Hendry and Krolzig, 2001) to reduce general models to more parsimonious ones. Relative to conventional VARs, our models imply longer lag structures than ever considered in VARs, as well as non-linearities, and so could never have been found with conventional VAR restrictions. Our results thus contradict the suggestion of Sims (1980) that VARs can resolve the problem of 'incredible restrictions' embodied in large macro econometric models. Our exercise of learning from the data through general to specific modeling is likely, in many cases, also to contradict the lag structures of such models. We present a range of models with remarkable recursive forecasting performance since 1982 and show that similar models could have been selected with 1982 data by applying similar methods then.

New Keynesian models supplement older DSGE or ""real business cycle"" models with such ""old Keynesian"" features as imperfect competition and price stickiness using menu costs or stochastic price rigidity, allowing a larger role for monetary shocks to affect the real economy. The first paper, ""Forecasting output and inflation with a Bayesian VAR using a New Keynesian prior,"" examines the forecasting performance of a simple New Keynesian DSGE model. The DSGE model can be used to calculate a prior mean and covariance matrix for the coefficients of a VAR forecasting model for output, inflation and interest rates, using Ingram and Whiteman's (1994) technique for using DSGE models to calculate priors for Bayesian vector autoregression (BVAR) forecasting models. The resulting BVAR generates forecasts of inflation competitive with those from a BVAR with an atheoretical prior. However, the New Keynesian BVAR results in very poor output forecasts, particularly in the short run, suggesting some source of misspecification in the New Keynesian DSGE model. The second paper, ""Loss-based evaluation of a New Keynesian DSGE model,"" evaluates and compares the in-sample specification of a simple New Keynesian DSGE model to a cash-in-advance model without price stickiness and to an identified classical VAR, in a manner similar to Schorfheide's (2000) study of the portfolio adjustment cost model. By calculating Bayes factors and posterior probabilities for each model, one can construct a benchmark distribution for correlations and impulse response functions to which one can compare the correlations and impulse responses of the DSGE models, according to a variety of loss functions. The paper finds that very different levels of price stickiness are compatible with the data, making use of outside prior information crucial in assessing the role of the Phillips curve and of ""supply-side"" and ""demand-side"" shocks in business cycles. This point is further underlined in the third paper, ""Technology shocks versus monetary shocks: Identifying sources of business cycle fluctuations with a New Keynesian DSGE Model."" This time, the model is a three-variable New Keynesian DSGE model of output, inflation and interest rates, including habit formation in preferences as well as stochastic price rigidity. Following recent papers such as that of Smets and Wouters (2002), the paper estimates the three-variable DSGE model with Bayesian methods similar to those used in the previous paper. It goes on to report Bayes factors for the DSGE model along with several Bayesian VAR models, and find the DSGE model competitive with a four-lag BVAR. The model is used to estimate series for monetary shocks, technology/supply shocks, and autonomous demand shocks for the United States since 1965. The paper finds that monetary policy shocks have probably been of only secondary importance, as compared to that of supply shocks, in movements in US inflation, as well as output, since 1965.",2004,2023-02-13 13:34:54,2023-02-13 13:34:54,,,,,,,,,,,,,Michigan State University,,,,,eoh,,EBSCOhost,,,,,,Inflation; Business Fluctuations; Cycles E32; Deflation E31; Price Level; General Aggregative Models: Keynes; Keynesian; Post-Keynesian E12; General Aggregative Models: Neoclassical E13; Computable and Other Applied General Equilibrium Models D58,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1012,1,221,917

Researchers frequently find evidence of a 'price puzzle': increases in the policy rate are followed by higher rather than lower inflation. This can be explained by the forward-looking behaviour of the central bank. Inflation does not rise in response to an increase in the policy rate but, instead, the central bank raises its policy rate when it expects inflation to increase in the future. To identify the true causal effects of monetary policy on inflation, it is hence necessary to control for this systematic policy response to expected inflation. For Australia, however, the price puzzle has been found even when controlling for the cash rate's systematic response to the Reserve Bank's own inflation forecasts. I argue that this is due to an additional but omitted systematic response of the cash rate to credit market shocks. Easier credit market conditions lead to an economic expansion and higher inflation. Therefore, the Bank raises the cash rate--its policy rate--when credit spreads decline. However, the Bank's inflation forecasts do not fully capture the inflationary effect of easier credit conditions. As a result, cash rate changes are positively correlated with future inflation even when purging them of the cash rate's response to the Bank's inflation forecasts. Accordingly, I show that accounting for the cash rate's additional response to credit market conditions resolves the price puzzle. As expected, a higher cash rate reduces inflation and output growth, and raises the unemployment rate.",2020,2023-02-13 13:35:25,2023-02-13 13:35:25,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,eoh,Availability Note: Information provided in collaboration with the RePEc Project: http://repec.org,EBSCOhost,,,,,,"Inflation; Business Fluctuations; Cycles E32; Deflation E31; Interest Rates: Determination, Term Structure, and Effects E43; Monetary Policy E52; Price Level",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1749,1,111,925

We estimate a standard New Keynesian dynamic stochastic general equilibrium model with the cost channel of monetary policy for the South African economy to show that whether the South African Reserve Bank should apply contractionary policy to fight inflation depends critically on the nature of the disturbance. If an increase in expected future inflation is mainly due to supply shocks, the South African Reserve Bank should not apply contractionary policy to fight inflation, as this would lead to a persistent increase in inflation and a greater loss in output.

In order to fill this gap, the authors explore regional responses to monetary policy in developing countries, such as Turkey. The main aim of the paper is to investigate how different regions adjust the extent of real economic activity in response to an exogenous country-wide shock in the interest rate policy. The analyses cover 81 Turkish provinces using monthly data from January 2009 to November 2019. To consider temporal and spatial patterns in the same framework, time-series analyses via unit root, co-integration, and VAR with spatial methods have been combined, including exploratory spatial data analysis and spatial econometric models. Preliminary findings validate that regional economic activity measured by employment responses is heterogeneous across provinces and policy regimes. Among the different determinants in assessing responsiveness to monetary policy shocks, interest rate, broad credit channels, and certain regional demographics have explanatory power. Moreover, sizeable spatial spillovers have been detected, which are believed to be crucial in evaluating the externalities and the exact impact of the country-wide policy shock in Turkey.

I uncover that regional risk is strongly countercyclical: the conditional standard deviation of idiosyncratic shocks to U.S. state-level output growth is estimated to be 40% larger in NBER recessions than in normal times. However, the extent to which regions insure against these risks has not varied much over the business cycle. I argue that federal fiscal transfers that operate in a ""state-contingent"" manner during recessions can reconcile these results. To understand what these patterns of regional risk and fiscal integration imply for the aggregate, I build a New Keynesian model of heterogeneous regions with an incomplete asset market. The calibrated model suggests that during an economic downturn, increased regional risk worsens risk sharing, due to more regions being constrained at the borrowing limit; meanwhile, it amplifies the impact of aggregate productivity shocks, due to stronger precautionary saving motives leading to lower aggregate demand. However, state-contingent federal government transfers stabilize both the regional and aggregate economy, by providing insurance to the regions that need it the most--those with low productivities and high marginal propensities to consume. Taken together, this paper demonstrates the power of regional redistributive policies as automatic stabilizers in a fiscal union.

We confirm the precision of our estimated panel with multiple tests, and discuss its potential applications. In one application, we apply this dataset to studying the monetary policy impacts across states.

We construct a new quarterly state-level dataset that we use to analyze the impact of unexpected changes in federal personal and corporate income taxes. We find substantial heterogeneity across states, with more than half having no significant response to the tax cuts. In addition, less capital-intensive states have larger responses to corporate tax cuts. Although puzzling in standard models, a model with corporate and non-corporate sectors is consistent with this evidence. Overall, our results suggest the importance of variation and reallocation across states in evaluating federal policy.",2020-08,2023-02-13 13:35:25,2023-02-13 13:35:25,,,,,,,,,,,,,University of Wisconsin,,,,,eoh,,EBSCOhost,,,,,,"Business Fluctuations; Cycles E32; General Aggregative Models: Keynes; Keynesian; Modern Monetary Theory E12; Post-Keynesian; Regional Economic Activity: Growth, Development, Environmental Issues, and Changes R11; Fiscal Policy E62",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1737,1,222,934

Our approach is also an alternative to recent efforts to calibrate real business cycle models. In contrast to these existing models, the one we present embodies all the following important characteristics: i) It generates a complete multivariate stochastic process model for the data it aims to explain, and the full specification is used in the maximum likelihood estimation of the model; ii) It integrates modeling of nominal variables--money stock, price level, wage level, and nominal interest rate--with modeling real variables; iii) It contains a Keynesian investment function, breaking the tight relationship of the return on investment with the capital-output ratio; iv) It treats both monetary and fiscal policy explicitly; v) It is based on dynamic optimizing behavior of the private agents in the model. Flexible-price and sticky-price versions of the model are estimated and their fits are evaluated relative to a naive model of no-change in the variables and to an unrestricted VAR.

The purpose of this study is to investigate the inflationary tendencies in India particularly from the fiscal point of view. The study also examines the influence of other potential determinants such as output growth rate, interest rate, trade-openness (TO) and oil price inflation (OPI). Design/methodology/approach: To examine the dynamic nature of association between fiscal deficit and inflation, the study applies the Toda-Yamamoto (1995) test and Breitung and Candelon (2006) test to investigate the nature of causality in time and frequency domain frameworks. In addition, to scrutinize the possibility of a long-run association, that too from an asymmetric point of view, the study applies a Non-linear Autoregressive Distributed lag model (NARDL) given by Shin et al. (2014). Finally, non-linear cumulative dynamic multipliers are used to trace the traverse between disequilibrium position of short-run and subsequent long-run equilibrium of the system. Findings: The authors found a unidirectional causality from fiscal deficit to inflation in case of time domain analysis and no feedback causality is reported. However, in case of frequency domain design, causality from fiscal deficit to inflation is found at low frequencies only, i.e. no short-run causality is established and hence dynamic nature of the relationship between the two variables is vindicated. Using NARDL model, the results document the existence of an asymmetric long-run direct association between fiscal deficit and inflation. However, an increase in deficit is found to be more inflationary and a decrease affects the inflation with a lower magnitude. The asymmetric impact of fiscal deficit on inflation can be explained through the existence of liquidity constraints, consumption-investment downward inflexibility and the downward price stickiness. Contractionary monetary policy action is found to be more effective than an expansionary one, signifying the asymmetric influence of monetary policy actions on the inflation of India. Similarly, in a supply-constrained economy with downward price rigidity, the authors found an asymmetric impact of output growth and output decline on inflation. As regard to the trade-openness, although an asymmetry is reported, the signs refute the validation of Romer (1993) hypothesis. Finally, the impact of oil price inflation on the inflationary pressures is according to theory but the coefficients are devoid of statistical significance.",2020-12,2023-02-13 13:35:11,2023-02-13 13:35:11,,363-393,,50,25,,"Journal of Economics, Finance and Administrative Science",,,,,,,,,,,eoh,,EBSCOhost,,,,,,Inflation; Deflation E31; Monetary Policy E52; Price Level; Fiscal Policy E62; Macroeconomic Analyses of Economic Development O11; Fiscal and Monetary Policy in Development O23; National Deficit; Surplus H62,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1393,1,221,936

The empirical factor literature argues that the co-movement of large panels of macroeconomic and financial data can be captured by relatively few common unobserved factors. Similarly, the dynamics in DSGE models are often governed by a handful of state variables and exogenous processes such as latent preference and/or technology shocks. A general topic of this dissertation is the estimation of DSGE models on a rich panel of macroeconomic and financial data by combining a DSGE with a dynamic factor model. By incorporating richer information, this combination allows to obtain DSGE model predictions and to do more reliable policy analysis with a broader range of data series of interest than before. Moreover, the combination of a DSGE and a dynamic factor model can be used as a tool for evaluating a DSGE model. This dissertation consists of three essays summarized below. Chapter 1 ""Bayesian Dynamic Factor Analysis of a Simple Monetary DSGE Model"": We take a standard New Keynesian business cycle model to a richer data set. When estimating DSGE models, the number of observable economic variables is usually kept small, and for convenience it is assumed that the model variables are perfectly measured by a single--often quite arbitrarily selected--data series. We relax these two assumptions and estimate a fairly simple monetary DSGE model on a richer data set. Building upon Boivin and Giannoni (2006), the framework can be seen as a combination of a DSGE model and a dynamic factor model in which factors are economic state variables and the factor dynamics are governed by a DSGE model solution. Using post-1983 U.S. data on real output, inflation, nominal interest rates, measures of inverse money velocity, and a large panel of informational series, we compare the data-rich DSGE model with a regular--few observables, perfect measurement--DSGE model in terms of deep parameter estimates, propagation of monetary policy and technology shocks and sources of business cycle fluctuations. We document that the data-rich DSGE model generates a higher implied duration of Calvo price contracts and a lower slope of the New Keynesian Phillips curve. Because of the data set's high panel dimension, the likelihood-based estimation of the data-rich DSGE model is computationally very challenging. To reduce the costs, we employed a novel speedup as in Jungbacker and Koopman (2008) and achieved the computational time savings of 60 percent. Chapter 2 ""Data-Rich DSGE and Dynamic Factor Models"": In addition to a datarich DSGE model with a standard New Keynesian core, we consider an unrestricted dynamic factor model and estimate both on a rich panel of U.S. macroeconomic and financial data compiled by Stock and Watson (2008). We find that the spaces spanned by the common empirical factors and by the data-rich DSGE model states are very close. First, this implies that a DSGE model indeed captures the essential sources of co-movement in the data and that the differences in fit between a data-rich DSGE model and a DFM are potentially due to restricted factor loadings in the former. Second, this also implies a greater degree of comfort about propagation of structural shocks to a wide array of macro and financial series. Third, the proximity of factor spaces facilitates economic interpretation of a dynamic factor model, as the empirical factors are now isomorphic to the DSGE model state variables with clear economic meaning. Finally, the proximity of factor spaces allows us to propagate monetary policy and technology innovations in an otherwise completely non-structural dynamic factor model to obtain predictions for many more series than just a handful of traditional macro variables including measures of real activity, price indices, labor market indicators, interest rate spreads, money and credit stocks, and exchange rates. We can therefore provide a more complete and comprehensive picture of the effects of monetary policy and technology shocks. Chapter 3 ""DSGE Model Based Forecasting of Non-Modeled Variables"" (joint work with Frank Schorfheide and Keith Sill): We develop and illustrate a simple method to generate a DSGE model-based forecast for variables that do not explicitly appear in the model (non-core variables). Estimation is performed in two steps. First, we estimate the regular DSGE model on core observables. Second, we obtain filtered DSGE model state variables and use them as regressors in auxiliary linear regressions--resembling DFM measurement equations--for the non-core variables. Predictions for the non-core variables are then obtained by applying their estimated measurement equations to DSGE model-generated forecasts of the state variables. This estimation approach can be viewed as a simplified version of a data-rich DSGE model estimation in which we essentially decouple the analysis of the non-core measurement equations and the estimation of a DSGE model on the core observables. The proposed shortcut is practically appealing: we considerably reduce the associated computational costs and we can incorporate and forecast an additional non-core variable without having to re-estimate the whole DSGE model, a feature useful in real-time applications. We apply our approach to generate and evaluate recursive forecasts for personal consumption expenditure (PCE) inflation, core PCE inflation, the unemployment rate, and housing starts.",2010-05,2023-02-13 13:37:03,2023-02-13 13:37:03,,,,,,,,,,,,,University of Pennsylvania,,,,,eoh,,EBSCOhost,,,,,,Inflation; Business Fluctuations; Cycles E32; Deflation E31; Price Level; General Aggregative Models: Keynes; Keynesian; Post-Keynesian E12; General Aggregative Models: Neoclassical E13,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,3991,1,222,937

We show that the response of asset prices to changes in monetary policy can be identified based on the increase in the variance of policy shocks that occurs on days of FOMC meetings and of the Chairman's semi-annual monetary policy testimony to Congress. The identification approach employed requires a much weaker set of assumptions than needed under the “event-study” approach that is typically used in this context. The results indicate that an increase in short-term interest rates results in a decline in stock prices and in an upward shift in the yield curve that becomes smaller at longer maturities.

The first paper is my job market paper. In it, I investigate the role of systematic U.S. monetary policy in the presence of oil price shocks. The second paper compares different approaches to modeling oil demand. The third paper studies the empirical performance of Laplace type estimators for estimation of macroeconomic models. Optimal Monetary Policy and Oil Price Shocks. In an influential paper, Bernanke, Gertler, and Watson (1997) and (2004) argue that systematic monetary policy exacerbated the recessions the U.S. economy experienced in the aftermath of post World War II oil price shocks. In my job market paper, I critically evaluate this claim in the context of an estimated medium-scale model of the U.S. business cycle. Specifically, I solve for the Ramsey optimal monetary policy in the medium-scale dynamic stochastic general equilibrium model (henceforth DSGE) of Schmitt-Groh and Uribe (2005). To model the demand for oil, I use the approach of Finn (2000). According to this approach, the utilization of capital services requires oil usage. In the related literature on the macroeconomic effects of oil price shocks, it is common to calibrate structural parameters of the model. In contrast to this literature, I estimate the parameters of my DSGE model. The estimation strategy involves matching the impulse responses from the theoretical model to responses predicted by an empirical model. For estimation, I use the alternative to the classical Laplace type estimator proposed by Chernozhukov and Hong (2003). To obtain the empirical impulse responses, I identify an oil price shock in a structural VAR (SVAR) model of the U.S. business cycle. The SVAR model predicts that, in response to an oil price increase, GDP, investment, hours, capital utilization, and the real wage fall, while the nominal interest rate and inflation rise. These findings are economically intuitive and in line with the existing empirical evidence. Comparing the actual and the Ramsey optimal monetary policy response to an oil price shock, I find that the optimal policy allows for more inflation, a larger drop in wages, and a rise in hours compared to those actually observed. The central finding of this paper is that the optimal policy is associated with a smaller drop in GDP and other macroeconomic variables. The latter results therefore confirm the claim of Bernanke, Gertler and Watson that monetary policy was to a large extent responsible for the recessions that followed the oil price shocks. However, under the optimal policy, interest rates are tightened even more than what is predicted by the empirical model. This result contrasts sharply with the claim of Bernanke, Gertler, and Watson that the Federal Reserve exacerbated recessions by the excessive tightening of interest rates in response to the oil price increases. In contrast to related studies that focus on output stabilization, I find that eliminating the negative response of GDP to an oil price shock is not desirable. Comparing Different Ways to Introduce Energy. The existing literature adopts different strategies to introduce energy demand into a theoretical model. In this paper, I compare how the extant approaches to modeling energy demand change the predictions of the models and policy advice. First, I compare basic models of energy demand. As the next step, I study DSGE models where nominal and real rigidities are combined with different assumptions about energy demand. I show that to provide realistic predictions about the dynamic response of macroeconomic variables, it is crucial to properly calibrate these models. I find that policy recommendations are sensitive to the choice of the model parameters. Classical Extremum and Laplace Type Estimators: a Comparison for the Estimation of Macroeconomic Models--with Riccardo DiCecio. Estimation of economic models with a large parameter space is often complicated because of highly nonlinear criterion functions used for estimation. Standard estimation techniques, such as classical extremum estimators, are time-consuming and do not guarantee that the estimates are global extrema. A new estimator, the Laplace type estimator, has been recently proposed as an alternative. This estimator is computationally more attractive and has the same asymptotic properties as its classical minimum distance counterpart. In this paper, we compare the performance of the classical minimum distance estimator with the Laplace type estimator as it applies to the estimation of macroeconomic models. The criterion function is derived from the distance of impulse responses of macroeconomic variables in the model from the corresponding responses in structural VAR representations of the data. We compare the two estimation techniques using a simple RBC economy, subject to neutral and embodied technology shocks. We also compare the performance of the two techniques by estimating a medium scale Dynamic Stochastic General Equilibrium model routinely used to study the effect of monetary policy shocks.",2008,2023-02-13 13:34:50,2023-02-13 13:34:50,,,,,,,,,,,,,Duke University,,,,,eoh,,EBSCOhost,,,,,,Business Fluctuations; Cycles E32; Macroeconomics: Production E23; Monetary Policy E52; Energy: Demand and Supply; Prices Q41,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,916,1,222,949

This happens because of the ""turn over effect"" in Malaysian labor market, where the highly educated job seekers are competing with experienced low educated labor force. Besides that, the amount of labor employed in the agriculture and manufacturing sectors in Malaysia are also declining because of automated production line and overflow of foreign labor.

This raises two issues. The first is the theoretical underpinnings of this mode of monetary policy. The second is the channels of monetary policy or, more concretely, the channels through which changes in the rate of interest may affect the ultimate goal(s) of policy. Both aspects are investigated in this paper. Furthermore, we suggest that it is imperative to consider the empirical estimates of the effects of monetary policy. We summarise results drawn from the eurozone, the U.S. and the UK and suggest that these empirical results point to a relatively weak effect of interest rate changes on inflation.

The Structural Vector Autoregression (SVAR) model is employed to examine each province's response to unanticipated monetary policy shocks. The generalized impulse response functions from SVAR reveal that monetary policy has varied effects across the provinces. In two regions--Punjab and Sindh--monetary policy shocks cause variations in provincial outputs in similar ways. These responses are also comparable to the response of national output to changes in monetary policy but with considerable differences in magnitudes. While other provinces Khyber Pakhtunkhawa (KPK) and Balochistan show less sensitivity to unanticipated change in monetary policy.

Our results indicate that monetary policy actions seem ineffective in periods of high growth while having strong effects on output during low growth periods. Further, output responds strongly to tight monetary policy actions when the economy is in low growth phase. We also find some support for the argument that negative money supply changes affect output whereas positive changes do not. The findings also suggest that output responds only to small monetary policy shocks and big shocks do not significantly explain the variations in the transitory component of output.

This result is consistent with the existence of a ‘bank capital channel’ as well as a conventional bank lending channel. Other evidence favors the capital channel, as bank liquidity is not associated with variation in the impact of monetary policy on output at the state level.

In the first chapter, I introduce an OTC credit default swap (CDS) market into a search model of credit and unsecured debt. The model is developed to study the effects of CDS trading on liquidity, risk sharing, and corporate borrowing costs in an economy where agents are matched trilaterally to trade capital and issue debt. With firms subject to an exogenous default risk, risk averse lenders have the opportunity to purchase a CDS from insurers as protection against their underlying bonds. The model raises implications for corporate credit and investment demand; borrowing costs that vary with the degree of default risk; and potential issues pertaining to moral hazard, empty creditors, and financial sector stability. In addition, its theory corroborates empirical evidence regarding the relationship between corporate debt markets and derivatives trading. The second chapter investigates the implications of sector-specific credit supply shocks on real economic activity in the United States from 1952 to 2018. These sectors include private households, non-financial corporations, and banks. Within a structural vector autoregression (VAR) framework, I employ a novel sign-restriction strategy to identify one monetary policy shock, two aggregate macroeconomic shocks, and three sector-specific credit supply shocks. I find evidence that credit supply shocks not only vary by the sectors in which they arise, but also by their consequences for business cycle dynamics. Credit shocks originating in the banking sector can explain up to 25% of output fluctuations while those arising in the household and corporate sectors can each explain up to 15%. In addition, household and bank credit shocks may hold long-run consequences for inflation explaining up to 15% of its fluctuations. Within a historical context, the model identifies several periods when credit supply has been a significant driver of GDP. With respect to the 2008 financial crisis, I find a smaller role for credit shocks relative to aggregate supply shocks than is typically found in the literature. This supports recent empirical evidence suggesting that the early stages of the crisis were more reminiscent of an oil price shock recession. The third chapter analyzes the lending channel of monetary policy exclusively through credit card and small business bank loans. A time-varying parameter VAR is estimated providing evidence that the direction and strength in which credit card and small business loans respond to monetary policy are time-dependent. To investigate these findings analytically, I develop a general equilibrium model of consumer credit card and small business lending. Households and firms use a combination of monetary assets and bank loans to finance random consumption and investment opportunities. In accordance with conventional theory, when borrowers are sufficiently constrained, a monetary tightening reduces lending through the balance sheet subchannel of monetary policy. However, when borrowers are less constrained, a monetary tightening raises unsecured debt limits through a second subchannel and lending expands. This second subchannel, operating solely through unsecured credit, offers a new theory to justify an expansionary loan response to tightened monetary policy that the traditional lending channel literature has yet to address.",2021-03,2023-02-13 13:35:20,2023-02-13 13:35:20,,,,,,,,,,,,,"University of California, Irvine",,,,,eoh,,EBSCOhost,,,,,,Business Fluctuations; Cycles E32; Macroeconomics: Production E23; Monetary Policy E52; Financial Markets and the Macroeconomy E44; Banks; Depository Institutions; Micro Finance Institutions; Mortgages G21; Asymmetric and Private Information; Mechanism Design D82,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1620,1,222,969

Our estimates indicate a large decline in the volatility of both yield curve and macroeconomic variables around 1992, when the United Kingdom first adopted an inflation-targeting regime. During the inflation-targeting regime, monetary policy shocks have been more muted and inflation expectations have been lower than in the pre-1992 era. The link between the macroeconomy and the yield curve has also changed over time, with fluctuations in the level factor becoming less important for inflation after the Bank of England independence in 1997.

Two obstacles have prevented this integration in the past: the data gap in the federal funds rate during the zero lower bound (ZLB) period; and the utilization of a single equation rather than a system of equations to model the relationship between the mortgage rate and its determinants. First, we establish that the shadow federal funds rate introduced by Wu and Xia (2015) is a valid proxy for monetary policy during the ZLB period, and we use dimensionality reduction to create proxy variables for important macroeconomic measures. Second, we utilize the generalized impulse response approach to measure in level and first difference the impact of monetary policy and the macroeconomic environment on the long-term mortgage rate. Generally, the effect of macroeconomic variables outweighs that of monetary policy. In addition, omitting macroeconomics variables overestimates the impact of monetary policy on the mortgage rate in level and first difference. For example, shocking the first difference (level) of the federal funds rate by one standard deviation overestimates the impulse responses by 15% (51%) and the variance decompositions by 27% (37%). The current research implies that a noticeable increase in the mortgage rate is associated with an economic environment characterized both by tightening monetary policy and strong economic growth. Further, the impact of monetary tightening on the mortgage rate is expected to weaken if secular stagnation continues to prevail.",2020-04-02,2023-03-16 15:36:37,2023-03-16 15:36:37,1677607888.0,285-313,,2,42,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Taylor and Francis+NEJM,,,,,,monetary policy; Zero lower bound; federal funds rate; macroeconomics; mortgage rates,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,7350,1,222,973

The breakout of the global financial crisis highlights the importance of financial shocks. Aiming to maintaining financial stability, Bank for International Settlements (BIS) initialized macro-prudential policies in the early of 2009. China, as one of important countries pioneering the practice of macro-prudential policies, adopted a so called two-pillar regulatory framework of monetary policies and macro-prudential policies to safeguard the macroeconomic and financial stability. However, due to the coincidence of policy targets and the interdependence in transmission mechanisms between monetary policies and macro-prudential policies, the practice of the two-pillar regulatory framework raises some important coordination issues (Beau et al. 2012). The aim of this paper is to discuss theoretically the coordination mechanisms between monetary policies and macro-prudential policies, and then evaluate empirically the effects of the practice of the two-pillar regulatory framework on policy targets, such as economic growth, inflation, and financial stability in China. One of main contributions of this paper is to estimate the causal effects of China's two-pillar regulatory framework from 2007 to 2017 by adopting new macroeconomic policy evaluation methods proposed by Angrist and Kuersteiner (2011) and Angrist et al. (2018). Compared to mainstream methods such as dynamic stochastic general equilibrium (DSGE) models, the macroeconomic policy evaluation methods based on Rubin's causal model alleviate the risk of model misspecification by avoiding to specify how an economy works and how outcome variables are determined. Moreover, the concept of dynamic treatment effect developed in the framework of macroeconomic policy evaluation coincides with the nonlinear impulse function induced by structural models. In other words, the new method can complement the DSGE models by providing parallel estimates insensitive with structural model setup. Another major contribution of this paper is to extend the existing macroeconomic policy evaluation methods by adopting statistical learning methods to estimating policy propensity score functions using macroeconomic big data and proposing a new test statistic for testing the conditional unconfoundedness assumption. It is well known that a major challenge in empirical macroeconomic research is how to capture exogenous policy shocks to identify causal effects. We address this issue in two aspects. First, in order to fully use all information available at the current period, we propose to model policy-making process based on macroeconomic big data and adopt statistical learning methods to solve the high dimensional problem. Moreover, we propose a new test statistic to test the exogeneity of the residuals estimated from the policy propensity scores using macroeconomic big data, which is a conditional unconfoundedness in the context of time series data. The latter actually provides a testable method of evaluating the validity of the use of the macroeconomic policy evaluation method. Finally, our empirical findings can be summarized as follows. First, when macro-prudential policies remaining neutral, monetary policies can effectively manage the aggregate demand and fulfill the output target by adjusting money supply and credit growth, while the transmission channel through interest rates does not work effectively. Second, when monetary policies remaining neutral, macro-prudential policies can maintain financial stability as expected, and at the same time, there are little effects on real economy targets. Last, when monetary policies and macro-prudential policies are jointly implemented, a same direction policy combination can further strengthen the effect on the output target and accelerate the process towards the target. However, the same direction combination has no significant exaggerating impact on financial stability variables. In addition, we find that the same direction combination may cause counteracting effects on some target outcome variables, such as the growth rate of capital adequacy ratio and the risk-weighted asset ratio. We ascribe the counteracting effect to the argument that the same direction policy combination weakens the negative correlations between monetary policies and banks' risk-taking level.",2022,2023-02-13 13:35:21,2023-02-13 13:35:21,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,eoh,Availability Note: Information provided in collaboration with the RePEc Project: http://repec.org,EBSCOhost,,,,,,"Macroeconomic Policy, Macroeconomic Aspects of Public Finance, and General Outlook: General E60; Monetary Policy, Central Banking, and the Supply of Money and Credit: General E50; Financial Institutions and Services: Government Policy and Regulation G28",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1661,1,112,974

Secondly and relatedly they tend to focus on the crisis and post-crisis period, a time of extraordinary economic and financial dislocation, which creates counterfactual and attribution problems and fails to capture typical macroeconomic lag dynamics. Adopting the approach of Voutsinas and Werner (2010), and building on Lyonnet and Werner’s (2012) study of UK QE, this paper addresses these weaknesses by 1) examining the impact of various different monetary policy instruments (including Quantitative Easing) directly on UK nominal GDP growth; and 2) using a quarterly time series beginning in the first quarter of 1990 and up to the last quarter of 2012 (92 observations in total). We use the Hendry ‘general-to-specific’ econometric methodology to estimate a parsimonious model. The results show that disaggregated bank credit to the real economy (households and firms) has the most significant impact on nominal GDP growth. Changes to the central bank’s interest rate, central bank reserves, and total central bank asset ratios drop out of the model as insignificant.

A major implication of this result is that indirect monetary policy instruments alone were grossly inadequate measure/policy to reduce poverty in Nigeria during the period under review.

I address this question through the lens of a classic episode: the currency devaluations of the 1930s. From 1931 to 1936, many of the biggest economies in the world successively left the gold standard or devalued, leading to a depreciation of their currency by more than 30% against gold. In theory, the effect is ambiguous for countries that did not devalue: expenditure switching can lower their output, but the monetary stimulus to demand might raise it. I use cross-sectional evidence to discipline the strength of these two mechanisms in a multi-country model. This evidence comes in two forms: (i) causal inference of the effect of devaluation on country-level variables, (ii) new product-level data to estimate parameters that are essential to discipline the response of trade--the international elasticity of substitution among foreign varieties, and the pass-through of the exchange rate to international prices. Contrary to the popular narrative in modern policy debates, devaluation did not dramatically lower the output of trading partners in this context. The expenditure switching effect was mostly offset by the monetary stimulus to foreign demand. In chapter 2, Emi Nakamura, Jon Steinsson, and I provide new estimates of the evolution of productivity in England from 1250 to 1870. Real wages over this period were heavily influenced by plague-induced swings in the population. We develop and implement a new methodology for estimating productivity that accounts for these Malthusian dynamics. In the early part of our sample, we find that productivity growth was zero. Productivity growth began in 1600--almost a century before the Glorious Revolution. Post-1600 productivity growth had two phases: an initial phase of modest growth of 4% per decade between 1600 and 1810, followed by a rapid acceleration at the time of the Industrial Revolution to 18% per decade. Our evidence helps distinguish between theories of why growth began. In particular, our findings support the idea that broad-based economic change preceded the bourgeois institutional reforms of 17th century England and may have contributed to causing them. We also estimate the strength of Malthusian population forces on real wages. We find that these forces were sufficiently weak to be easily overwhelmed by post-1800 productivity growth. In chapter 3, Carlo Altavilla, Miguel Boucinha, and I propose a new methodology to identify aggregate demand and supply shocks in the bank loan market. We present a model of sticky bank-firm relationships, estimate its structural parameters in euro area credit register data, and infer aggregate shocks based on those estimates. To achieve credible identification, we leverage banks' exposure to various sectors' heterogeneous liquidity needs during the COVID-19 Pandemic. We find that developments in lending volumes following the pandemic were largely explained by demand shocks. Fluctuations in lending rates were instead mostly determined by bank-driven supply shocks and borrower risk. A by-product of our analysis is a structural interpretation of two-way fixed effects regressions in loan-level data: according to our framework, firm- and bank-time fixed effects only separate demand from supply under certain parametric assumptions. In the data, the conditions are satisfied for supply but not for demand: bank-time fixed effects identify true supply shocks up to a time constant, while firm-time fixed effects are contaminated by supply forces. Our methodology overcomes this limitation: we identify supply and demand shocks at the aggregate and individual levels. In chapter 4, I study how the fiscal side of the US government reacts to monetary policy. I estimate the response of several fiscal variables to monetary shocks. Following an interest rate hike, tax receipts fall, outlays excluding interest payments are constant, and interest payments and debt increase. The fall in output that follows a monetary tightening--not legislated changes in marginal tax rates--drives the response of receipts. The fiscal authority therefore responds passively to monetary shocks, keeping expenditures constant and letting debt adjust to satisfy its budget constraint. In heterogeneous agent models, this scenario dampens output's response to monetary policy.",2022-05,2023-02-13 13:35:30,2023-02-13 13:35:30,,,,,,,,,,,,,Columbia University,,,,,eoh,,EBSCOhost,,,,,,"Growth; Foreign Exchange F31; Macroeconomics: Production E23; Economic History: Macroeconomics and Monetary Economics; Industrial Structure; Empirical Studies of Trade F14; Economic History: Labor and Consumers, Demography, Education, Health, Welfare, Income, Wealth, Religion, and Philanthropy: Europe: Pre-1913 N33; Fluctuations: Europe: Pre-1913 N13; Economic History: Financial Markets and Institutions: General, International, or Comparative N20",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,265,1,111,983

We find that the role of international factors in explaining US variables has been changing over the 1984-2005 period. However, while some US series have become more correlated with global factors, there is little evidence suggesting that these factors have become systematically more important. We don't find strong evidence of a change in the transmission mechanism of monetary policy due to global forces. Taking our point estimates literally, global forces do not seem to have played an important role in the US monetary transmission mechanism between 1984 and 1999. In addition, since the year 2000, the initial response of the US economy following a monetary policy shock--the first 6 to 8 quarters--is essentially the same as the one that has been observed in the 1984-1999 period. However, point estimates suggest that the growing importance of global forces might have contributed to reducing some of the persistence in the responses, two or more years after the shocks.

Chapter 1: The Implications of Financial Institutions' Balance Sheets for Business Cycle Fluctuations In the first chapter, we study the implications of financial intermediaries' balance sheets for aggregate fluctuations. We extend the seminal work of Bernanke et al. (1999) by adding a verification problem between financial institutions and potential savers into their original model. This modification yields a new financial DSGE model in which the effects of both corporations' and banks' balance sheets are presented. Our numerical studies reveal that the model with a one-sided verification problem, either between corporate firms and financial institutions or between financial borrowers and their depositors, replicates the result of that with two-sided frictions. This indicates that our proposed method to unravel credit market imperfections into two types of balance sheet components may be inappropriate, and hence provides an elusive depiction of the importance of the effects of banks' balance sheets during business cycles. Finally, the paper suggests that the type of frictions that are required for modeling the joint effect of both balance sheet channels should involve endogenizing banks' capital adequacy ratio or producing cyclical variations of intermediaries' financing premium to their leverage ratio. Chapter 2: Intersectoral Linkages and the Effects of Monetary Policy The second chapter studies the dynamic responses to monetary shocks of economic activities in durable and nondurable sectors. We extend the study of Bouakez et al. (2011) by introducing the chains of investment linkages, i.e. the use of intersectoral outputs in producing investment goods in each sector. We show that the newly added ingredient can generate several patterns of sectoral responses to monetary policy shocks that are more consistent with empirical findings. Particularly, this feature can resolve the negative comovement puzzle between durable and nondurable consumption; the result arises without requiring the imperfect labor market mobility as needed in the original work of Bouakez et al. (2011), where intermediate input-output linkages only were included. Having applied our two-layer linkages model to quantify the importance of monetary factor, we find that monetary policy shocks alone can account for 16% of the volatility of real GDP in the data. Not only does this figure roughly stand in line with previous literature, but also this suggests that other types of shocks should be incorporated into a multi-sectoral DSGE model for the purpose of explaining the U.S. aggregate volatilities and business cycles. Chapter 3: Shocks and Frictions in U.S. Business Cycles: An Analysis through the Lens of a Multi-sector DSGE Model. In the third chapter, we offer empirical evidence that during the Great Moderation Era, U.S. business cycles could largely be driven by common technology shocks. Built on the two-layer intersectoral linkages model developed in chapter 2, we quantify the importance of monetary policy shocks and the total factor productivity (TFP) of durable and nondurable sectors for U.S. business cycles. The model is extended to include nominal rigidities in wage. Our study documents the exogenous variations in the three underlying disturbances using classical linear regression techniques. Exogenous disturbances to the sectoral TFPs, as obtained from the estimates of a VAR(1) model, are found to be positively correlated, and therefore cannot be directly used for a structural interpretation. Using a novel identifying method that takes into account the correlation of the two innovations in sectoral TFPs, we decompose their exogenous variations into one commonly-driven shock and two idiosyncratic shocks. The former is interpreted as common technology shocks; the latter two are interpreted as sectoral shocks. Our finding stands in opposition to other recent studies using multi-sectoral DSGE models that highlight the importance of sectoral shocks. With our proposed identification scheme, we find that sectoral shocks can account for 1/5 of the volatilities of the real GDP; the remaining 4/5 of the aggregate volatilities are explained by commonly-based factors, i.e. the combination of common technology shocks and monetary policy shocks. The result consequently calls for a reconsideration of whether the importance of sectoral shocks is robust in an alternative model's environment.",2016-08,2023-02-13 13:34:49,2023-02-13 13:34:49,,,,,,,,,,,,,University of Wisconsin,,,,,eoh,,EBSCOhost,,,,,,Business Fluctuations; Cycles E32; Monetary Policy E52; General Aggregative Models: Neoclassical E13; Diffusion Processes O33; Technological Change: Choices and Consequences; Banks; Depository Institutions; Micro Finance Institutions; Mortgages G21; Capital and Ownership Structure; Financial Risk and Risk Management; Financing Policy; Goodwill G32; Value of Firms,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,886,1,222,987

In particular, our framework features a sectorial decomposition of the productive sector, the use of intermediate inputs, imperfect pass-through, endogenous premium to finance capital accumulation, balance sheets effects due to liability dollarization, currency substitution, and price and wage rigidities. Additionally, eleven driving forces, both of domestic and international origin, are considered. While the recent literature has significantly improved our understanding of why these features are important for monetary policy, the relevance of any policy-related study strongly depends on whether the specific model (and its parameterization) used to draw recommendations is empirically sound or not. This argument is particularly relevant for these studies for several reasons. First, this line of research usually applies calibration techniques to assign values for the relevant parameters, many times using as reference studies from developed countries. Additionally, in spite of how the model is parameterized, these papers do not generally analyze if the model can adequately fit the data. Moreover, given this methodological approach, the question of which of the emerging-countries' frictions are empirically more relevant is not addressed, even though it is of great interest for policy design. Given these empirical concerns, we follow a Bayesian approach to estimate the model using a large data set from Mexico containing almost 30 year of quarterly data. Our goal is to address three main quantitative questions. First, can the estimated model fit the data? Our answer is generally yes, with some caveats. Second, are the estimated parameters similar to those calibrated in policy-related studies? The results show many significant differences, particularly for those describing financial frictions, price stickiness and money demand. Finally, which of the emerging-markets' frictions are more relevant in fitting the data? We found that including intermediate inputs is most relevant, while currency substitution does not seem to play a relevant role. Moreover, the financial accelerator mechanism and liability dollarization are also important. Additionally, we use our preferred specifications to study which of the included driving forces are more important in explaining the data. We found that, while foreign shocks play a non-negligible role (especially export prices), the most important sources of fluctuations have a domestic origin. In particular, sectorial (stationary) technology shocks account for more than 40% of the variance of most domestic observables. Country premium disturbances are also relevant to explain real variables, while shocks related with monetary policy shocks are mostly helpful in describing the dynamics of inflation. From a methodological perspective, we depart from the usual implementation of Bayesian estimation of DSGE models in two aspects. First, we modify the methodology proposed by Del Negro and Schorfheide (2006) to assign priors for the estimated parameters, providing a more transparent procedure of translating our a priori beliefs into a probability density (particularly for parameters describing driving forces). Second, in addition to the usual model comparison using the marginal likelihood, we perform a more thorough analysis by applying the loss function-based approach developed by Schorfheide (2000), which allows ranking models according to their ability to fit the data in many different dimensions.",2009-05,2023-02-13 13:34:57,2023-02-13 13:34:57,,,,,,,,,,,,,Duke University,,,,,eoh,,EBSCOhost,,,,,,Monetary Policy E52; Fiscal and Monetary Policy in Development O23; Model Construction and Estimation C51,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1062,1,221,988

We think that such a question is particularly relevant in the monetary literature, as frictions are often introduced under the form of a one-period lag in agents' reaction. We first show that it is possible to use more efficiently the available information when identifying monetary policy shocks. Using together quarterly series for GDP and monthly series for monetary aggregates and interest rates, it is possible to identify monetary shocks with the assumption that they do not have any impact on GDP within a month, by restricting ourselves to the identification of third-month-of-a-quarter shocks. With this new method, we obtain very similar estimated IRFs, as compared with the results obtained with quarterly data, although the price puzzle appears to be more pronounced in our estimates. Such a similarity is a new fact that quantitative models need to match. In the second part of the Paper, we propose a model-based explanation for this result, by computing a limited participation model predictions, when the time period is reduced from one quarter to one month, and when the model predictions are time-aggregated at the quarterly frequency. We show that the introduction of adjustment costs to portfolio reallocation into the model is not only improving its fit, but is necessary for obtaining qualitatively realistic predictions, when the length of the period is thought to be the month and not the quarter.",2004,2023-02-13 13:34:55,2023-02-13 13:34:55,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,eoh,Availability Note: Information provided in collaboration with the RePEc Project: http://repec.org,EBSCOhost,,,,,,"Monetary Policy, Central Banking, and the Supply of Money and Credit: General E50; Money and Interest Rates: General E40",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1032,1,221,989

First, they violate the exogeneity condition as they capture the Bank's endogenous response to credit market spreads motivated by the predictive information for inflation in those spreads. Second, they are anticipated by financial market participants and hence give rise to the issue of non-fundamentalness in SVAR models. I will explore the relevance of these two issues in turn. In the first step, I will assess the effects of monetary policy when estimated using the residuals from the Taylor-type policy rule augmented by credit spreads (regression BT-CS of Table 1) as my monetary policy shock series. These ‘first-stage’ residuals are independent of the Bank's response to financial market conditions but are still anticipated to some extent as shown in Section 3.2 (Table 3; Figure 5). In the second step, I will then remove this anticipatory component from these ‘first-stage’ residuals by purging them of the expected cash rate change by financial market participants (Table 3). At each step, I will estimate the effects of monetary policy on the variables of interest in a simple SVAR with four lags similar to RR, Coibion (2012) and BT. Accordingly, the VAR includes (log) underlying CPI, (log) real GDP, the unemployment rate and a measure of the policy shock, in that order. Here, the policy shock replaces the cash rate typically included to measure the stance of monetary policy. Since the cash rate is typically included in levels, I cumulate the quarterly shock series over time. The ordering imposes the typical recursive identifying assumption that changes in the policy rate do not affect any macroeconomic variables within the same quarter.",2020,2023-03-16 15:40:45,2023-03-16 15:40:45,1678282264.0,,,January,,,,"The Effects of Monetary Policy Shocks on Inflation, Unemployment and Output | RDP 2020-01",,,,,,,en-AU,,,,Australia,www.rba.gov.au,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,8352,1,221,990

Using a Factor-Augmented Vector Autoregression (FAVAR) model on an expanded dataset, including sectoral balance sheet variables, we show that the balance sheets of various economic agents act as important links in the monetary policy transmission mechanism and affect the impulse response of inflation, output, and unemployment. Balance sheets of financial intermediaries, such as commercial banks, asset-backed-security issuers and, to a lesser extent, security brokers and dealers, shrink in response to monetary tightening, while money market fund assets grow. However, their economic significance in the run-up to the recent financial crisis was small. Furthermore, judging from the magnitude of the interest rate elasticity of house price changes, it seems that large increases in interest rates would have been needed to avert a rapid rise of house prices and an unsustainable increase in leverage.

The Classical quantity theory of money, the Cambridge Cash Balanced, the liquidity preference theory and the Monetarists as theoretical frameworks were explored to appreciate the time trends of the selected variables on the economic growth of the CEMAC zone. Based on the (VAR) methodology, the study reveals that key monetary policy variables influence economic growth of the CEMAC zone in different ways with inflation rate as the impact factor. On the basis of the above findings and the evidence from other studies, lending and inflation rate generated substantial destabilizing impacts on the economic growth, suggesting that the monetary authorities should play a critical role in creating an enabling environment for growth. The determination of the optimal lending rate should reflect the overall internal rate of returns in the productive sectors with due attention to market fundamentals.

Impulse response analysis and estimation of an interest rate augmented Phillips curve in Korea indicate the existence of a cost channel eﬀect of monetary policy before the currency crisis period. Based upon these empirical results, this paper develops a dynamic stochastic general equilibrium model in order to explain the price responses in Korea. The cost channel of monetary policy transmission is a key feature in the model. Moreover, in order to examine the role of the banking sector in the monetary policy transmission given cost channel, an explicit loan production function in the banking sector is introduced. I ﬁnd from policy simulation that the cost channel eﬀect of monetary policy has fallen dramatically since the currency crisis in 1997. The model suggests that this result comes mainly from the facts that it takes longer for ﬁrms to adjust their output prices, and that the capital adjustment cost has declined since the currency crisis. I also ﬁnd that, despite the existence of the cost channel, when the banking sector supplies loans eﬃciently, monetary policy has an eﬀect on the economy mainly through the changing of aggregate demand. This implies that, given the existence of the cost channel, the central bank can reduce undesirable output price movements by enhancing the eﬃciency of the banking sector.",,2023-03-16 15:35:32,2023-03-16 15:35:32,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,en,,,,,Zotero,,,,,http://www.kmfa.or.kr/paper/annual/2008/2008_10.pdf,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,7041,1,112,995

The sample consists of Annual data ranging from 1990 to 2018. The GARCH process is used in empirical work to correct for potential autoregressive conditional heteroscedasticity. Results - Expansionary fiscal policy reduces output; whereas, expansionary monetary policy raises output. In addition, real appreciation of the Australian dollar, a lower U.S. interest rate, a higher real stock price or a lower expected inflation would increase output. The finding that expansionary fiscal policy has a negative impact on real GDP suggests that the negative crowding-out effect on private spending dominates the positive impact. Conclusions - Fiscal prudence needs to be pursued. Real depreciation of the Australian dollar hurts output. Monetary tightening in the U.S. generates a negative effect on Australia's output.

To measure these effects at high frequencies, we propose a novel mixed frequency vector autoregressive (MF-VAR) model. This model allows us to combine weekly and monthly information within a unified framework. Our model combines a set of macroeconomic aggregates such as industrial production, unemployment rates, and inflation with high-frequency information from financial markets such as stock prices, interest rate spreads, and weekly information on the Fed's balance sheet size. The latter set of high-frequency time series is used to dynamically interpolate the monthly time series to obtain weekly macroeconomic measures.

For the former case, there is no significant evidence of a relationship of short-run movements of M1 on real growth and employment. There exists, however, some indication of an impact of changes in M1 upon the interest rates. Regarding the effect of changes, there is an asymmetric impact upon real activity when a two-period lag is used. Regarding monetary policy, these results imply the following: Monetary shocks are an important source of pressure on the aggregate demand; monetary policy may contribute to economic growth through smoothing the impact of monetary shocks; interest rates may become leading indicators of price variations; and finally, pressure groups may be interested in looking for reductions of interest rates.

Moreover, while in the short run asymmetries in the output responses arise mainly due to cross-country differences in industry mix, in the medium run differences in financial structure and labor market rigidities are more important.

There is, however, considerable cross‐industry heterogeneity in both the overall policy effects and the degree of asymmetry across the two business cycle phases. We then explore which industry characteristics can account for this cross‐industry heterogeneity. Differences in the overall policy effects can mainly be explained by the durability of the goods produced in the sector. This can be regarded as evidence for the conventional interest rate/cost‐of‐capital channel. In contrast, differences in the degree of asymmetry of policy effects are related to differences in financial structure, in particular the maturity structure of debt, the coverage ratio, financial leverage and firm size.

For that purpose, assuming that the interest rate is determined by means of the Taylor rule, the changes in interest rate were decomposed into anticipated and surprise components. NARDL enables us to observe the asymmetric effects of monetary policy in terms of the size of shocks and the stance of the shocks. The findings of this study support the idea that, in Turkey, while unanticipated monetary policy shocks have symmetric effects on production, their effects on inflation are asymmetric. Regarding the direction of the policy, positive and negative interest rate changes exert a significant positive effect on inflation. Regarding the size of monetary policy, only big shocks have a considerable effect on inflation. Augmented central bank reaction function with asymmetric relationship might enrich information for policymakers and improve the effectiveness of monetary policy.

We incorporate the shadow short rate in a standard vector autoregressive analysis to study the effects of monetary policy shocks both at the level of the Euro area and for two periphery EA countries, Italy and Spain, that endured significant financial stress during the crisis. Our analysis shows that monetary policy shocks identified form the SSR produce similar macro responses as shocks identified from the standard policy rate. The Euro area shocks can directly translate to a corresponding change in the country-specific financing conditions in the periphery, whereas the reverse effect is limited.

We answer this question by estimating the impact of a monetary policy shock on private-sector leverage and the likelihood of a financial crisis. Impulse responses obtained from a panel VAR model of eighteen advanced countries suggest that the debt-to-GDP ratio rises in the short run following an unexpected tightening in monetary policy. As a consequence, the likelihood of a financial crisis increases, as estimated from a panel logit regression. However, in the long run, output recovers and higher borrowing costs discourage new lending, leading to a deleveraging of the private sector. A lower debt-to-GDP ratio in turn reduces the likelihood of a financial crisis. These results suggest that monetary policy can achieve a less risky financial system in the long run but could fuel financial instability in the short run. We also find that the ultimate effects of a monetary policy tightening on the probability of a financial crisis depend on the leverage of the private sector: the higher the initial value of the debt-to-GDP ratio, the more beneficial the monetary policy intervention in the long run, but the more destabilizing in the short run.",2017-09,2023-02-13 13:37:32,2023-02-13 13:37:32,,40-pages,,Query date: 2023-02-07 15:13:56,13,,International Journal of Central Banking,,,,,,,,,,,eoh,Availability Note: Information provided in collaboration with the RePEc Project: http://repec.org,EBSCOhost,,,,,,Business Fluctuations; Cycles E32; Macroeconomics: Production E23; Monetary Policy E52; Financial Crises G01; Financial Markets and the Macroeconomy E44; Central Banks and Their Policies E58; Spatial Models; Treatment Effect Models; Single Equation Models; Single Variables: Panel Data Models; Spatio-temporal Models C23; Quantile Regressions C21; Single Variables: Cross-Sectional Models,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,4640,1,222,1035

This framework allows us to estimate stationary and non-stationary common factors and idiosyncratic components, to identify the structural shocks behind the common factors and assess their transmission to individual EMU countries. Our most important findings are the following. EMU countries share five common trends. However, the source of non-stationarity of individual countries' key macroeconomic variables is not only pervasive. Instead, most countries' output and inflation are also affected by long-lasting idiosyncratic shocks. Unweighted dispersion is primarily due to idiosyncratic shocks rather than the asymmetric spread of common shocks. However, the latter seems to be the main driving force of weighted dispersion of output at the end of the 1980s and the beginning of the 1990s and again from 1999 on and of inflation in the mid-1980s and the mid-1990s. To examine the transmission of common shocks to individual EMU countries in more detail, we identify five structural common shocks, namely two euro-area supply shocks, one euro-area demand shock, one common monetary policy shock and a US shock.

We document that there is a large heterogeneity across sectors in the reaction to monetary policy shocks and show that sectors with larger volatility of idiosyncratic shocks react more readily to monetary policy. This finding stands in contrast to the rational inattention model of price setting. We also find that sectors, which change prices infrequently, react less strongly but if they do change their prices, they adjust them by a large amount. This suggests that the source of sluggish response to aggregate shocks is heterogeneity in menu costs rather than rational inattention. Furthermore, even though prices respond with a significant delay to identified monetary policy shocks, we find no evidence of a price puzzle on average.

However, interest rate has a negative effect statistically insignificant at 5% level of significance. That is to say as Money increases also GDP increases, however, increase in interest rate reduces GDP. This is because investments rely on the rate of interest, High interest rate makes borrowing expensive to the investor. Thus reduced investments leads to reduced GDP. The government should explore rational mechanisms of stimulating increased demand through money supply since it has emerged as a key element that promotes economic growth.

This paper investigates asymmetries in the response of output to monetary policy shocks of different magnitude. Traditionally in the literature, the threshold determining which shocks are 'large' and which are 'small' has been imposed exogenously. To the extent that such a threshold is misspecified, tests for asymmetry will have low power. In this context, an unobserved components (UC) model of output with a TAR-driven transitory component augmented by a monetary policy variable is estimated. This framework makes it possible to introduce the threshold determining the size of monetary policy shocks as an additional parameter, instead of imposing an ad hoc definition. When the threshold is estimated from the data, there is strong statistical evidence that the response of output to monetary shocks of different sizes behaves asymmetrically. By contrast, when the threshold is imposed to be one standard deviation, linearity cannot be rejected. Moreover, the results found show some support for the implications of menu-cost models: smaller monetary shocks trigger a larger response on output. Second Chapter: ""Fiducial Distribution Confidence Intervals for Threshold Models with an Application to Credit-Market Crises"" (with Yunjong Eo and James Morley) We construct confidence intervals for threshold parameters of TAR processes. While there have been important advances in the asymptotic theory for inference in TAR models, their small sample properties have received much less attention. In this context, following Eo and Morley (2009), we propose a new method to construct confidence intervals for threshold parameters based on simulation of their marginal fiducial distributions (FD) from the likelihood function, by means of Markov-Chain Monte Carlo methods. Based on Monte Carlo experiments, we find that the FD confidence intervals for the threshold parameter have more accurate coverage rates and shorter expected length in comparison to bootstrap and asymptotic methods, even in small samples. We apply our method to a TAR model of the U.S. real GDP growth rate where the dynamics depend on whether credit conditions are tight or loose. Using our marginal FD approach, we find much tighter 95% confidence intervals for the threshold parameter that support the idea that recessions produced by credit crises exhibit largely transitory effects on the level of output. Third Chapter: ""Firm Heterogeneity, Imperfect Information and the Role of Aggregation in the Nonlinear Relationship Between Money and Output"" This paper addresses deeper empirical issues related to the role of aggregation in determining the nature of the nonlinear relationship between output and monetary policy variables. The results in Donayre (2009) support the notion that 'small' monetary shocks have larger effects on output than large shocks. However, the response of output associated with 'large' monetary shocks is not neutral as implied by menu-cost models. Thus, this paper argues that this difference between theory and empirical evidence might be caused by an aggregation problem. At the aggregate level, a particular monetary shock might be deemed small by some firms and large by others. That is, the response of output to monetary shocks is an average of the individual responses of firms and, as a consequence, that response is likely to capture the heterogeneity of behaviors. Moreover, when firms adjust their prices, they do not necessarily achieve the optimal price level, since they may face imperfect information. Based on this evidence, and using Markov-Chain Monte Carlo methods, an unobserved components model in which the transitory component is driven by a smooth transition autoregressive (STAR) process is estimated to account for the possibility of multiple (or a continuum of) thresholds, reflecting the heterogeneity of firms in the economy. A Bayesian estimation of TAR-driven and STAR-driven transitory components allows for a formal comparison of both processes and helps determining which one describes the nonlinear relationship between output and money better (Koop and Potter 1999, 2004).",2010-05,2023-02-13 13:34:53,2023-02-13 13:34:53,,,,,,,,,,,,,Washington University in St. Louis,,,,,eoh,,EBSCOhost,,,,,,Macroeconomics: Production E23; Monetary Policy E52; Financial Markets and the Macroeconomy E44; Estimation: General C13,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,985,1,221,1062

The paper tests whether these variables are good predictors of output, and whether responses to shocks to these variables broadly conform to the implications of the monetary transmission model, over two periods between 1960 and 1992. In the earlier period when Japan's financial markets were less developed, a monetary aggregate (M2 [plus] CDs) is a relatively useful indicator of monetary policy whereas an interest rate variable is not. In particular, we find some evidence of a ""liquidity effect"" in response to innovations in money. Neither variable is an entirely satisfactory indicator of monetary policy in the second sample.

More importantly, central banks adjust policy in response to a wide range of information about future economic developments. As a result, estimates of the effects of monetary policy derived using conventional measures will tend to be biased. To address this problem, we develop a new measure of monetary policy shocks in the United States for the period 1969 to 1996 that is relatively free of endogenous and anticipatory movements. The derivation of the new measure has two key elements. First, to address the problem of forward-looking behavior, we control for the Federal Reserve's forecasts of output and inflation prepared for scheduled FOMC meetings. We remove from our measure policy actions that are a systematic response to the Federal Reserve's anticipations of future developments. Second, to address the problem of endogeneity and to ensure that the forecasts capture the main information the Federal Reserve had at the times decisions were made, we consider only changes in the Federal Reserve's intentions for the federal funds rate around scheduled FOMC meetings. This series on intended changes is derived using information on the expected funds rate from the records of the Open Market Manager and information on intentions from the narrative records of FOMC meetings. The series covers the entire period for which forecasts are available, including times when the Federal Reserve was not exclusively targeting the funds rate. Estimates of the effects of monetary policy obtained using the new measure indicate that policy has large, relatively rapid, and statistically significant effects on both output and inflation. We find that the effects using the new measure are substantially stronger and quicker than those using prior measures. This suggests that previous measures of policy shocks are significantly contaminated by forward-looking Federal Reserve behavior and endogeneity.",2004-09,2023-02-13 13:34:55,2023-02-13 13:34:55,,1055-1084,,4,94,,American Economic Review,,,,,,,,,,,eoh,Availability Note: Information provided in collaboration with the RePEc Project: http://repec.org,EBSCOhost,,,,,,Business Fluctuations; Cycles E32; Monetary Policy E52; Central Banks and Their Policies E58,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1020,1,111,1065

It is important to study the effectiveness of interest rates also in light of future reforms of the monetary policy tools in China.

In a benchmark full participation model, the effect of a contractionary shock on output is strongest in the impact period and decays over time. When some households do not participate in financial markets, however, the shock has an additional liquidity effect, it increases the real interest rate, and it decreases the growth rate of the participants' labor supply. As a result, the trough of the equilibrium aggregate labor and output response occurs after several quarters. The model is able to replicate the sign, the magnitude and the persistence of the responses of output, money, and interest rates. Abstract: In the data, after a contractionary monetary policy shock aggregate output decreases over time, with a trough after four to eight quarters. This paper replicates the 'hump-shaped' response of output with a segmented markets model where part of the households are excluded from financial markets. A contractionary monetary policy shock is modeled as an unanticipated increase in the short-term nominal interest rate. Since households and firms need cash-in-advance to purchase consumption and hire labor, an increase in the nominal interest rate discourages the households' consumption demand and labor supply, and the firms' labor demand. In a benchmark full participation model, the effect is strongest in the impact period, and decays over time. When markets are segmented, however, the shock has an additional liquidity effect, increasing the real interest rate above fundamentals, and decreasing the growth rate of the participants' labor supply. As a result, the response of the aggregate labor and output has a trough several quarters after the shock. The model is able to replicate the sign, the magnitude and the persistence of the responses of output, money, prices and interest rates. It can generate a positive response of the real interest rate together with a negative response of the output growth rate.",2004,2023-02-13 13:34:59,2023-02-13 13:34:59,,20-pages,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,eoh,Availability Note: Information provided in collaboration with the RePEc Project: http://repec.org,EBSCOhost,,,,,,Monetary Policy E52,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1091,1,222,1084

Our measures of contractionary monetary policy shocks have the following properties: (i) they are associated with a fall in nonborrowed reserves, total reserves, M1, the Federal Reserves' holdings of government securities and a rise in the federal funds rate, (ii) they lead to persistent declines in real GNP, employment, retail sales and nonfinancial corporate profits as well as increases in unemployment and manufacturing inventories, (iii) they generate sharp, persistent declines in commodity prices and (iv) the GDP price deflator does not respond to them for roughly a year. After that the GDP price deflator declines. Our major findings regarding the borrowing activities of different sectors can be summarized as follows. First, following a contractionary shock to monetary policy, net funds raised by the business sector increases for roughly a year. Thereafter, as the recession induced by the policy shock gains momentum, net funds raised by the business sector begins to fall.

Central banks employ a variety of measures to influence the investors, borrowers, and businesses through the money supply in the economy. The effectiveness of these policies depends on their suitability to the circumstances and situations. This study analyses the monetary policy responses of the four emerging market economies namely Brazil, Russia, India, and South Africa during the global financial crisis of 2008 and the economic crisis created by the COVID 19 pandemic with an aim to understand their short-term effects on inflation in terms of QGDP deflator. Additionally, it also draws a cross country comparison between these responses. The effect of the crisis during each quarter is quantified in terms of QGDP growth rate, which is used as the context for the monetary policy response measures taken during the crises. The monetary policy measures are then evaluated by analyzing its short-term effect on prices in the economy using percentage change in QGDP deflator. Thereafter, the monetary policy response measures of the four selected countries are compared against each other. The comparison is drawn on the basis of the QGDP deflator (% change) indicator in order to compare the effectiveness of the policy measures for both crises separately. The findings of the study provide primary evidence that the advent of unconventional monetary policy measures have expanded the scope of monetary policy in the emerging market economies. The wide combination of policy tools can be used to effectively injecting liquidity and expand the money supply to an extent significant enough to accelerate rapid recovery in short term.",2021-05-27,2023-03-16 15:34:43,2023-03-16 15:34:43,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,ResearchGate,,,,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Sivapriya_Kamath/publication/366588529_MONETARY_POLICY_RESPONSES_OF_CENTRAL_BANKS_IN_TIMES_OF_CRISES_-GLOBAL_FINANCIAL_CRISIS_Vs_COVID_19_With_reference_to_Brazil_Russia_India_China_and_South_Africa/links/63a948b403aad5368e3f8e91/MONETARY-POLICY-RESPONSES-OF-CENTRAL-BANKS-IN-TIMES-OF-CRISES-GLOBAL-FINANCIAL-CRISIS-Vs-COVID-19-With-reference-to-Brazil-Russia-India-China-and-South-Africa.pdf,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,6818,1,221,1097

We show that an expansionary monetary policy shock has large positive effects on output and inflation during the acute phase of a financial crisis. These effects are larger than those during non-crisis periods. Decreased uncertainty as well as increases in consumer confidence and share prices explain these large effects, whereas these variables are much less relevant for monetary policy transmission outside financial crises. Counterfactual analysis shows that the transmission mechanism would be impaired without the effects of monetary policy on these variables, where credit would not react at all and the response of output would be substantially lower.

Our identification uses sign restrictions on survey forecasts incorporated in a structural VAR model to isolate expected deviations from the monetary policy rule. We find that expectations of future policy easing that materialize over the subsequent four quarters--similar to those generated by credible forward guidance--have immediate and persistent stimulative effects on output, inflation and employment. The effects are larger than those produced by an identical shift in the policy path that is not anticipated. Our results are broadly consistent with the mechanism underlying forward guidance in New Keynesian models, but they suggest that those models overstate the persistence of the inflation response.

The effect of an announced increase in the policy rate on inflation expectations is significant and positive. According to the New-Keynesian model, the effect of an exogenous monetary policy shock depends on the assumptions made on the persistence of the shock process in the model.

The simultaneity problem can only be addressed if one has a valid instrument for monetary policy.

Although the news shocks literature often concentrates on news about future technological changes, we on the other hand study news about a country interest rate and a monetary policy interest rate in the context of small open economies (SOEs). Country interest rate news shocks refer to the anticipated changes in the rate at which the SOE borrows/lends in the international financial markets. Monetary policy news on the other hand refers to the anticipated changes of the policy rate usually transmitted to the public through ""forward guidance."" We argue that such pieces of news about interest rates change the expectations of economic agents and influence current economic activity without any actual change ever occurring. Further, we extend our SOE framework to study an optimal monetary policy rule for Canada. In Chapter 2, we examine how anticipated changes in future country interest rates influence the business cycles of emerging SOEs like Argentina and Mexico. To this end, we introduce country interest rate news shocks in a SOE model. We use annual Argentine data from 1900-2005 to estimate our model using Bayesian methods. We find that anticipated shocks to country interest rates explain a good deal of variations in the growth rate of investment and trade balance-output ratio of Argentina. The model also generates business cycles statistics that are consistent with those of Argentina. We find similar results for Mexico as well. In Chapter 3, we extend our SOE framework of Chapter 2 to a New Keynesian SOE model in order to explore the role of monetary policy news shocks in Canadian business cycles. Once again, we perform a Bayesian estimation of the model with Canadian and US data from 1981Q3-2012Q4. The novel feature of the monetary policy rule employed in this study is the inclusion of US interest rate deviations in the Canadian monetary policy rule motivated by the highly correlated US and Canadian short term nominal interest rates over the above mentioned time period. Our estimation results show that the response coefficient of Canadian monetary policy to US interest rate deviations is indeed positive. Moreover, both the unconditional and conditional variance decomposition of variables in the model reveal that although monetary policy news shocks explain some of the variation in the growth rate of output and consumption, overall they are not a major source of Canadian business cycles. However, they explain a good portion of the variation in money supply growth and inflation in Canada. Chapter 4 builds on the New Keynesian Dynamic Stochastic General Equilibrium (DSGE) framework developed in Chapter 3. In this chapter, we ask the following question: does reacting to US interest rate changes help the central bank achieve its mandate? To this end, we represent the mandate of the central bank by a loss function which is a linear combination of the variances of inflation, output gap and nominal interest rate changes which the central bank seeks to minimize. The weights attached to each of the three terms of the loss function represent different policy regimes. We assess the performance of the estimated interest rate rule of Chapter 3 with and without reaction to US interest rate deviations in achieving the central bank's mandate under different policy regimes. We find that under the estimated rule, reacting to US interest rate deviations neither helps nor hurts the central bank to achieve its mandate. Next, we ask the following questions: what values of the policy coefficients would minimize the loss function and would the optimal simple rule include US interest rate deviations in it? We find that the optimal rule has a positive coefficient on US interest rate deviations (larger than its Bayesian estimate) for all the policy regimes. It also has a large coefficient on inflation. Therefore, our analysis suggests that the central bank should include US interest rate deviations in its reaction function and should react even more aggressively to US interest rate changes and inflation than it did based on our Bayesian estimates.",2018-06,2023-02-13 13:36:11,2023-02-13 13:36:11,,,,,,,,,,,,,McMaster University,,,,,eoh,,EBSCOhost,,,,,,"Business Fluctuations; Cycles E32; Interest Rates: Determination, Term Structure, and Effects E43; General Aggregative Models: Keynes; Keynesian; Post-Keynesian E12; Macroeconomic Analyses of Economic Development O11; Fiscal and Monetary Policy in Development O23",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2849,1,221,1125

The results show that the responses of the Canadian macro variables to the US monetary policy shock are very similar to the responses of the US macro variables to the same shock: after a contractionary US monetary policy shock, output falls quickly and shows a U-shaped response, inflation falls with a delay, short-term interest rate jumps and then gradually declines and long-term interest rate increases for one year and then gradually declines. Our results show that interest rate-path-through is the major mechanism by which US monetary policy shocks are transmitted into the Canadian economy.",2015-04,2023-02-13 13:34:40,2023-02-13 13:34:40,,11-26,,,46,,Economic Modelling,,,,,,,,,,,eoh,,EBSCOhost,,,,,,"Inflation; Business Fluctuations; Cycles E32; Deflation E31; Interest Rates: Determination, Term Structure, and Effects E43; Monetary Policy E52; Price Level",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,668,1,221,1131

In our analysis, the international transmission mechanism works through movements in the exchange rate, commodity prices, short-term interest rates and the trade balance. We find that an increase in the federal funds rate causes the euro to immediately depreciate, while commodity, and in particular oil, prices decline sharply, reflecting a decline in demand. Lower commodity prices stimulate household consumption in the short run, and the higher aggregate demand induces an expansion of eurozone economic activity. Our results show that the effects of changes in the federal funds rate on commodity prices are greater than previously found in the literature. Our analysis also assesses the likely effects on the eurozone economy of the European Central Bank's (ECB's) own responses to macroeconomic developments. We find that the expansionary effect of lower commodity prices and a depreciated euro on the eurozone economy is partially offset by the ECB increasing short-term nominal interest rates to curb inflationary pressures in an expanding economy. This result highlights the importance of commodity prices and the euro–dollar exchange rate as inputs into European monetary policy-making, as seen, for example, in the Eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections used by the Governing Council to assess the risks to price stability.",2010,2023-03-16 15:47:50,2023-03-16 15:47:50,1678461639.0,55-78,,1,13,,,,,,,,,,en,,,,,Wiley Online Library,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,10164,1,222,1132

The success of the Kim and Roubini model across these economies makes it a natural starting point to analyse monetary policy in Australia. Consistent with Kim and Roubini, we find no evidence of the price or exchange rate puzzles identified in the literature. We demonstrate that, in the Australian context, modelling the interdependence between the domestic interest rate, the foreign interest rate and the nominal exchange rate is critical to resolving these puzzles. Further, we demonstrate that the Kim and Roubini model can be further usefully refined when applied to the Australian data. We use the model to perform various monetary policy experiments and the results of these experiments accord well with both the existing SVAR literature and previous empirical work for Australia. We find that monetary policy shocks have a delayed and gradual effect on the price level and a small temporary effect on output. We also use the model to examine the effects of shocks to the Australian economy and the role of monetary policy in response to these shocks.

Policy first affects inflation after a year, with a peak effect about 1½ years after the interest rate rise. In the long run, however, monetary policy has no effects on the real economy.

However, the current study's analysis of the period after the global financial crisis determines that the spillover effect on price is inaccurately measured. Meanwhile, the expenditure-switching effect, which refers to the appreciation of the US dollar following an interest rate hike leading to depreciation in other currencies, thereby improving trade balance, is not considerably large. That is, the income-absorption effect (i.e., decrease in US imports owing to reduced domestic demand) or increase in world interest rate appears stronger than the expenditure-switching effect.

Yet, empirical studies of monetary policy have typically found exchange rate effects that are inconsistent with overshooting. This puzzling result has been viewed by some researchers as a “stylized fact” to be reckoned with in policy modelling. However, many of these studies, in particular those using vector autoregressive (VARs) approaches, have disregarded the strong contemporaneous interaction between monetary policy and exchange rate movements by placing zero restrictions on them. In contrast, we achieve identification by imposing a long-run neutrality restriction on the real exchange rate, thereby allowing for contemporaneous interaction between the interest rate and the exchange rate. In a study of four open economies, we find that the puzzles disappear. In particular, a contractionary monetary policy shock has a strong effect on the exchange rate, which appreciates on impact. The maximum effect occurs within 1–2 quarters, and the exchange rate thereafter gradually depreciates to baseline, consistent with the Dornbusch overshooting hypothesis and with few exceptions consistent with uncovered interest parity (UIP).",2009-09-01,2023-03-16 15:45:59,2023-03-16 15:45:59,1678446060.0,64-77,,1,79,,Journal of International Economics,Monetary policy and exchange rate overshooting,,,,,,,en,,,,,ScienceDirect,,,,,,Monetary policy; Exchange rate; Dornbusch overshooting; Structural vector autoregressive (VAR); Uncovered interest parity (UIP),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,9772,1,222,1152

To see if this is the case, we combine the local projection method of Jordà (2005) with shadow rates to estimate macroeconomic effects of monetary policy shocks during the implementation period of UMP, and test if effects of these shocks with the same magnitude differ across periods or states of the economy, using Japan’s data from the 1980s to 2016. We find that monetary policy shocks during the implementation period of the UMP had statistically significant expansionary effects on the economy. We also find that an unexpected 100 basis point cut in shadow rates during the UMP yielded larger expansionary effects on key economic variables than it did during the conventional monetary policy (CMP), because of the following three reasons: (i) A cut in the shadow rates resulted in a larger reduction in the real interest rate, and affected a wider range of borrowing rates during the UMP; (ii) The effectiveness of monetary policy shocks was dampened when the financial system was significantly impaired, particularly during the CMP; (iii) Other things being equal, the effectiveness has been so far little affected by the level of policy rate. Our results show that UMP has been effective, but that the nature of monetary transmission is subject to change depending on financial conditions or other economic circumstances, and therefore monetary policy needs to be carefully implemented. Note also that our study only explores the effects of a one-unit shock to the monetary policy rule, and does not address the entire effects of monetary easing that are affected by the size of shocks as well.",,2023-03-16 15:34:42,2023-03-16 15:34:42,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,en,,,,,Zotero,,,,,https://www.boj.or.jp/en/research/wps_rev/wps_2017/data/wp17e11.pdf,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,6811,1,221,1167

It is a country-specific, time series study that verifies the implication of increasing economic openness on the efficacy of monetary and fiscal policy. A modified GARCH model was used to estimate the anticipated and unanticipated shocks. Two measures of fiscal and monetary shocks were combined with openness and real oil price shocks in a VECM model to assess the effects of anticipated and unanticipated policy shocks on the output equations. The empirical results showed that anticipated and unanticipated fiscal and monetary shocks had no significant positive effects on real output. This suggests that the open macroeconomic version of the policy ineffectiveness proposition was valid for both monetary and fiscal policy shocks in Nigeria. This is in consonance with earlier works in this area. Furthermore, the degree of openness and oil price shocks had a negative implication on the efficacy of macroeconomic policy in Nigeria; also in agreement with the Dutch Disease Syndrome. Finally, the policy implication of this study therefore is that trade liberalization policy should be implemented cautiously. The Nigerian economy is weak to withstand the unwholesome consequences of full economic integration.",2008,2023-03-16 15:45:45,2023-03-16 15:45:45,1678406400.0,529-548,,3,20,,,,,,,,,,en,,,,,Wiley Online Library,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,730,1,221,1172

Contractionary monetary policy shocks increase expenditure and consumption inequality, whereas income and earnings inequality are less affected. Adverse aggregate supply and demand shocks increase income and earnings inequality, but reduce expenditure and consumption inequality. Our results suggest that different channels dominate in the transmission of the shocks. The earnings heterogeneity channel is consistent with the inequality dynamics after monetary policy shocks, but it appears to be less crucial when the economy is hit by either aggregate supply or aggregate demand shocks.

The existence of a long lag can mean that monetary policy does the opposite of what it is expected to do, that is, it may stimulate the economy when it is over heated and dampen it when it is recession, in effect making things worse rather than better. The problem of lag is further made difficult by the fact that the lag can be variable meaning that it can be of uncertain length. It is in this respect that this study empirically evaluates the lags in the effect of monetary policy in Nigeria using monetary growth model of aggregate demand. Secondary (quarterly) data covering the period 1986 to 1998 were used. The results of the study confirmed the notion that monetary policy affects its ultimate target after a lag, which is both long and variable. The existence of a long and variable lag suggests that government monetary policy should not attempt to be actively anti-cyclical but should behave in a manner that is cyclically neutral, also since monetary transmission mechanism plays a major role as far as the timing of monetary policy is concerned and so because of its important role, government should put in place more efficient financial structures to ensure that the transmission mechanisms is hitch free.",2005,2023-03-16 15:47:32,2023-03-16 15:47:32,1678460132.0,39-57,,1,43,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,JSTOR,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,10024,1,221,1186

In this study, we hypothesize that the apparent weak relationship between money and the target variables, found in empirical literature, is predominantly due to the absence of asset prices in the empirical models (see for instance, Bernanke and Blinder, 1992). We test our hypothesis using data of the Pakistan economy over the period 1981 Q1 to 2018 Q2. We compare the forecasting power of interest rate with that of money stock for goods prices and real economic activity in the presence of asset prices. This has been done using Granger causality test and by decomposing variances of the GDP deflator rate and output. In both cases, the predictive power of money, for the prices and output, significantly increases when asset prices are considered in the model. Moreover, as a second objective, we also find out the moderating role that asset prices play in strengthening or weakening the relationship between money and the target variables. This has been done using two different methods; the two steps regression based method and by incorporating an interaction term of asset prices and money in the regressions of the target variables. In both cases, we find evidence of asset prices affecting the relationship between money and the target variables. More specifically, the asset prices proved to weaken the relationship between money and price level and strengthen the relationship between money and the economic activity.",,2023-03-16 15:34:58,2023-03-16 15:34:58,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,en,,,,,Zotero,,,,,http://pu.edu.pk/images/journal/pesr/PDF-FILES/3-v59_2_21.pdf,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,6864,1,111,1190

In the first essay, I analyze how the information contained in the disaggregate components of aggregate inflation helps improve the forecasts of the aggregate series using inflation data from Ghana. Direct univariate forecasting of the aggregate inflation data by an autoregressive (AR) model is used as the benchmark with which all autoregressive (AR), moving average (MA) and vector autoregressive (VAR) models of the disaggregates are compared. The results show that directly forecasting the aggregate series from the benchmark model is generally superior to aggregating forecasts from the disaggregate components. Additionally, including information from the disaggregates in the aggregate model rather than aggregating forecasts from the disaggregates performs best in all forecast horizons when appropriate disaggregates are used. The implication of these results is that better inflation forecasts for Ghana are produce by using information from relevant disaggregates in the aggregate model rather than direct forecasts of the aggregate or aggregating forecasts from the disaggregates. In the second essay, I use a structural vector autoregression (SVAR) to model inflation so as to identify the relative importance of shocks to real output growth, monetary growth and exchange rate depreciation in inflation dynamics in Ghana. The results show that neither monetary growth alone nor structural factors alone explain the inflation experience in Ghana and that the structural factors dominate monetary growth in the inflation dynamics. There is a fairly strong feedback between inflation and exchange rate depreciation both of which have weak relationship with monetary growth. These suggest that policies that boost domestic supply and therefore reduce import demand will be more potent than direct monetary management to curb inflation in Ghana. Finally, in the third essay, I the test whether the West African Monetary Zone (WAMZ) is a common currency area by using a vector autoregressive model to study the variance decomposition, impulse responses of key economic variables and linear dependence of the underlying structural shocks of the countries in the zone. The variance decomposition shows that the zone a whole does not have common sources of shock, which is expected because of the diverse economic structures of these countries. The correlation of the structural shocks also shows that these countries respond asymmetrically to common supply, demand and monetary shocks and will therefore respond differently to a common monetary policy. It is therefore not in the interest of the individual countries to go into a monetary union now or in the near future unless the economies of these countries converge further.",2012-08,2023-02-13 13:36:53,2023-02-13 13:36:53,,,,,,,,,,,,,University of Nebraska,,,,,eoh,,EBSCOhost,,,,,,"Inflation; Deflation E31; Price Level; International Monetary Arrangements and Institutions F33; Macroeconomic Analyses of Economic Development O11; Prices, Business Fluctuations, and Cycles: Forecasting and Simulation: Models and Applications E37; Forecasting Models; Simulation Methods C53; Development Planning and Policy: Trade Policy; Factor Movement; Foreign Exchange Policy O24",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,3780,1,222,1193

As in Bernanke and Boivin, 2001, the model aims at capturing the following facts: monetary authorities use information from a large number of data series to extract a signal on current economic activity, which is typically measured with error. Due to strong collinearity between macroeconomic time series, relevant information is obtained by regressing the observables on few aggregates. Collinearity implies that a large panel of time series, which constitutes the information available to policy makers, can be represented as a dynamic factor model a la Forni and Reichlin, 1998, Stock and Watson, 1999 and Forni et al., 2000. Here we show how, in this framework, shocks can be identified structurally and the parameters of monetary policy rules, conditional on these shocks, can be estimated. Our results for the US economy between 1982 and 2001 show that: (i) Two shocks capture 80% of the variance of key variables such as output and inflation at all horizons; (ii) The monetary shock mainly affects the term structure of interest rates, but has virtually no effect on output and inflation so that monetary policy affects the economy through its systematic behavior rather than by surprising agents; (iii) Since demand and technology have been the main forces for the dynamics of cyclical output and inflation during the Greenspan era, while supply shocks have been negligible, monetary authorities did not face any tradeoff between inflation and output. By stabilizing inflation conditionally on demand shocks, they also achieved output stabilization; (iv) Conditionally on demand, Greenspan followed the Taylor principle while, conditionally on technology, monetary policy did not respond; (v) Systematic monetary policy had a substantial role in output and inflation stabilization.",2002,2023-02-13 13:37:15,2023-02-13 13:37:15,,,,Query date: 2023-02-09 16:59:31,,,,,,,,,,,,,,eoh,Availability Note: Information provided in collaboration with the RePEc Project: http://repec.org,EBSCOhost,,,,,,Monetary Policy E52; Central Banks and Their Policies E58; Single Equation Models; Single Variables: Panel Data Models; Spatio-temporal Models C23,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,4282,1,221,1198

Specifically, the output responses are estimated to be significant during the 1970s and 1990s but not during the 1980s. Several recent authors have suggested that the effectiveness of monetary policy is impacted by the stability of the economic environment, i.e., that the noise associated with estimating the true output level makes it difficult for the monetary authority to ""hit its target"" or even to estimate the correct target. In this case, supposed optimal policy may produce any number of possible output responses and none of these consistently. The present results provide additional evidence, as the magnitude of output response appears to be negatively related with the degree of output variability.",2005-04,2023-02-13 13:37:07,2023-02-13 13:37:07,,53-66,,1,4,,International Journal of Business and Economics,,,,,,,,,,,eoh,,EBSCOhost,,,,,,Macroeconomics: Production E23; Monetary Policy E52; Financial Markets and the Macroeconomy E44; Credit; Money Multipliers E51; Money Supply,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,4083,1,221,1202

Heterogeneity in price rigidity further is key in determining which sectors are the most important contributors to the transmission of monetary shocks, and is necessary but not sufficient to generate realistic output correlations. In the model and data, reducing the number of sectors decreases monetary non-neutrality with a similar impact response of inflation.

Such a model is useful for policymakers to assess the impact of policy changes on real economic stability. To answer this question both a traditional structural vector autoregressive, SVAR, and the more recent local projection, LP, estimation technique is used.

The applications are on finance and macroeconomics. Each chapter utilizes time series techniques to analyze dynamic characteristics of data. The first chapter is on composite likelihood (CL) estimation, which has gained a lot of attention in the statistics field but is a relatively new technique to the economics literature. I study its asymptotic properties in a complex dynamic nonlinear model and use it to analyze corporate bond ratings. The second chapter explores the importance of global food price fluctuations. In particular, I measure the effects of global food shocks on domestic macroeconomic variables for a large number of countries. The third chapter proposes a method to interpret latent factors in a data-rich environment. In the application, I find five meaningful factor driving the US economy. Chapter 1, persistent discrete data are modeled by Autoregressive Probit model and estimated by CL estimation. Autocorrelation in the latent variable results in an intractable likelihood function containing high dimensional integrals. CL approach offers a fast and reliable estimation compared to computationally demanding simulation methods. I provide consistency and asymptotic normality results of the CL estimator and use it to study the credit ratings. The ratings are modeled as imperfect measures of the latent and autocorrelated creditworthiness of firms explained by the balance sheet ratios and business cycle variables. The empirical results show evidence for rating assignment according to Through-the-cycle methodology, that is, the ratings do not respond to the short-term fluctuations in the financial situation of the firms. Moreover, I show that the ratings become more volatile over time, in particular after the crisis, as a reaction to the regulations and critics on credit rating agencies. Chapter 2, which is a joint work with Bilge Erten, explores the sources and effects of global shocks that drive global food prices. We examine this question using a sign-restricted SVAR model and rich data on domestic output and its components for 82 countries from 1980 to 2011. After identifying the relevant demand and supply shocks that explain fluctuations in real food prices, we quantify their dynamic effects on net food-importing and food-exporting economies. We find that global food shocks have contractionary effects on the domestic output of net food importers, and they are transmitted through deteriorating trade balances and declining household consumption. We document expansionary and shorter-lived effects for net food exporters. By contrast, positive global demand shocks that also increase real food prices stimulate the domestic output of both groups of countries. Our results indicate that identifying the source of a shock that affects global food prices is crucial to evaluate its domestic effects. The adverse effects of global food shocks on household consumption are larger for net food importers with relatively high shares of food expenditures in household budgets and those with relatively high food trade deficits as a share of total food trade. Finally, we find that global food and energy shocks jointly explain 8 to 14 percent of the variation in domestic output. Chapter 3, which is a joint work with Sinem Hacioglu, exploits a data rich environment to propose a method to interpret factors which are otherwise difficult to assign economic meaning to by utilizing a threshold factor-augmented vector autoregression (FAVAR) model. We observe the frequency of the factor loadings being induced to zero when they fall below the estimated threshold to infer the economic relevance that the factors carry. The results indicate that we can link the factors to particular economic activities, such as real activity, unemployment, without any prior specification on the data set. By exploiting the flexibility of FAVAR models in structural analysis, we examine impulse response functions of the factors and individual variables to a monetary policy shock. The results suggest that the proposed method provides a useful framework for the interpretation of factors and associated shock transmission.",2017-05,2023-02-13 13:36:46,2023-02-13 13:36:46,,,,,,,,,,,,,Columbia University,,,,,eoh,,EBSCOhost,,,,,,Business Fluctuations; Cycles E32; Monetary Policy E52; Dynamic Quantile Regressions; Dynamic Treatment Effect Models; Computational Techniques; Simulation Modeling C63; Consumer Economics: Empirical Analysis D12; Diffusion Processes C22; Single Equation Models; Single Variables: Time-Series Models; Agriculture: Aggregate Supply and Demand Analysis; Prices Q11,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,3631,1,222,1207

In the post sub-prime crisis period, however, there has been an overwhelming intellectual support for revisiting the issue of whether monetary policy should become more sensitive to asset price trends and respond proactively to prevent any build up of bubbles. In the Indian context, this paper provides empirical evidence to explain the relevance of a policy of no direct use of the interest rate instrument for stabilising asset price cycles. While the asset price channel of monetary policy is clearly visible in empirical estimates, there is no evidence of monetary policy responding to asset price developments directly. Asset price changes also do not seem to influence the inflation path, as per the impulse response analysis in a structural VAR model. This suggests why monetary policy may continue to refrain from responding directly to asset price cycles. Credit market shocks, however, explain a significant proportion of asset price variations over medium to long run, which though could be part of a broader comovement of variables over the business cycle, as visible in terms of simultaneous movement in real activity, credit flows and asset prices. Higher interest rates seem to lead to contraction in output, credit demand as well as asset prices; hence, only the impact on asset prices should not be viewed as a good enough reason to use monetary policy for stabilising asset price cycles. The financial stability concerns from asset price bubbles could be better addressed through micro and macro-prudential measures, and the effectiveness of such measures could be enhanced when implemented in a sound macroeconomic policy environment.",2012-03,2023-02-13 13:36:00,2023-02-13 13:36:00,,167-194,,Query date: 2023-02-09 16:27:49,27,,Journal of Economic Integration,,,,,,,,,,,eoh,,EBSCOhost,,,,,,Monetary Policy E52; Financial Markets and the Macroeconomy E44; Fiscal and Monetary Policy in Development O23; Corporate Finance and Governance O16; Economic Development: Financial Markets; Saving and Capital Investment; Asset Pricing; Bond Interest Rates G12; Trading Volume; Event Studies; Information and Market Efficiency; Insider Trading G14,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2579,1,111,1208

Indeed, three main hypothesis on this issue have been put forward: (i) regions with high share of manufacturing, (ii) regions that include higher proportion of small-scale firms and banks, (iii) regions which are more open to trade are likely to respond more strongly to changes in monetary policy. Although these hypotheses have been thoroughly and heatedly discussed by a strand of scholars, far little attention has been paid to the role of geographical factors and spatial spillovers.

The first chapter examines the relative information content of Divisia measures of money and interest rates in explaining key macroeconomic variations and provides a comparison between narrow and broad Divisia measures of money. Using three classes of empirical models, and monthly data from 1967 to 2018, the chapter shows that broad Divisia money measures are weakly procyclical and relatively more informative for predicting economic activities than the acyclical narrow money measures. Together with a SVAR-GARCH (1,1) analysis, the chapter concludes that broad Divisia monetary aggregates are superior to their narrow counterparts in terms of their ability to predict real economic activities and to transmit shocks within the US economy. The second chapter provides a comparative analysis of the relative importance of uncertainty, monetary policy, and leverage shocks in affecting business cycle fluctuations. According to the information-based monetary misperceptions model, monetary shocks are a principal source of business cycles. Recently, some researchers have alluded to uncertainty shocks as alternative drivers of business cycle fluctuations. This chapter assesses the predictive ability of various risk/uncertainty measures in predicting real economic activities and finds that the macroeconomic uncertainty index and the Chicago Fed national financial conditions risk index have the strongest predictive relationship with the economy. Using a penalty function approach to identify three shocks, the chapter concludes that uncertainty shocks are a relatively more important source of variations in the economy than traditional monetary policy shocks. However, monetary policy shocks still outperform uncertainty shocks in explaining inflation dynamics. The final chapter focuses on the role of money supply and leverage in monetary policy and business cycle analysis. Both leverage and the money supply affect the level of economic activity and the business cycle. Yet these variables are mostly not directly considered as key variables in recent monetary and business cycle analyses. Augmenting the standard Taylor-type reaction function of the central bank with measures of money and leverage, this chapter provides a comprehensive comparison of the effects of monetary policy shocks in an economy where the reaction function follows the standard Taylor rule and one that augments it with money and leverage. The identification is based on sign restrictions and other useful prior information of the researcher. This chapter finds that contractionary monetary policy is 2 to 3 times more effective in the augmented model.",2022-04,2023-02-13 13:34:32,2023-02-13 13:34:32,,,,,,,,,,,,,University of Calgary,,,,,eoh,,EBSCOhost,,,,,,Inflation; Business Fluctuations; Cycles E32; Deflation E31; Macroeconomics: Production E23; Monetary Policy E52; Price Level; Government and the Monetary System; Monetary Systems; Payment Systems E42; Regimes; Standards; Credit; Money Multipliers E51; Money Supply,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,480,1,221,1229

However, it is hard to measure such effects owing to the difficulty in isolating credit supply shocks. This paper employs survey data to identify the impact of credit supply shocks in Australia over the past three decades, using a structural vector autoregression approach. We estimate that a one standard deviation shock to the balance of firms reporting difficulty obtaining finance (a 'credit supply shock') reduces Australian GDP by almost 1/3 per cent after one year and gross national expenditure by nearly 1/2 per cent. The effect on business credit is larger and more persistent, with credit declining by nearly 1 per cent relative to its baseline after two and a half years. During the global financial crisis, the cumulative impact of credit supply shocks is estimated to have contributed to a reduction in GDP of 1 per cent (in mid 2009). While credit supply shocks had a notable effect on GDP during the global financial crisis, this credit event appears to have been shorter and sharper than that experienced during the period of financial instability in the early 1990s. Consistent with a 'credit channel' of monetary policy transmission, an unexpected tightening of monetary policy results in a significant increase in the balance of firms reporting difficulty obtaining finance. We also find effects consistent with a financial accelerator mechanism, whereby an improvement in balance sheets results in easier credit conditions and higher GDP and business credit. Altogether, these results suggest that credit market developments have been an integral aspect of the business cycle in Australia since financial deregulation in the 1980s.",2012,2023-02-13 13:37:25,2023-02-13 13:37:25,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,eoh,Availability Note: Information provided in collaboration with the RePEc Project: http://repec.org,EBSCOhost,,,,,,Monetary Policy E52; Diffusion Processes; Dynamic Quantile Regressions; Dynamic Treatment Effect Models; Multiple or Simultaneous Equation Models: Time-Series Models; State Space Models C32; Credit; Money Multipliers E51; Money Supply,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,4503,1,221,1230

I study an endowment economy with segmented markets, where, as in the U.S. economy, monetary policy is set in terms of a short-term nominal interest rate, and I show that the real interest rate increases sizeably for up to one year.

The endogenous processes for the money growth rate and the real interest rate are strongly serially correlated and close to their empirical counterparts.

In doing so, I draw on frontier methods in quasi-experimental design paired with rich micro-level datasets that allow me to study the effectiveness of aggregate policy measures. I also complement my empirical tools with theoretical models to pin down transmission mechanisms. The first chapter examines the impact of corporate tax policy in altering the efficacy of monetary policy. In recent decades there has been much focus in the macroeconomics literature on under-standing heterogeneous effects of monetary and fiscal policy. Although numerous empirical studies have explored monetary policy transmission via various financial and non-financial factors, the theoretical frontier has continuously highlighted that separate analysis of monetary and fiscal policy may overlook important policy interactions. In this chapter, I use narratively-identified variation in marginal tax reforms in the US and show that the average impact of monetary policy depends on preceding corporate tax changes. Specifically, I find that monetary policy is more effective on employment, sales and investment for firms facing an increase in the statutory rate relative to those with stable statutory tax rates. Moreover, I document that monetary policy is least effective on firms that received marginal tax cuts. The empirical findings are rationalized using a New Keynesian model featuring capital and corporate taxes. The theoretical model and empirical results demonstrate that tax shifts may significantly amplify or dampen the effectiveness of monetary policy. The second chapter of my dissertation analyzes post-WWII US corporate tax policy changes. This is part of joint work with James Cloyne and Paolo Surico, where we build two new proxies on marginal tax rate and investment tax credits and investigate the causal effects of corporate tax changes on business investment dynamics. We find that both marginal tax rates and investment tax credits are tools genuinely effective across the firm distribution, yet on average marginal tax rate changes are more effective at raising firms' investment rates than investment tax credits. Exploiting micro-level heterogeneity, we also show that small, low-leverage, and high-growth firms are more sensitive to corporate tax policy changes, which suggests that firm characteristics may have a role in propagating the effectiveness of these tax tools. Overall, our findings provide a comparison of the two most common tools used in corporate tax policy and highlight the role of firm characteristics in studying US corporate tax policy. Lastly, Chapter 3 documents the first micro-level evidence on the asymmetric effects of monetary policy in the US. Various studies on monetary transmission literature have documented non-linear effects of monetary policy at the aggregate level. However, there are few studies that use micro-data to explore sign-dependent monetary effectiveness at the disaggregate level. Focusing on firm-level data from 1980q3 to 2016q3, I find that monetary contractions have larger effects on firm-level employment, investment and sales than monetary expansions. These results are consistent with the aggregate findings in the literature and are robust to sample selection, sector-level analysis and alternative monetary policy shocks. Furthermore, I examine the role of financial characteristics in propagating the asymmetric effects of monetary policy. My findings show a larger employment and investment response to a monetary tightening for firms with small size, low leverage, high liquidity or no-dividend paying status. For the employment results, I also find firms with low leverage or high liquidity to respond more to monetary expansions; however, this effect is much weaker as compared to monetary contractions. These results provide evidence that financial characteristics have a role in propagating the asymmetric effects of monetary policy.",2021-06,2023-02-13 13:34:41,2023-02-13 13:34:41,,,,,,,,,,,,,"University of California, Davis",,,,,eoh,,EBSCOhost,,,,,,Monetary Policy E52; General Aggregative Models: Keynes; Keynesian; Modern Monetary Theory E12; Post-Keynesian; Fiscal Policy E62; Capacity G31; Capital Budgeting; Fixed Investment and Inventory Studies; Business Taxes and Subsidies including sales and value-added (VAT) H25; Fiscal Policies and Behavior of Economic Agents: Firm H32,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,708,1,222,1233
10666,ref_11747,HMLZHCWM,journalArticle,,"Moleka, Elvis Musango",Inﬂation Dynamics And Its Eﬀects On Monetary Policy Rules,,,,,,"This thesis examines dynamic relationships between inflation and monetary policy in a sample of African economies using quarterly data over the period 1980:01 to 2012:04. The literature on inflation dynamics and monetary policy focuses on developed economies, with little attention devoted to the African economies, which is potentially explained by the fact that in the past monetary policy played second fiddle because of fiscal policy dominance following episodes of high inflation and stabilisation policies that occurred in the 1980’s. This thesis fills an important gap in assessing African’s monetary policy. The thesis predominantly uses the Vector-Autoregression (VAR) framework to examine the monetary policy frameworks of the African economies. The thesis finds that an interest rate shock on average explain a more significant proportion of the variance in the output gap and inflation than the exchange rate, in terms of analysing the decomposition of shocks to the economy. This shows a shift in the monetary policy focus away from exchange rate management to interest rate targeting as the African economies have become more market oriented. The monetary policy reveal strong asymmetric responses with respect to the macroeconomic variables when inflation exceeds its threshold value. The analysis suggests that monetary policy in the African economies is regime-dependent, propagated through the inflation thresholds, such that the authorities strongly implement policy changes when inflation goes beyond a certain threshold. The thesis reveals that by taking into account the prior belief of the monetary authorities, it helps produce better estimates of the performance of the monetary policy transmission mechanism, as it combines prior information with the sampling information which is contained in the data. The overall novelty of the thesis is that some African economies are adopting inflation targeting policies instead of exchange rate management. It is imperative that the subsequent inflation targeting frameworks will achieve monetary policy objectives for the African economies and the use of interest rate management should be continued.",,2023-03-27 14:47:51,2023-03-27 14:47:51,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,en,,,,,Zotero,,,,,https://purehost.bath.ac.uk/ws/portalfiles/portal/187919327/Moleka_Elvis_Ph.D._Thesis_28_10_2015.pdf,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,11191,1,222,1234

The paper employs OLS methodology with all the BLUE assumption. The results show that considering the magnitude, 1% increase in RGDP (proxy for economic growth) is brought about by 0.86% increase in narrow money supply (M1), 0.63% increase in broad money supply (M2), 258% decrease in inflation rate (INFLARATE), 1276.3% increase in lending rate (LEDRATE), and 143.9% increase in gross fixed capital formation. This implies that an increase in lending rate and other related variables will lead to a significant increase in real GDP, proxy for economic growth in Nigeria. The estimated value of R2 (goodness of fit) of 0.67 or 67% shows that 67% systematic variation in Real GDP is caused by variation in narrow money supply, broad money supply, inflation rate, lending rate, and gross fixed capital formation. This indicates that indeed, monetary policy has an effect on macroeconomic stability in Nigeria. The study seems to suggest that concerted efforts should be made by the government to focus on increment in narrow and broad money supplies which will aid in the financing of the country’s monetary growth, balancing the price increase, stimulating increased spending, and further enhancing the country’s macroeconomic variables.",2016,2023-03-16 15:37:06,2023-03-16 15:37:06,,,,3,3,,,,,,,,,,en,,,,,Zotero,,,,,https://www.paperpublications.org/upload/book/EFFECTIVE%20MONETARY%20POLICY%20AS%20A%20RECIPE-774.pdf,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,7471,1,111,1235

To identify the model, I use a discrete change in the Fed’s communication policy: the introduction of interest-rate forward guidance.

We use a method to compute counterfactual impulse responses for net capital outflows under the assumption that the domestic policy rate does not respond to foreign monetary tightening.

The results of two identification strategies are compared. One is based on traditional zero restrictions and, as an alternative, an identification scheme based on more recent sign restrictions is proposed. The main conclusion is that the recent slowdown is caused by a combination of several shocks: negative aggregate supply and aggregate spending shocks, the increase of oil prices in 1999, and restrictive monetary policy in 2000. These shocks are more pronounced in the USA than the Euro area. The results are somewhat different depending on the identification strategy.

Findings The findings revealed that while the effect of monetary policy channels on the agricultural sector value added is largely heterogenous and significantly in-elastic, the one on the industrial and services sectors are overwhelmingly homogeneous and negative, but insignificant for the services sector. Moreover, the effect of monetary policy channels on sustainable economic growth is also homogeneously asymmetric, with imminent stagflation, while the interactive effects of monetary policy channels are heterogeneous on sustainable economic growth and economic sectors.

We propose a new focus: directly incorporating the underlying shocks that cause exchange rate fluctuations when evaluating how these fluctuations ""pass through"" to import and consumer prices. A standard open-economy model shows that the relationship between exchange rates and prices depends on the shocks which cause the exchange rate to move. We build on this to develop a structural Vector Autoregression (SVAR) framework for a small open economy and apply it to the UK. We show that prices respond differently to exchange rate movements based on what caused the movements. For example, exchange rate pass-through is low in response to domestic demand shocks and relatively high in response to domestic monetary policy shocks. This framework can improve our ability to estimate how pass-through can change over short periods of time. For example, it can explain why sterling's post-crisis depreciation caused a sharper increase in prices than expected, while the effect of sterling's 2013-15 appreciation was more muted. We also apply this framework to forecast the extent of pass-through from sterling's sharp depreciation corresponding to the UK's vote to leave the European Union.",2018,2023-02-13 13:34:47,2023-02-13 13:34:47,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,eoh,Availability Note: Information provided in collaboration with the RePEc Project: http://repec.org,EBSCOhost,,,,,,Inflation; Deflation E31; Foreign Exchange F31; Monetary Policy E52; Price Level; Open Economy Macroeconomics F41; International Finance: General F30; Demand for Money E41; Economic Integration F15,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,836,1,222,1268

First, it shows that exchange rate movements caused by monetary policy shocks consistently correspond to significantly higher pass-through than those caused by demand shocks in a cross-section of countries, confirming earlier results for the UK. Second, it shows that the underlying shocks (especially monetary policy shocks) are particularly important for understanding the time-series dimension of pass-through, while the standard structural variables highlighted in previous literature are most important for the cross-section dimension.

The study found dissimilar long-run effects of tightening and easing the MPR on unemployment. While tightening the MPR had positive, elastic and statistically significant effect on unemployment, implying complete pass-through, easing the MPR had negative, inelastic and statistically insignificant effect on unemployment, suggesting incomplete pass-through. Similarly, the short-run effects of tightening or easing the MPR were dissimilar. Furthermore, the result of the cumulative multiplier indicated that the cumulative effects of tightening the MPR on unemployment dominated the cumulative effects of easing the MPR on unemployment in Nigeria.

In light of this work, the Federal Reserve's recent policy of “quantitative easing,” with its goal of affecting the supply of liquid assets, appears to be a radical break from standard practice. Alternatively, one could posit that the monetary aggregates, when measured properly, never lost their ability to explain aggregate fluctuations and, for this reason, represent an important omission from standard models and policy discussions. In this context, the new policy initiatives can be characterized simply as conventional attempts to increase money growth. This view is supported by evidence that superlative (Divisia) measures of money often help in forecasting movements in key macroeconomic variables. Moreover, the statistical fit of a structural vector autoregression deteriorates significantly if such measures of money are excluded when identifying monetary policy shocks. These results cast doubt on the adequacy of conventional models that focus on interest rates alone.

The results reveal that GDP growth is more responsive to interest rate shocks when credit growth is low.

By contrast, nominal interest-rate increases that are perceived to be permanent cause a temporary decline in real rates with inflation adjusting faster than the nominal interest rate to a higher permanent level. Estimated impulse responses show that inflation reaches its long-run level within a year. Importantly, because real rates are low during the transition, the economy does not suffer an output loss.

In the India specific context, this paper provides empirical evidence on the relevance of a policy of no direct use of the interest rate instrument for stabilising asset price cycles. While the asset price channel of monetary policy transmission is clearly visible in empirical estimates, there is no evidence of monetary policy responding to asset price developments directly. Asset price changes also do not seem to influence the inflation path, suggesting why monetary policy may continue to refrain from responding directly to asset price cycles. Credit market shocks, however, explain significant part of asset price variations over medium to long-run, which though could be part of a broader comovement of variables over the business cycle, particularly real activity, credit flows and asset prices. Higher interest rates seem to cause contraction in output, credit demand as well as asset prices; hence, only the impact on asset prices should not be viewed as a good enough reason to use monetary policy for stabilising asset price cycles. Financial stability concerns from asset price bubbles could be better addressed through micro and macro-prudential measures, and the effectiveness of such measures could be enhanced when implemented in a sound macroeconomic policy environment.",2010,2023-02-13 13:37:00,2023-02-13 13:37:00,,1-34,,Query date: 2023-02-09 16:27:49,31,,Reserve Bank of India Occasional Papers,,,,,,,,,,,eoh,,EBSCOhost,,,,,,Monetary Policy E52; Financial Markets and the Macroeconomy E44; Fiscal and Monetary Policy in Development O23; Corporate Finance and Governance O16; Economic Development: Financial Markets; Saving and Capital Investment; Asset Pricing; Bond Interest Rates G12; Trading Volume,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,3922,1,111,1288

Analysts typically argue that monetary policy either does not affect the real economy (the classical dichotomy) or only affects the real economy in the short run through aggregate demand (new Keynesian or new classical theories). Real business cycle theorists try to explain the business cycle with supply-side productivity shocks. We provide some preliminary evidence about how monetary policy and its volatility affect the aggregate supply side of the macroeconomy through their effect on total factor productivity and its volatility. Total factor productivity provides an important measure of supply-side performance. The results show that monetary policy and its volatility exert a positive and statistically significant effect on the supply side of the macroeconomy. Moreover, the findings buttress the importance of reducing short-run swings in monetary policy variables as well as support the adoption of an optimal money supply rule. Our results also prove consistent with the effective role of monetary policy during the so-called 'Great Moderation' in US gross domestic product volatility beginning in the early 1980s.",2007,2023-02-13 13:38:09,2023-02-13 13:38:09,,31-pages,,2,10,,International Finance,,,,,,,,,,,eoh,Availability Note: Information provided in collaboration with the RePEc Project: http://repec.org,EBSCOhost,,,,,,Business Fluctuations; Cycles E32; Macroeconomics: Production E23; Monetary Policy E52; Financial Markets and the Macroeconomy E44; Credit; Money Multipliers E51; Money Supply,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,5402,1,222,1289

As a result, price competitive advantage by the rupiah depreciation was lost in the real exchange rate terms. The objective of this paper is to examine the pass-through effects of exchange rate changes on the domestic prices in the East Asian economies using a VAR analysis. Main results are as follows: (1) the degree of exchange rate pass-through to import prices was quite high in the crisis-hit economies; (2) the pass-through to CPI was generally low, with a notable exception of Indonesia: and (3) in Indonesia, both the impulse response of monetary policy variables to exchange rate shocks and that of CPI to monetary policy shocks are positive, large, and statistically significant. Thus, Indonesia's accommodative monetary policy, coupled with the high degree of the CPI responsiveness to exchange rate changes was an important factor in the spiraling effects of domestic price inflation and sharp nominal exchange rate depreciation in the post-crisis period.",2006,2023-02-13 13:34:55,2023-02-13 13:34:55,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,eoh,Availability Note: Information provided in collaboration with the RePEc Project: http://repec.org,EBSCOhost,,,,,,Foreign Exchange F31; Open Economy Macroeconomics F41; Fragmentation F12; Models of Trade with Imperfect Competition and Scale Economies,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1026,1,221,1298

The study found out that monetary policy is significant in curbing inflation threshold in Nigeria, however the effect of monetary policy variables are weak in controlling inflation. This is as a result of the large proportion of informal sector which culminates into a high currency outside bank economy that is largely not affected by monetary policy tools. Also, non-popularity of monetary policy tools as a result of financial illiteracy accounts for its ineffectiveness. The Monetary Policy Rate (MPR) is not statistically significant which has also affected its transmission mechanism to commercial banks interest rate. This is as a result of commercial banks' excess reserves which downplay the efficacy of the MPR in affecting interest rate and money supply. The study recommends amongst others that; first, the CBN should narrow the asymmetric corridor around the MPR to check commercial banks excess reserves. Required cash ratio and liquidity ratios should be adjusted regularly to curtail banks excess reserves; second, the CBN should embark on enlightenment campaigns in financial literacy to buttress popularity of monetary policy tools.

A possible reason is that agents may believe that monetary shocks contain information regarding the central bank’s assessment of the economic environment (Nakamura and Steinsson, 2018). Under this hypothesis, the estimated response to monetary policy shocks would contain two conflating effects: the actual effect of monetary policy and the reaction of private agents to the newly acquired information. This paper overcomes this problem by extracting a novel series of monetary shocks using text analysis methods on central bank documents. The resulting text-based variables contain the informational content from changes in the policy rate. Thus, they can be used to extract exogenous changes in monetary policy that are orthogonal to any central bank information. Using this information-free measure of monetary policy shocks reveals that a monetary tightening is not expansionary, even when estimated on more recent periods.",2021-06-09,2023-03-16 15:38:10,2023-03-16 15:38:10,1678205071.0,,,,,,,,,,,,"Faculty of Economics, University of Cambridge",,en,,Working Paper,,,www.repository.cam.ac.uk,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,7679,1,221,1319

The impulse response function of the VAR model provides some interesting perspectives. First, financial stability, growth and inflation could share a medium-longer-term relationship. Second, enhanced financial stability could be associated with higher growth accompanied by softer interest rates without much threat to price stability in the medium to long term. Third, greater economic stability or higher output growth can enhance financial stability. Fourth, higher inflation or price instability could adversely affect financial stability.

The analysis confirms the presence of a convex relationship between inflation and the output gap, meaning that the coefficient in the Phillips curve on the output gap recurringly increases during times of expansion and abates during recessions. Sign-restricted monetary policy shocks based on a regime-switching monetary SVAR reveal that expansionary monetary policy induces less pressure on inflation at times of weak as opposed to strong growth; thereby rationalizing relatively stronger expansionary policy, including unconventional volume-based policy, during times of deep recession.

Examination of relationships between monetary policy and economic activity at a detailed, disaggregated level indicates several changes within the past quarter century that are broadly consistent with these changes in the underlying economic environment: First, the elimination of major episodes of credit rationing in the mortgage market has clearly rendered housing less sensitive to restrictive monetary policy; moreover, there is no solid evidence of change in the sensitivity of homebuilding to mortgage interest rates. Second, business fixed investment has become more sensitive to financial market conditions, at least in the short run. Third, consumer spending has become less sensitive to interest rate increases and stock price declines, at least in situations that persist for lengthy periods of time.

The virus outbreak has had a serious impact on global health and has caused an economic downturn that is heavily driven by the restrictions implemented to attenuate the health-crisis. Apart from affecting the mobility of individuals, these restrictions impose additional constraints that policy makers need to adhere to when conducting macroeconomic policy as means of mitigating the negative economic effects of the crisis. This thesis investigates what role the level of restrictions play in the extent to which fiscal and monetary policy announcements are able to stimulate economic activity. This is done by estimating several random effects models using a daily panel dataset consisting of 18 euro area countries from 2020-02-15 to 2021-02-25. Interestingly, the results indicate a positive response in economic activity from fiscal policy announcements in the countries subject to the most stringent restrictions, and a negative response in the remaining countries. This suggests a reverse restriction-uncertainty relationship where uncertainty could be the driving force, which increases in surrounding countries as a response to more stringent restrictions in another. This could fuel a “wait and see”-behaviour which has a negative impact on economic activity. The effect of monetary policy is seen to differ across time, rather than across national levels of restrictions. This is suggested to occur due to the (brief) existence of positive animal spirit voiced in an initially positive response from expansionary monetary policy in all countries. This effect is later revised and turns negative, likely due to a Ricardian Equivalence-like response to the unconventional monetary policy interventions.",,2023-03-16 15:33:20,2023-03-16 15:33:20,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,en,,,,,Zotero,,,,,https://lup.lub.lu.se/luur/download?func=downloadFile&recordOId=9059770&fileOId=9059778,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,6499,1,221,1339

First I study the extent to which inflation and output growth differentials are explained by the propagation of common monetary policy interventions. Next, I evaluate the performance of the monetary authority in fulfilling the stabilization needs of the member countries when it aims to stabilize the aggregate economy. Lastly, I empirically evaluate a policy interest rule to determine the implicit weight the policymaker puts on the country-specific inflation and output growth differentials in addition to the aggregate. The results show that monetary policy interventions do not generate significant differences in the inflation behavior across the countries, while they create significant differences in the output dynamics. Moreover, monetary policy innovations do account for a large portion of country-specific output fluctuations. This is in contrast to the business cycle literature where only a small fraction of output variance is attributed to the monetary policy shocks. In addition, it appears that while targeting the aggregate inflation and output dynamics, monetary authority stabilizes cross-country inflation in the face of idiosyncratic shocks fairly well, though there are considerable differences in the welfare losses associated with the cross-country output variability. Furthermore, country-specific inflation deviations are statistically significant in a Taylor type policy feedback rule, while the aggregate output gap and country-specific output gap differentials appear to be statistically insignificant.",2010-12,2023-02-13 13:34:50,2023-02-13 13:34:50,,,,,,,,,,,,,University of North Carolina,,,,,eoh,,EBSCOhost,,,,,,Inflation; Deflation E31; Macroeconomics: Production E23; Monetary Policy E52; Price Level,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,914,1,221,1340

However, exchange rate shocks influence the path of relative output while a deterioration of the current account balance in response to a monetary contraction is observed, suggesting the existence of the expenditure-switching effect. The worsening of the current account in response to a fiscal expansion validates the twin-deficit hypothesis in Nigeria.

Investing in human capital, among other factors can include empowering the active unemployed population with relevant skills that meet labor markets for easy employment. In that case, the tax revenues would increase which could play an important role in reducing government budget deficits. Furthermore, SACU member economies’ central banks can make monetary policy more effective by using monetary accommodation. Hence, when the governments apply expansionary fiscal policy, the central banks can increase money supply to avoid interest rates from increasing (monetizing budget deficit).",2019,2023-03-16 15:36:34,2023-03-16 15:36:34,1677607481.0,,,,,,,The impact of fiscal and monetary policy on economic growth in the SACU member economies between 1980 and 2017,,,,,North-West University (South Africa),,en,,Thesis,,,repository.nwu.ac.za,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,7293,1,221,1344

Second, a positive government spending shock leads to a consumption rise in the model that predicts a consumption fall based on conventional theory.

We also find larger and more persistent effects of monetary and tax policy shocks for states where the ratio between minimum and median wage is higher and for states that do not have right-to-work legislation.",2017,2023-02-13 13:34:49,2023-02-13 13:34:49,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,eoh,Availability Note: Information provided in collaboration with the RePEc Project: http://repec.org,EBSCOhost,,,,,,"Monetary Policy E52; Fiscal Policy E62; Wages, Compensation, and Labor Costs: General J30",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,881,1,222,1359

The study further examines the extent to which changes in monetary policy affect industrial output in expansions relative to contractions. Employing the Peersman and Smets (2001) Markov-Switching Model (MSM) and monthly data from 1994.01–2013.12, the study reveals that the five BRICS countries have similar business cycles. The results further demonstrate that the BRICS countries’ business cycles are characterized by two distinct growth rate phases: a contractionary regime and an expansionary regime. It can also be observed that the area-wide monetary policy has significantly large effects on industrial output in recessions as well as in booms. It has also been established that there is a high probability of moving from state one (recession) to state two (expansion) and that on average, the probabilities of staying in state 2 (expansion) are high for each of the five countries.

First, the banking sector and, in particular, sticky rates attenuate the effects of monetary policy shocks, while financial intermediation increases the propagation of supply shocks. Second, shocks originating in the banking sector explain the largest share of the contraction of economic activity in 2008, while macroeconomic shocks played a limited role.

In the first chapter, I introduce subjective and model-free measures of macroeconomic uncertainty, which are based on belief distributions for future inflation and output growth from the Survey of Professional Forecasters. I find that quantitatively important uncertainty episodes are rare, but persistent. My estimates of macroeconomic uncertainty exhibit strikingly different dynamics compared to existing uncertainty measures, suggesting that much of the variation in these measures is not driven by macroeconomic uncertainty. By re-examining recent empirical work on the relationship between macroeconomic uncertainty and real economic activity, I find that macroeconomic uncertainty shocks have a large and persistent effect on real activity, without an evidence of subsequent overshooting. Due to its model-free and subjective nature, I believe that my measure of uncertainty provides a natural benchmark to distinguish among several competing hypotheses about the association between macroeconomic uncertainty and economic activity. The second chapter investigates the effects of an expansionary monetary policy shock that results in a 1% long-run increase in the price level on output, the bilateral real exchange rate with the United States and the price level in developing economies with inflation targeting. With an empirical panel-VAR model, we show that such a shock leads to a temporary increase in output, a temporary depreciation in the real exchange rate with the United States and a half percent contemporaneous increase in the price level. A multi-sector model with a staggered wage-setting mechanism and asymmetries among sectors with respect to the frequency of price changes is capable of explaining these aggregate dynamics. The third, and the last, chapter uses quotes on options written on crude oil futures to construct nonparametric risk-neutral probability distribution functions (pdfs) for crude oil prices. Based on these pdfs, first, I show that the skewness and the extreme percentiles of these distributions are affected by US. macroeconomic news surprises, but the mean is not. Second, I find that these pdfs perform significantly better than density forecasts generated by popular time-series models at 1 to 3 months horizons. Finally, I show that options-implied volatility and skewness help with point prediction of future oil prices.",2015-06,2023-02-13 13:35:59,2023-02-13 13:35:59,,,,,,,,,,,,,Johns Hopkins University,,,,,eoh,,EBSCOhost,,,,,,Inflation; Deflation E31; Foreign Exchange F31; Macroeconomics: Production E23; Monetary Policy E52; Price Level; Macroeconomic Analyses of Economic Development O11,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2544,1,221,1378

The empirical evidence suggests that a U.S. monetary contraction leads to an immediate rise in the broad commodity price index, which possibly reflects an aggregation bias, greater expected inflation and speculation, high production costs or some overshooting due to overreactions. Then, the response erodes after six quarters as the positive interest rate shock vanishes and higher interest rates and liquidity drainage take traction. Despite this, the aggregate price response masks the existence of significant heterogeneity in the price responses of the different types of commodity sectors. More specifically, a positive interest rate shock leads to: (i) an initial pop in the price returns of the non-fuel commodities, which later reverses path and becomes negative (as in the case of the prices of agricultural raw materials); (ii) a positive and persistent rise in the volatile food prices; (iii) a fall in the beverage prices; and (iv) a persistent reduction in the prices of metals and the prices of energy prices.

The rest was denominated in foreign currencies, predominantly in U.S. dollars. Recent data, however, shows that about a quarter of the total external debt of emerging markets is denominated in their own local currencies (see Arslanalp and Tsuda, 2014). Does this change in the currency of denomination of external debt alter the default incentives of emerging markets? The first two chapters of this dissertation provide an answer to this question. The third chapter of this dissertation examines another question that has gained considerable attention in the past decade--has monetary policy been one of the causes of rising inequality in the United States? A few decades ago, virtually all of the external debt of emerging markets was denominated in foreign currencies. Located at the heart of many emerging-market crises in the 1990s, this skewness in the currency of denomination has been termed 'the original sin', Eichengreen et al. (1999). Nowadays, many emerging markets are able to issue external debt in their own currency. How does this change in the currency of denomination alter default incentives? I show, empirically and theoretically, that an increase in local currency debt decreases the likelihood of default. The first chapter begins by showing that there is a statistically significant positive correlation between higher local currency external debt and better credit ratings, a proxy for the probability of default, and hence lower likelihood of default. This relationship between local currency debt and credit ratings could, however, suffer from endogeneity issues. One potential source of endogeneity is reverse causation--do countries issue more local currency debt because they have a lower likelihood of default or do they have a lower likelihood of default because they issue more debt in the local currency? Hence, estimating the causal effect of local currency debt on default probabilities requires a more solid identification strategy. To study the causal effect of local currency debt on the likelihood of default, I estimate a trivariate Structural Vector Autoregression (SVAR) model. Two rather mild assumptions are needed to identify the structural shocks: that the U.S. interest rate does not respond to the interest rate as well as the local currency external debt of emerging markets, and that the local currency external debt of emerging markets does not contemporaneously respond to the U.S. interest rate. Having imposed these identifying assumptions, I find that sovereign spreads shrink by about 40 to 60 basis points in response to a positive, one standard deviation shock to the local currency share of external debt indicating that the likelihood of default falls. The second chapter studies the relationship between local currency external debt and default likelihoods theoretically. I build a model of sovereign default where there are two currencies of denomination--the home currency and the foreign currency. A bond denominated in the foreign currency is an I.O.U to repay one unit of the foreign currency the next period whereas a bond denominated in local currency pays one unit of the home currency the next period. A benevolent government issues these bonds in the international capital market to smooth the consumption of a representative household that faces shocks to the endowment of traded goods. Moreover, the government prints money which it can use to repay local currency denominated external debt. Default occurs in response to a sufficiently large negative endowment shock, and when it does, the government defaults on all of its debt (i.e., both denominations). There are two costs of default--exclusion from international markets and output costs. Exclusion from international markets lasts for a random number of periods, and upon re-entry, the sovereign's entire stock of debt is erased off the books. I then solve the model and simulate two model economies that are otherwise identical except for the difference in the size of their local currency external debt. One economy has 90% of its external debt in the local currency while the other economy has only 10% of its external debt in the local currency. The default rates, as well as other business cycle statistics of the simulated models, are then compared. The results point to one major conclusion--an economy's stock local currency external debt is an important determinant of whether it will experience a debt crisis. In the model, an increase in the share of local currency debt from 10% to 90% leads to a decrease in the default rate from 4.6% to 0.3%. An important mechanism is behind this result. When there is sizable local currency debt, the government resorts to costly deficit monetization in response to negative output shocks before it exercises the option to default. However, given that inflation engenders welfare cost, outright default will still occur even when most of the external debt is denominated in the local currency. Thus, while the presence of local currency leads to lower default probabilities, it does not imply that outright default completely disappears. In addition to its prediction about default probabilities, the quantitative model is able to replicate some stylized facts about emerging market business cycles. In particular, interest rates and net exports are counter-cyclical, interest rates and net exports are positively correlated, and the standard deviation of consumption is higher than the standard deviation of income, which are all standard business cycle features of emerging markets. The third chapter of this dissertation empirically studies the effect, or the lack thereof, of monetary policy on inequality. The increase in inequality in the United States, while it is part of a trend that began decades ago, has attracted a renewed interest recently. With this attention has come the assertion that monetary policy has been one of the prime drivers of inequality in income and wealth. There are various channels through which monetary policy potentially affects inequality in income and consumption, and some of these channels conceivably work in opposite directions making a comprehensive empirical study on the topic even more important. This chapter provides one such study. The data come from Consumer Expenditure Survey (CEX) and other secondary data sources and run from the first quarter of 1984 to the last quarter of 2014. I construct three measures of income and consumption inequality--Gini coefficient, cross-sectional standard deviation, and percentile ratios--and use them in Vector Autoregression (VAR), Jorda's local projections, and proxy VAR models. Monetary policy in this study covers both conventional and unconventional types. To study the effects of these two policies, I use fed funds rate and rates on two-year treasury notes, respectively. In the local projections and proxy VAR exercises, I also use exogenous monetary policy shocks, proposed by Romer and Romer (2004) and Gertler and Karadi (2015). Estimation of the three models results in qualitatively similar results. First, The impulse responses and the associated confidence bands from the three analyses indicate that while there are some borderline significant effects on income and earnings, the effect of monetary policy, both conventional and unconventional, on income and consumption inequality is generally very weak, if there is any. Second, the results from local projections estimation indicate that monetary policy tends to increase income inequality in the upper half of the distribution and not in the bottom half of the distribution. However, neither in the top nor in the bottom of the consumption distribution does monetary policy have any significant effect. While I believe that this study will contribute to the growing literature on monetary policy and inequality by empirically documenting the relationship between monetary policy and inequality, at least one caveat is in order. Recent studies have shown that data from the CEX suffer from measurement errors. Thus, the inequality measures based on the CEX data are to be taken with caution. Moreover, earlier theoretical work on the topic focused on one particular link between monetary policy and inequality. A more general theoretical framework would be a valuable addition to the literature.",2020-05,2023-02-13 13:34:43,2023-02-13 13:34:43,,,,,,,,,,,,,Cornell University,,,,,eoh,,EBSCOhost,,,,,,"Business Fluctuations; Cycles E32; Interest Rates: Determination, Term Structure, and Effects E43; Monetary Policy E52; Personal Income, Wealth, and Their Distributions D31; International Lending and Debt Problems F34",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,753,1,112,1387

Our Monte Carlo analysis sheds light on the performance of proxy SVARs under realistic scenarios of low relative signal strength attached to MP shocks and alternative assumptions on instrument accuracy. In an empirical application with US data we argue in favor of the specific informational content of instruments based on the dynamic stochastic general equilibrium model of Smets and Wouters (2007). A joint assessment of the benchmark proxy SVAR and the outcomes of a structural covariance change model implies that from 1973 until 1979 monetary policy contributed on average between 2.2 and 2.4 percent of annual inflation.

First, in accordance with Bernanke's proposal (2007), I theoretically explain the effect of restrictive monetary policy on the behavior of both banks and nonbank financial intermediaries through their balance sheet conditions, which is a medium for the two kinds of lenders to shrink their loan supply. Second, if this theoretical explanation is correct, empirically we should expect the net worth and the intermediated loans of both kinds of lending institutions to fall in response to a tight monetary shock. Employing the traditional OLS and the VAR methodology, I find that nonbank financial institutions respond by shrinking their net worth, and they subsequently reduce their loans in the same ways banks do. This evidence suggests that nonbank financial institutions may play an important role in amplifying the effect of monetary policy on output, providing some explanation of the existing puzzles. In my second essay, I provide more evidence on the behavior of small and large firms, employing the Flow of Funds data, the QFR data and other sources. The empirical test to examine behavior of small and large firms is conducted in two ways: (1) by different episodes, tight monetary policy episodes and business cycles episodes and (2) by different time periods, Pre-1990 periods and Post-1990 periods. First, I find that a monetary shock and an NBER recession shock differently affect firms' short-term financing behavior. During recent periods, after a contractionary monetary shock, large firms increase their short-term debt more than small firms, whereas after an NBER recession shock, large firms decrease most balance sheet variables (including short-term debt) more than small firms. These findings suggest that small firms are more credit-constrained after a monetary policy shock, whereas large firms are more credit-constrained after an NBER recession shock. Second, I find that, after a contractionary monetary shock, during earlier periods, large firms decrease their short-term debt less than small firms, whereas during recent periods, large firms increase more than small firms. Although these findings appear to be contradictory, they are consistent in that small firms have continued to be more credit-constrained than large firms after contractionary monetary policy--at the time when demand for loans increases.",2015-08,2023-02-13 13:37:19,2023-02-13 13:37:19,,,,,,,,,,,,,University of Utah,,,,,eoh,,EBSCOhost,,,,,,"Financial Markets and the Macroeconomy E44; Firm Performance: Size, Diversification, and Scope L25; Monetary Policy, Central Banking, and the Supply of Money and Credit: General E50; Financial Institutions and Services: General G20; Corporate Finance and Governance: General G30",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,4364,1,222,1392

For instance, in the late 2000s, the United States experienced a financial crisis that seized domestic and foreign credit markets. The ensuing lack of access to credit brought about a steep decline in output and a sluggish recovery. Accordingly, policymakers commonly take steps to mitigate the effects of adverse credit market conditions and, at times, conduct unconventional monetary policy once traditional policy tools become ineffective. This dissertation is a collection of essays regarding monetary policy, the flow of credit, financial crises, and the macroeconomy. Specifically, I describe monetary policy's impact on the allocation of credit in the U.S. and analyze the role of upstream and downstream credit conditions and financial crises on international trade in a global supply chain. The first chapter assesses the impact of monetary policy shocks on credit reallocation and evaluates the importance of theoretical transmission mechanisms. Compustat data covering 1974 through 2017 is used to compute quarterly measures of credit flows. I find that expansionary monetary policy is associated with positive long-term credit creation and credit reallocation. These impacts are larger for long-term credit and for credit of financially constrained firms and firms that are perceived as risky to the lender. This is predicted by the balance sheet channel of monetary policy and mechanisms that reduce lenders' risk perceptions and increase the tendency to search for yield. Furthermore, I find that, on average, the largest increases in credit creation resulting from monetary expansion are to firms that exhibit relatively low investment efficiency. These estimation results suggest that expansionary monetary policy may have a negative impact on future economic growth. The second chapter evaluates the quantitative effects of unconventional monetary policy in the late 2000s and early 2010s. This was a period when the traditional monetary policy tool (the federal funds rate) was constrained by the zero lower bound. We compute credit flow measures using Compustat data, and we employ a factor augmented vector autoregression to analyze unconventional monetary policy's impact on the allocation of credit during the zero lower bound period. By employing policy counterfactuals, we find that unconventional monetary policy has a positive and simultaneous impact on credit creation and credit destruction and these impacts are larger in long-term credit markets. Applying this technique to analyze the flows of financially constrained and non-financially constrained borrowing firms, we find that unconventional monetary policy operates through the easing of collateral constraints because these effects are larger for small firms or those with high default probabilities. During the zero lower bound period, we also find that unconventional monetary policy brings about increases in credit creation for firms of relatively high investment efficiency. The third chapter pertains to the global trade collapse of the late 2000s. This collapse was due, in part, to strained credit markets and the vulnerability of exporters to adverse credit market conditions. The chapter evaluates the impact of upstream and downstream credit conditions and the differential effects of financial crises on bilateral trade. I find that upstream and downstream sectors' needs for external financing is negatively associated with trade flows when the exporting or importing country's cost of credit is high. However, I find that this effect is dampened for downstream sectors. I also find that downstream sectors' value of collateral is positively associated with trade when the cost of credit is high in the importing country. High downstream trade credit dependence coupled with high costs of credit in the importing country also cause declines in imports. There are amplifying effects of credit costs for sectors that are highly dependent on external financing when the importing or exporting country is in financial crisis. Further, the magnitude is larger when the exporting country is in financial crisis. Finally, I find that these effects on trade flows are large when the exporting country is a developed economy, but they are muted for developing economies.",2018-08,2023-02-13 13:34:46,2023-02-13 13:34:46,,,,,,,,,,,,,University of Kentucky,,,,,eoh,,EBSCOhost,,,,,,Monetary Policy E52; Financial Crises G01; Credit; Money Multipliers E51; Money Supply; Empirical Studies of Trade F14; International Business F23; Multinational Firms; Contracts and Reputation; Networks L14; Transactional Relationships,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,820,1,222,1402

Design/methodology/approach The empirical investigation is implemented for 32 sub-Saharan African countries over the period 2000–2017, with the aid of vector autoregressions and a dynamic panel data model. Findings This study shows that MP has a significant impact on income inequality and the financial system plays an important role by dampening the dis-equalising effects of MP shocks. Both MP and FD directly exert redistributive effects. However, the financial system appears to wield the greatest impact and contribute more to the inequality dynamics. Practical implications The policy-relevant conclusion is that the financial system is crucial for the monetary transmission mechanism and the effects of MP actions. As the economy develops financially, it may require less movement in the policy position to achieve the desired policy outcome. Also, macroeconomic stabilisation policies may not be distributionally neutral and may have a role to play in averting longer-term increases in inequality. Originality/value Contrary to previous studies, this study indicates MP by the structural shocks to purge the MP stance of the issues of endogenous and anticipatory actions. A distinctive finding of this paper is that cross-country differences in monetary regimes and income explain a significant variation in the distributional impacts of monetary policy. Notwithstanding, the evidence shows that the strength of the transmission is more dependent on FD than the nature of the policy regime.",2022-01-01,2023-03-16 15:43:17,2023-03-16 15:43:17,1678309969.0,279-296,,2,39,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Emerald Insight,,,,,,Monetary policy; Income inequality; Financial development; Sub-Saharan Africa,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,8909,1,222,1406

In a second step, monetary policy shocks are further decomposed into traditional interest rate innovations and non-conventional policy actions. Overall, the macroeconomic relevance is considerable. Credit market disturbances account together for more than half of output variation and up to 75 percent of long-run inﬂation variability. The majority of these eﬀects are driven by shocks to the credit multiplier. I further show that the dynamic eﬀects crucially depend on the underlying source of the disturbance. Whereas surges in credit caused by innovations to the credit multiplier have a signiﬁcant positive impact on economic activity and inﬂation, exactly the opposite is the case for exogenous credit demand shocks. Finally, both types of monetary policy instruments can inﬂuence the economy.

We estimate the model for the Euro area by adopting a minimum distance approach. Our findings exhibit that, first, frictions on the loan market influence the propagation of monetary policy shocks as the pass-through of a change in the money market rate to the loan rate is incomplete, and, second, the cost channel is operating, but the effect is weak since inflation is driven by real unit labor costs rather than the loan rate. Our main conclusion is that the strength of the cost channel is mitigated as banks shelter firms from monetary policy shocks by smoothing lending rates.",2006,2023-02-13 13:34:57,2023-02-13 13:34:57,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,eoh,Availability Note: Information provided in collaboration with the RePEc Project: http://repec.org,EBSCOhost,,,,,,Monetary Policy E52; Financial Markets and the Macroeconomy E44; Central Banks and Their Policies E58,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1069,1,222,1411

The first chapter examines how monetary policy shocks in the U.S. affect the flows of workers among three labor market categories--employment, unemployment, and non-participation--and assesses each flow's relative importance to changes in labor market ""stock"" variables like the unemployment rate. I find that job loss accounts for the largest portion of monetary policy's effect on labor markets. I develop a New Keynesian model that incorporates these channels and show how a central bank can achieve welfare gains from targeting job loss, rather than output, in an otherwise standard Taylor rule. The second chapter examines the role of monetary policy in ""job polarization."" I argue that contractionary monetary policy has accelerated the decline of employment in routine occupations, which largely affected workers with a high-school degree but no college. In part by disproportionately affecting industries with high shares of routine occupations, contractionary monetary policy shocks lead to large and persistent shifts away from routine employment. Expansionary shocks, on the other hand, have little effect on these industries. Indeed, monetary policy's effect on overall employment is concentrated in routine jobs. These results highlight monetary policy's role in generating fluctuations not only in the level of employment, but also the composition of employment across occupations and industries. The third chapter introduces new direct measures of uncertainty derived from the Michigan Survey of Consumers. The series underlying these new measures are more strongly correlated with economic activity than many other series that are the basis for uncertainty proxies. The survey also facilitates comparison with response dispersion or disagreement, a commonly used proxy for uncertainty in the literature. Dispersion measures have low or negative correlation with direct measures of uncertainty and often have causal effects of opposite sign, suggesting that they are poor proxies for uncertainty. For the measures based on series most closely correlated with economic activity, positive uncertainty shocks are mildly expansionary. This result is robust across identification and estimation strategies and is consistent with ""growth options"" theories of the effects of uncertainty.",2018-05,2023-02-13 13:34:15,2023-02-13 13:34:15,,,,,,,,,,,,,University of Texas,,,,,eoh,,EBSCOhost,,,,,,Intergenerational Income Distribution; Unemployment; Wages; Employment; Aggregate Human Capital; Aggregate Labor Productivity E24; Business Fluctuations; Cycles E32; Monetary Policy E52; Central Banks and Their Policies E58,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,41,1,222,1413

The strength of these forces varies across households depending on their marginal propensities to consume, their balance sheet composition, the sensitivity of their own earnings to fluctuations in aggregate labor income, and the responsiveness of aggregate earnings, asset prices and inflation to monetary policy shocks. We quantify all these channels in the euro area by combining micro data from the HFCS and the EU-LFS with structural VARs estimated on aggregate time series.

Considering such dimensions provides insights into the effect of monetary policy interventions because the credit components are observed to respond differently. Several possible motivations are behind such a differential response and those relate to either demand and supply factors intrinsic to the transmission mechanism of monetary policy. Our objective is to unveil such a differential response across a couple of relevant dimensions and discuss the possible causes behind what observed. The analysis refers to the US and is based on a vector auto-regression estimated using Bayesian techniques and identified with a combination of sign and zero-restrictions.,2021,2023-03-16 15:35:15,2023-03-16 15:35:15,1677489708.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,en,,,,,Social Science Research Network,,"Place: Rochester, NY",,,,SSRN; Gianluca Cafiso; Giulia Rivolta; Heterogeneous Loans and the Effect of Monetary Interventions,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,6937,1,222,1423

Many papers use futures on the interest rates as monetary policy instruments; however, we do not have these futures in the Russian ﬁnancial market. Therefore, I use diﬀerent currency futures as monetary surprises because these futures are liquid, and they can reveal the market sentiment. I take the dates when the Board of Directors of the Central Bank of Russia made a decision on the key rate and looked at the changes in the currency exchange market in a tiny 30-minute window. Next, I construct a structural vector autoregression model to show the eﬀect of these surprises on macroeconomic variables. In the identiﬁcation process, I use an external instrument approach a-la Gertler and Karadi. Finally, I compare the results with other methods (Cholesky decomposition).

Second, having estimated the model by Bayesian techniques we analyze to which extent labor market shocks, such as disturbances in the vacancy posting process, shocks to the separation rate and variations in bargaining power are important determinants of business cycle fluctuations.

However, slowing the economy to stabilize asset prices would have adverse distributional effects. Impulse-response functions from identified vector autoregression (VAR) indicate that unexpected increases in the federal funds rate increase unemployment among blacks and Hispanics by 50 to 90 percent more than among whites. A narrative approach applied to two disinflationary periods shows that higher interest rates in the 1974 disinflation decimated the housing industry and that two interest-rate-sensitive sectors-construction and durable goods-showed the largest declines in 1980 and 1981 (periods following the 1979 tightening). Utilizing the Romer and Romer examination of the minutes of Federal Open Market Committee meetings to determine dates on which the Fed attempted to create a recession to reduce inflation, antiinflationary policy shocks can be estimated to increase unemployment among nonwhites more than twice as much as they do among whites. A social accounting matrix (SAM) indicates that in the sectors that were hardest hit by recession following the 1974-1975 and 1979-1982 disinflations (construction and durable goods), blue-collar workers were harmed more than other workers in terms of lost income and urban households were hurt much more than rural households.

In the context of a highly accommodative monetary stance over recent years, the analysis focuses on the effects of monetary policy on inequality over the business cycle via its impacts on returns on assets, the cost of debt servicing and asset prices. While monetary policy easing has a priori ambiguous effects on income and net wealth inequality, in practice these effects are estimated to be small. Cross-country differences in the size and distribution of income and net wealth explain contrasting effects. A house price increase generally reduces net wealth inequality, while the opposite is true for increases in equity and bond prices. Higher inequality can reduce the effectiveness of monetary policy stimulus in boosting private consumption, but such effects are estimated to be small. Cross-country differences in the size and composition of household financial assets rather than in their distribution are more relevant for differences in the effectiveness of monetary policy, especially via the wealth channel.",2016-03-03,2023-03-16 15:43:46,2023-03-16 15:43:46,1678312046.0,,,,,,,,,,,,OECD,Paris,en,,,,,OECD iLibrary,,,,,,monetary policy; income inequality; consumption wealth effects; net wealth inequality,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,8135,1,222,1439

While conventional impulse response analysis is restricted to evaluation using the conditional mean function, here, we propose an alternative impulse response analysis that traces the effect of economic shocks on the conditional quantile function. By changing the quantile index over the unit interval, it is possible to measure the effect of shocks on the entire conditional distribution of a variable of interest in our framework. Therefore we can observe the complete distributional consequences of policy interventions, especially at the upper and lower tails of the distribution as well as at the mean. Using the new approach, it becomes possible to evaluate two distinct features (called “distributional effects”): (i) a change in the dispersion of the conditional distribution of interest after a shock, and (ii) a change in the degree of skewness of the conditional distribution caused by a policy intervention. None of these features can be observed in the conventional impulse response analysis exclusively based on the conditional mean function.

To that end, a FAVAR model is used to trace out the eﬀects of an increment of ECB’s intervention rate on industrial production, unemployment and harmonised prices in seven countries of the EA. The results show that the eﬀects of a contractionary monetary shock on the industry are homogenous across the selected countries, falling after the intervention - except for Greece. This is a result of the synchronisation of the industrial business cycle and common funding patterns in the sector. However, the unemployment responses are heterogeneous both in size and sign, suggesting that the lack of a common European regulatory framework for labour has prevented the integration of the labour markets in the EA, and a common framework would improve the synchronisation of the business cycles among the EA countries. Finally, the eﬀects on prices are heterogeneous in size but not in sign, showing a more moderate response than on production terms and even neutral for some countries.",,2023-03-16 15:38:43,2023-03-16 15:38:43,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,en,,,,,Zotero,,,,,https://www.ucm.es/data/cont/media/www/pag-92948/GavilarRubioApr19.pdf,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,7758,1,111,1441

The analyses are performed in four stages. The first of them attempts at systematization of the achievements of existing economic theory with respect to the  nexus between monetary policy and unemployment. The second presents monetary policy and unemployment in a standard DSGE framework. The final two parts approach the problem from an empirical perspective using both the statistical methods and purposefully built and developed econometric models. Finally, some postulates concerning desirable monetary policy are formulated. The analyses provided meaningful results. It was proven that monetary policy is a viable instrument that might be used in order to increase the level of output produced in Polish economy and alleviate the labour market performance when the unemployment rate is relatively high. It was also noticed that the use of expansive monetary policy for the purposes of business cycle support comes at a cost of rising inflation. As a result, expansive monetary policy should never be used in a consecutive manner, but rather as a short-run, transitory source of economic stimulation, so as to fulfil the definition of a temporary shock. The results of performed welfare analysis which proved that unemployment rate augmented Taylor rule outperformed any other combination of variables enabled us to go even a step further and to recommend that if the monetary policy is performed according to the strict guidance given by a corresponding rule and its ultimate aim is the maximisation of social welfare, understood as stabilisation of consumption at its steady state level, then simultaneous inflation and unemployment rates' targeting should comprise the best possible guidance for the purpose of monetary policy execution in an analysed small open economy.",2019,2023-03-16 15:42:23,2023-03-16 15:42:23,1678288876.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,en,,,,,dspace.uni.lodz.pl,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,8703,1,221,1444

To do this, six diﬀerent Structural VAR models are estimated on US quarterly data for the period 1970-2020. The estimations suggest that the own interest rate (Sraﬀa, 1932; Teixeira, 2015) produces more persistent and statistically signiﬁcant eﬀects on autonomous consumption and on output than the real interest rate. The implication of these results is twofold. First, these ﬁndings conﬁrm the hypothesis that monetary policy transmission passes through autonomous consumption, in particular via changes in house prices. Second, the persistence of the eﬀect of autonomous consumption on output reaﬃrms its long run implications that goes beyond the business cycle, in line with the recent literature on autonomous demand-led growth. Furthermore, after the inclusion of rents and the overall price level, a positive monetary policy shock leads to an increase in rents, while housing prices decrease and the overall price level increases, giving a possible explanation of the Gibson’s Paradox. This contradictory movement in rent prices explains part of the price puzzle since shelter has a signiﬁcant impact as one of the main components of the Consumer Price Index (Dias and Duarte, 2019). These latter results open a path for the discussion of the linkages between monetary policy and distribution, since recent expansionary monetary policy did not fail to translate into worsening house aﬀordability leading to a decrease in home-ownership (particularly aﬀecting lower-income households). In this sense, it is evident that autonomous consumption has to move in step rather than detached from income distribution, making the case for income and redistribution policies.",,2023-03-16 15:49:13,2023-03-16 15:49:13,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,en,,,,,Zotero,,,,,https://www.boeckler.de/pdf/v_2021_10_29_goes.pdf,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,10675,1,111,1447

With this structural framework, I recover a novel open-economy estimate of the U.S. natural rate. The paper's main results are: (a) the decline in the U.S. natural rate largely follows the slide of the long-run real interest rate in the forecast data, but is partly cushioned in the short run by the contribution of domestic and to a significant extent also foreign productivity shocks; (b) the fall of U.S. measured labor productivity during this time contributed to a concomitant fall in U.S. output potential; (c) the past decade is also characterized by the compression of markups (negative cost-push shocks) which accounts for much of the cyclical upswing in U.S. output in spite of the fall in its potential; and (d) monetary policy has shown its efficacy boosting U.S. output and sustaining U.S. inflation close to its 2 percent target against the drag on inflation from the negative cost-push shocks during this time.

In particular, it considers the role of interenterprise arrears in the transmission process, as well as the question of whether monetary impulses could affect the sectoral pattern of the industrial recession. It appeal's that the fall in output related to monetary contraction may be significant, given the deficiencies of the credit market, while distortions associated with the policy (which resulted in a lack of liquid assets in the system and was translated into the outburst of quasi-money and extremely high interest rates) may lengthen the recession. Underdevelopment of the financial sector alters the propagation mechanisms of monetary impulses. The lending channel, which is likely to remain the main channel in initial stages of transition, is significantly modified in comparison with the one in developed economies. On the supply side the lack of adequate substitutes for the Central bank of Russia (CBR) loanable funds, reflecting the structural weakness of the banking system, intensifies the decline of credit supply in periods of monetary tightening. On the demand side the lack of substitutes for bank credit deepens enterprise-side reaction, adversely affecting the viability of firms in the long-run. We examine the role of interenterprise arrears using a two-sector (energy vs manufacturing) non-Walrasian general equilibrium model with price regulation and credit rationing. The model explains the transactions’ role of money and reveals that interenterprise arrears may soften or strengthen production-side responses to monetary impulse in the steady state (if compared with the case when no arrears are allowed). The precise results depend on the characteristics of the production function and the transaction cost function, and the level of real money balances. Empirical evidence appears to favor the “cushioning” effect of arrears. The model allows one to highlight the mechanisms through which policy, meant to fight inflation, could cause an increase in inflation together with a decline of both sectors’ output and consumption. Two versions of the model are considered: one with credit rationing of both sectors, and one with asymmetric rationing. The latter appeal's to receive significant empirical support for 1994-96, suggesting that deeper decline in the manufacturing sector may partially, along with other reasons, be explained by its higher exposure to credit-rationing, and therefore, higher losses associated with monetary tightening. A relaxation of the credit rationing constraint to the second sector, and/or a decrease in interest rates, may be growth promoting strategies, implying that there is scope for governmental intervention",,2023-03-16 15:39:18,2023-03-16 15:39:18,1678233600.0,,,,,,,Monetary Policy Transmission in Russia (1992-96),,,,,,,de,,,,,,,,,,https://www.proquest.com/openview/622412611068e6651f7f6c0674db002f/1?pq-origsite=gscholar&cbl=2026366&diss=y,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,7901,1,222,1466

This thesis applies the nonparametric kernel density model to demonstrate the relationship between monetary policy variables and economic growth, and using the Bayesian Metropolis-Hastings models to estimate the monetary effect. Furthermore, this thesis would apply the panel approach (pooled, fixed, and random effect) to improve the monetary policy model. The empirical result could be described as follows; the fixed effect model is the most effective method that could explain the monetary policy effect on economic growth for ASEAN countries. The result also shows that for inflation targeting group, both inflation and interest rate would stimulate economic growth, however, the exchange rate would slow down the economic growth of countries.

Furthermore, for mixed targeting group, the result show that the inflation rate and exchange rate have a negative effect on economic growth while money supply and interest rate would stimulate economic growth.

It is shown that shocks to Germany's macroeconomic fundamentals have a significant impact on Greece's inflation rates, industrial production, and interest rates. Our empirical results indicate that the root cause of the Greek debt crisis emanates from imbalances in its balance of payment, mainly in its current account, losses in competitiveness vis-a-vis Germany, and the lack of nominal adjustment measures through monetary policy due to Greece's membership in the Eurozone. We argue, in the absence of nominal adjustment mechanisms, Greece will probably have to go through prolonged deflationary episodes in order to enhance its competitiveness, produce a positive current account, reduce its budget deficits and public debt, and reverse capital outflows. We also argue, in the absence of an effective monetary policy, countries members in a monetary union running large budget and current account deficits maybe more prone to a Greek debt type crisis.",2018-01,2023-02-13 13:36:10,2023-02-13 13:36:10,,22-33,,,43,,Research in International Business and Finance,,,,,,,,,,,eoh,,EBSCOhost,,,,,,"Financial Crises G01; Macroeconomic Issues of Monetary Unions F45; Current Account Adjustment; Short-term Capital Movements F32; International Lending and Debt Problems F34; National Budget, Deficit, and Debt: General H60",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2821,1,222,1476

What are the effects of monetary policy on income inequality? and why and how does inflation play a role? Income inequality largely increased from the time the Bank of Canada began targeting inflation, through the late 1990s to the early 2000s, and flattened or decreased after the 2008 financial crisis. On the whole, income inequality today is greater than it was when the Bank of Canada became an inflation-targeting central bank. Against this backdrop, our analysis shows that expansionary monetary policy shocks, triggered by a lower than expected bank rate, lead to increasing income inequality, while contractionary monetary policy shocks reduce income inequality. We then show that these effects are asymmetric with expansionary shocks having a greater impact on income inequality than contractionary shocks. Expansionary monetary policy shocks result in a higher share of national income shifting to higher income households, who consume less as a percentage of their income, dampening the increase in aggregate demand, and, therefore, inflation.Our results lead to one particularly important conclusion for monetary policy: namely, that the Bank of Canada needs to account for the impact of income inequality when modeling how inflation will respond to a change in the overnight rate.",2020-01-28,2023-03-16 15:44:37,2023-03-16 15:44:37,1678362780.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,en,,,,,Social Science Research Network,,"Place: Rochester, NY",,,,Monetary Policy; Interest Rates; Inflation and Inflation Control; Cyclical Policies; Policy Guidance,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,9343,1,111,1489

We focus on the earnings heterogeneity and the income composition channel and find that a monetary easing shock involving a decrease short-term nominal interest rate has diverse effects on the different income classes, which seems to have led to a more equal income distribution. As theoretically argued by these monetary policy transmission mechanisms, our results confirm the GDP growth and the decrease in unemployment caused by the monetary policies implemented by the European Central Bank since the onset of the financial crisis have had a positive effect for those households located at the bottom of the income-class structure as well as for the middle class.",,2023-03-16 15:33:58,2023-03-16 15:33:58,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,en,,,,,Zotero,,,,,https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/214838095.pdf,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,6638,1,221,1493

For this purpose, a bayesian VAR is estimated on a panel of six major emerging countries. Monetary and risk shocks are identified by imposing only very mild restrictions. It is found that a positive interest rate shock results in a persistent decline in production and inflation. The net foreign asset position even improves in most of the countries. Thus no large net inflows are observed and there is no sign of a perverse effect on aggregate demand. More interestingly, central banks loosen interest rate policy significantly and persistently in the face of a capital inflow shock, possibly to dampen the immediate disinflationary effect of the appreciation and/or to protect balance sheets from exchange rate volatility. In some specifications this results in overheating (positive industrial production gap and inflation) in the medium-term.

It finds that unanticipated hikes and cuts in the policy rate have a symmetric impact on aggregate demand, but differentially impact the components. While the impacts on investment are negative and symmetric, they are asymmetric on private consumption, with only an unanticipated cut in policy rate having a significant negative impact. Government consumption is unaffected by monetary policy shocks. The impact of unanticipated interest rate changes on inflation is negative and symmetric. Anticipated policy rate changes also have a negative impact on aggregate demand and its components, except for government consumption, but between certain levels, such changes are ineffective, indicating a neutral impact. Anticipated policy rate changes have a negative impact on inflation at all levels.JEL Classification:C32, C51, E31, E52",2017-08-01,2023-03-16 15:43:46,2023-03-16 15:43:46,1678311983.0,290-314,,3,11,,,,,,,,,,en,,,,,SAGE Journals,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,9043,1,111,1511

Determining whether monetary policy affects financial variables domestically—especially compared to the effects of macroprudential policies— and across borders, is crucial in this context. This paper looks into these issues using U.S. exogenous monetary policy shocks and macroprudential policy measures. Estimates indicate that monetary policy shocks have significant and persistent effects on financial conditions and can attenuate long-term financial instability. In contrast, the impact of macroprudential policy measures is generally more immediate but shorter-lasting. Also, while an exogenous increase in U.S. monetary policy rates tends to reduce credit and house prices in other countries—with the effects varying with country-specific characteristics—an increase driven by improved U.S. economic conditions tends to have the opposite effect.

Based on the analyses of impulse response functions, it was found that interest rate policy has a bigger impact on the cyclical component of employment than on total employment. The shrinking effect of employment by a hike in interest rate is estimated to be larger in contrast to the expanding effect of employment as a result of declining interest rate. Interestingly, most of the effect of interest rate on employment is realized through wage workers and manufacturing sector employment rather than non-wage workers or service sector employment. In this regard, in order to expand total employment and keep it at a desire level, to enable inclusive growth, it is essential to reduce the volatility of the policy rate and maintain interest rate at a long-term neutral level for a prolonged period and to reduce exchange rate volatility created by changes in interest rate. In particular, it is necessary to ensure that exchange rate does not appreciate too much, so as to avoid over-shooting of the exchange rate in order to reduce the volatility of manufacturing sector employment when interest rates are on the rise.",,2023-03-16 15:43:48,2023-03-16 15:43:48,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,en,,,,,Zotero,,,,,https://www.bnm.gov.my/documents/20124/811500/Paper_4%20Monetary_Policy_towards_Inclusive_Growth-The%20Case_of_Korea.pdf,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,9077,1,111,1513

Findings – The results show that both Islamic banks' financing and deposit play important roles in the monetary transmission process in the Malaysian economy. In particular, both Islamic deposit and financing are shown to be statistically significant in linking the monetary policy indicator to the real output.

This may not be so if the country with the larger output gap converges to full-employment equilibrium faster than the country with the smaller gap. We argue that common monetary policy can be destabilizing when countries' responses to non-monetary shocks are perfectly symmetric with a correlation of 1 but exhibit differing investment sensitivities to the real interest rate. We use Canada, Mexico, and the United States to test the feasibility of a monetary union by documenting whether: 1) gross investments in Canada and Mexico are equally responsive to the real fund rate, and 2) Canada and Mexico's output growth and inflation respond differently to US monetary policy shocks and oil price shocks. This approach implicitly dictates whether the shocks themselves are symmetric or asymmetric. Using quarterly data and SVAR methodology, we conducted two layers of analysis. We estimated SVARs for the periods 1970-2008, 1970-1990, and 1991-2008 to find that a monetary union is feasible between Canada and the US for the first two sample periods. For Canada and Mexico, we find similar responses of output growth to US monetary policy shocks.

Empirical Evidence from Indonesia and Malaysia,,,,,,"As an interest-free banking system shows tremendous growth in many countries nowadays, the question of how Islamic banks contribute to monetary policy transmission is increasingly important for policymakers. This study aims to investigate and compare the role of Islamic banks in transmitting monetary policy to the real economy in Indonesia and Malaysia, two countries with established dual banking systems and a growing number of Islamic banks. To achieve its objective, the study relied on Impulse Response Functions and Variance Decomposition Analysis, based on Vector Autoregressive (VAR) methodology. The model consisted of four variables (Islamic banks’ deposits, Islamic banks’ financing, overnight interest rates, and economic output), while the monthly data used cover the period between January 2007 and December 2016. The principal conclusion is that deposits and financing of Islamic banks play an important although a modest role in transmitting monetary policy to the economies of Indonesia and Malaysia. A plausible explanation of this result is the relatively low market share of Islamic banks in both countries. Additionally, the lower significance of Islamic financing in Malaysia, compared to Indonesia, is due to Malaysia’s smaller proportion of profit-loss sharing (PLS) financing. As a result, PLS financing has a smaller impact on Malaysian economic growth. The results suggest that to enhance their economic impact, Islamic banks need to increase their PLS-based financing. This study overall findings contribute to policy information about how Islamic banks can contribute to achieving both economic and monetary policy goals in Indonesia and Malaysia.",2020,2023-03-16 15:39:17,2023-03-16 15:39:17,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,en,,,,,Zotero,,,,,http://119.40.116.186/resources/files/Pertanika%20PAPERS/JSSH%20Vol.%2028%20(1)%20Mar.%202020/44%20JSSH(S)-1090-2019.pdf,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,7887,1,112,1535

The Section Two challenges the conventional wisdom that government spending is effective and labor tax cuts are not effective, when interest rate is at lower bound (LB). I use a dynamic stochastic general equilibrium (DSGE) New Keynesian model with labor search and matching frictions to evaluate the effectiveness of fiscal policy. Labor search and matching frictions generate a steep aggregate supply curve, which changes the comparative curvature to the aggregate demand curve at the lower bound. Labor tax cuts are expansionary rather than contractionary, while government spending is not effective. The policy implication is that firms' supply side factors should be considered when conducting fiscal policy. After the Financial Crisis in 2008, the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) of the United States recovered only slowly to its pre-crisis level. There are two notable phenomena after the Great Recession: the fall in the labor force participation rate and the decline of the growth rate of Total Factor Productivity (TFP). In Section Three, I build a Dynamic Stochastic General Equilibrium (DSGE) model that includes endogenous growth and dynamic labor market components (including labor force participation), the first of its kind in the literature. A Bayesian estimation is applied to this model. I find four shocks (a monetary policy shock, a government spending shock, a financial related shock, and a labor productivity shock) can explain most of the variation in GDP that occurred after the financial crisis. Section Four evaluates and backtest commonly used Value-at-Risk(VaR) methods in practice, for three portfolios of assets: equities, bonds and currencies. Specifically, I compute one-day-ahead forecasts for the time period from 2001 to 2018, and compare them to the realized daily profits and losses of these portfolios. Portfolio-based methods like Variance-Covariance produce very conservative estimates in general. The performances of VaR methods are related to the VaR confidence interval, underlying portfolio and the sample periods. The underlying properties of the distribution of a portfolio should be taken into consideration when choosing the VaR method.",2019-08,2023-02-13 13:36:31,2023-02-13 13:36:31,,,,,,,,,,,,,Texas A&M University,,,,,eoh,,EBSCOhost,,,,,,Business Fluctuations; Cycles E32; Macroeconomics: Production E23; General Aggregative Models: Keynes; Keynesian; Modern Monetary Theory E12; Post-Keynesian; Financial Crises G01; Fiscal Policy E62,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,3297,1,221,1536

Specifically, there is evidence of a great moderation in the volatility of the term structure post-1992.

Changes in the transfer of the regulator’s monetary policy via channels of the monetary transmission: the level of prices, interest, rate, bank crediting, and channel of monetary flows were statistically confirmed. It was determined that the specified channels had relative importance in transferring the policy and acted with the relatively different level of efficiency during the pre- and post-crisis period. The growth of efficiency of the channel related to the unforeseen growth of prices level, channel of bank crediting, and channel of monetary flows during the post-crisis period were revealed.

Theoretically, we survey the techniques of monetary control and identify the process whereby these techniques might affect the macroeconomic behavior. Theories of how to conduct the monetary policy view the latter as an economic instrument which uses money supply and interest rates as intermediate objectives to help achieve a healthy business cycle-growth in output, low unemployment and low inflation. Empirically, we identify the techniques of the monetary policy applied in Lebanon during the years 1993-2002 and analyze their impact on the macroeconomic situation. We provide evidence that neither economic growth nor unemployment reduction were considered as ultimate targets for the monetary authority in Lebanon. Since 1993, the Lebanese monetary policy has been targeted at maintaining strength and stability in the exchange rate, controlling the inflation rate, and most importantly, financing the current expenses of the public sector. Moreover, interest rates that are supposed to be consequences of the application of the monetary policy instruments were artificially manipulated by the Lebanese Government to achieve its targets. High interest rates on treasury bills discouraged private investment in the productive sectors of the Lebanese economy. Most foreign and local capital was invested in highyield government bonds rather than in high-value economic growth and employment-promoting activities. This was the major contributor to the decline in lending opportunities to the productive sectors and to the allocation of larger national resources to bondholders-the majority from wealthy and high-income classes. Monetary policy in Lebanon constituted a major obstacle to productive investment and consequently to economic growth and unemployment reduction. This study provides evidence in favor of this argument confirming that the recent economic crisis in Lebanon is the result of the bad application of the monetary policy instruments throughout the 1993-2002 period.",2003,2023-03-16 15:37:04,2023-03-16 15:37:04,1678198932.0,,,,,,,,,,,,Notre Dame University-Louaize,,en,,Thesis,,,ir.ndu.edu.lb:8080,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,7451,1,122,1568

China's impact is significant with the Eurozone displaying the most interdependence and Japan the least.

This document is divided into three main chapters to allow for a separate discussion of each individual category. The first chapter studies the impacts of uncertainty shocks on the US economy in the presence of different specifications of financial constraints. Different specifications of financial constraints include assets-based constraints and earnings-based frictions. Quantitative analysis based on empirical and New Keynesian models suggests that uncertainty shocks have adverse impacts on the US economy. Furthermore, the New Keynesian analysis also suggests that uncertainty shocks might have economic impacts of different nature depending upon the nature of financial frictions considered. Additionally, the chapter suggests that both the collateral constraints and earnings-based constraints might have tightened due to uncertainty shocks during the great recession of 2008/09. The Second Chapter studies the impacts of oil price shocks on US employment growth. Using the GARCH-M-VAR model on monthly data of employment growth and oil price growth from 1974 February to 2018 November, this paper finds that oil price shocks have asymmetric impacts on employment growth in private sector while public sector employment growth show symmetric responses. Furthermore, the paper argues that asymmetric impacts of oil price shocks on aggregate and sectoral job growths might be attributed to oil price uncertainty. The Third Chapter assesses the roles of financial development and financial openness on policy effectiveness in spurring economic growth. This chapter uses the Dynamic Panel GMM model on the data of 107 countries from 1980 to 2018. The empirical model analysis suggests that financial development is negatively associated with monetary policy effectiveness on increasing output growth. Additionally, the paper also finds that the diminishing impacts of financial development on policy effectiveness are more pronounced in countries with a higher level of financial development.

Calls for lower interest rates have become louder as the country's private driven growth has slowed down. However, monetary policy faces the challenges of maintaining external stability and reviving domestic conditions, which could necessitate conflicting interest rate policies. To determine which goals are most suitable for monetary policy, one must understand the effects of monetary policy and its transmission channels to the macro economy. Our empirical results suggest that monetary policy in Turkey has fairly limited power to affect output growth, even in the short-run. We find that external factors--such as shocks to risk aversion and global growth--have a much stronger impact on economic activity in Turkey. These results seem to be in line with the strand of the literature, which highlights the importance of global financial cycles and argues that exchange rate flexibility alone is not enough to guarantee monetary autonomy in a world of large capital flows. Consequently, our empirical findings corroborate the notion that monetary policy should focus on its overriding objective of price stability, given Turkey's greater exposure to supply shocks and pro-cyclicality of international finance.",2019-07,2023-02-13 13:35:41,2023-02-13 13:35:41,,231-249,,Query date: 2023-02-08 13:47:29,11,,Middle East Development Journal,,,,,,,,,,,eoh,,EBSCOhost,,,,,,"Business Fluctuations; Cycles E32; Interest Rates: Determination, Term Structure, and Effects E43; Monetary Policy E52; Macroeconomic Analyses of Economic Development O11; Fiscal and Monetary Policy in Development O23",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2136,1,222,1587

The results we obtain indicate that the conventional wisdom holds both on individual level and on a regional basis when the monetary aggregate measures the stance of monetary policy. Moreover, an unanticipated credit expansion causes the interest rate to decline in most of the CEMAC countries. However, both the liquidity effect and the loanable effect are offset most of the time by a price puzzle or an output puzzle. In some countries, there is also an evidence of a liquidity puzzle.

We then exploit changes in monetary policy to examine whether the pass-through of borrowing costs is affected by market structure. First, we use as an experiment the announcement of the ECB Outright Monetary Transactions (OMT) program in a triple-differences specification. We show that small firms (which have low market power and higher credit constraints) in ""stressed"" countries (which benefited more from the policy) within less concentrated sectors experienced a larger reduction in credit constraints than similar firms in more concentrated sectors.

This implies relative price movements in commodities may have important consequences for economic growth and poverty reduction. Taking a long-run perspective, we examine the historical relation between a new aggregate index of commodity prices, economic activity, and interest rates. Initial empirical tests show that commodity prices present a downward trend with breaks over the entire industrial age, providing clear support for the Prebisch–Singer hypothesis. It would also appear that this trend has declined at a faster rate since the 1870s. Conversely, several GDP series such as World, Chile, China, UK, and US, trend upward with breaks. Such trending behavior in both commodity prices and economic activity suggests a latent common factor like technological innovation. To assess the relationships between economic series, we apply a stationary VAR (Vector Autoregression) to model movements around trends. Strikingly, there is evidence that commodity prices Granger cause income and interest rates, while interest rates Granger cause commodity prices. From these results and the related impulse response function analysis, the historical perspective provides some useful information for contemporary policy makers. For example, loose monetary policy has tended to support higher commodity prices. Moreover, commodity price movements have an asymmetric country effect on economic activity; periods of falling commodity prices will support GDP growth for commodity importers like the US but depress growth for commodity exporters such as Chile.",2017-01-01,2023-03-16 15:36:53,2023-03-16 15:36:53,1677609341.0,57-70,,,89,,World Development,"Long-Run Commodity Prices, Economic Growth, and Interest Rates",,,,,,,en,,,,,ScienceDirect,,,,,,VAR; interest rates; economic growth; Prebisch–Singer hypothesis; primary commodities; structural breaks,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,7428,1,122,1606

The estimation of this model, which comprises forward-looking versions of the IS and the Phillips curves as well as the interest rate rule, is conducted by GMM using quarterly data from 1986 to 2000. We find that this simple model matches the dynamic properties of the output gap, inflation and the interest rate in EMU quite accurately. We also perform several exercises that show the response of output, inflation and interest rates to different kinds of shocks affecting the economy, under the assumption that the ECB implements the monetary policy described by the estimated interest rate rule.

The Bayesian model comparison favors the notion that the dynamics are nonlinear and better described by a smooth transition between regimes, which suggests that aggregation plays a role in the dynamics between monetary policy and output. This evidence is further supported by the results of a model that uses output data at the sectoral level: when more disaggregated data are employed, the transition between regimes is more abrupt.

We focus on three representative models: the Christiano, Eichenbaum, Evans (2005) model, the Smets and Wouters (2007) model, and the Taylor (1993a) model. Although the three models differ in terms of structure, estimation method, sample period, and data vintage, we find surprisingly similar economic impacts of unanticipated changes in the federal funds rate. However, the optimal monetary policy responses to other sources of economic fluctuations are widely different in the different models. We show that simple optimal policy rules that respond to the growth rate of output and smooth the interest rate are not robust. In contrast, policy rules with no interest rate smoothing and no response to the growth rate, as distinct from the level, of output are more robust. Robustness can be improved further by optimizing rules with respect to the average loss across the three models.",2009,2023-02-13 13:34:56,2023-02-13 13:34:56,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,eoh,Availability Note: Information provided in collaboration with the RePEc Project: http://repec.org,EBSCOhost,,,,,,"Monetary Policy E52; Prices, Business Fluctuations, and Cycles: General (includes Measurement and Data) E30; Model Evaluation, Validation, and Selection C52",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1056,1,122,1644

Although sales occur very frequently, macroeconomists often filter them out because sales are not responsive to economic shocks. Using micro data underlying CPI, I demonstrate that after sales, the price index of durables goes down gradually, and that the aggregation of sales of durable goods have a significant impact on the aggregate inflation. However, sales of nondurables--the focus of previous studies--do not show these results. To study the impact of sales, I then propose a two-sector menu-cost model with the feature of sales. The model is able to match the pattern of sales and moments in the micro data. By contrast, failing to account for temporary sales in a menu-cost model would increase the output effect by 73%, and the Calvo model calibrated to the frequency of regular price changes triples the output effect. Chapter 2 examines the impact of unconventional monetary policies on the stock market when the short-term nominal interest rate is stuck at the zero lower bound. Unconventional monetary policies appear to have significant effects on stock prices and the effects differ across stocks. In agreement with existing credit channel theories, I find that firms subject to financial constraints react more strongly to unconventional monetary policy shocks (especially large-scale asset purchases) than do less constrained firms. My results imply that the credit channel is as important as the interest rate channel in the transmission of unconventional monetary policies at the zero lower bound. Chapter 3 investigates the time-varying effects of monetary policy shocks on financial markets. I show that the corporate bond market is highly responsive to monetary policy shocks throughout 2000-2012, implying a high pass-through of policy-induced movements in Treasury yields to private yields even during the zero lower bound period. While the long-term Treasury bond market is highly sensitive to monetary policy shocks throughout almost the entire sample, the short-term Treasury bond market is severely constrained by the zero lower bound. The stock market is less responsive from 2008 to 2010, but the responsiveness bounces back rapidly in 2011.",2017-06,2023-02-13 13:34:45,2023-02-13 13:34:45,,,,,,,,,,,,,"University of California, San Diego",,,,,eoh,,EBSCOhost,,,,,,"Interest Rates: Determination, Term Structure, and Effects E43; Monetary Policy E52; Financial Markets and the Macroeconomy E44; Event Studies; Information and Market Efficiency; Insider Trading G14",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,789,1,222,1645

First, financial risk-return indicators of the banking sector based on a compound option-based structural credit risk model are embedded in a large macro-financial quarterly database covering the period 2008Q4-2019Q4. Second, a SFAVAR identifies and estimates the shocks' responses relating them to the endogenous build-up of banks' vulnerabilities which are consistent with the internally coherent structure of the credit risk model. By introducing structure in the understanding of banks' asset-liability management behavior following monetary policy shocks, the research strategy contributes to disentangling results that are often mixed in the empirical literature. The study finds that unconventional monetary policy, in particular the Asset Purchase Program of the European Central Bank, seems to have been more successful than conventional monetary policy in raising output and inflation. The desired boost to bank lending has been muted and loan cyclicality has varied across countries and loan types. The performance of the banking sector following monetary policy shocks can be characterized by a drop in expected return on equity and assets, a relaxation of lending conditions and increased correlation between banks' assets return and the market return, a mechanism pointing to enhanced risk-taking. While banks' probabilities of default fall following monetary policy shocks, the price of risk increases. Banks' net worth rises via higher market capitalization and implied assets value together with lower volatility, despite often incurring more debt. Risk-taking in the banking sector may pose a risk to financial stability, especially if its effects on banks' vulnerability spread and increase systemic risk. The unintended endogenous build-up of macro-financial vulnerabilities may need to become part of monetary policymaking.",2022-12,2023-02-13 13:34:31,2023-02-13 13:34:31,,,,Query date: 2023-02-07 15:13:56,63,,Journal of Financial Stability,,,,,,,,,,,eoh,,EBSCOhost,,,,,,Inflation; Deflation E31; Macroeconomics: Production E23; Monetary Policy E52; Price Level; Financial Crises G01; Financial Markets and the Macroeconomy E44; Banks; Depository Institutions; Micro Finance Institutions; Mortgages G21; Financial Institutions and Services: Government Policy and Regulation G28,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,453,1,111,1646

The results from the equation estimated through 1980 are used to examine the behavior of inflation during the 1981-82 recession, and to predict the behavior of inflation and unemployment that would ac-company alternative paths of nominal GNP growth after 1982.The role of velocity is examined in a new set of multivariate exogeneity tests using the vector-autoregressive (VAR) approach for three separate sample periods (1953-61, 1962-70, and 1971-79).The major conclusions are that the monetary base has no significant explanatory role for spending changes.

Merging loans database with employment data from RAIS (Annual Social Information Report), we also investigate the effects of monetary policy rate on employment. Our results indicate that changes in policy rate have smaller effect on the level of employment for firms with more access to earmarked and government-owned banks loans. Additionally, we examine whether firms with larger fraction of governmentdriven loans are better able to insulate themselves from the effects of external shocks, with resulting attenuated impact of those shocks on loans growth, interest rate on private loans and employment growth.

Observing the transmission of ECB's interest rate (the shock) to gross domestic product (GDP) growth (the response), the results of variance decompositions and impulse responses indicate that interest rate channel works countercyclical in general. However, while stabilizing (countercyclical) effect is evident for the core (especially Germany), it is almost absent in the case of Greece.

Relative to policy shock identification, technology shock identification implies: (i) long duration durability in preferences instead of short duration habit, (ii) built-in inflation inertia disappears and price flexibility increases. In response to technological improvement, consumption durability increases hours worked because households temporarily increase labor supply to accumulate durables towards a new, higher steady state level.

This thesis examines its effects on the transmission of monetary policy through the bank lending channel, and its effects on output in the host countries. The first essay develops a general equilibrium model to address the questions: 1) does the economy with a higher foreign bank penetration respond in the same way to external and internal shocks as one with a lower penetration; and 2) can domestic monetary policy still be used effectively to stabilize the foreign bank-dominant economy. We examine the propagation of external and internal shocks and the effectiveness of monetary policy in two alternative scenarios: an economy dominated by domestic banks and an economy dominated by foreign banks. By applying numerical simulation methods, we find that an economy with the foreign bank-dominant banking sector is associated with lower loan interest rates, more credit, and higher output, wage and employment, compared to a domestic bank-dominant economy. Moreover, the foreign bank-dominant economy is shown to be less responsive to changes in domestic monetary policy. This suggests that, in order to isolate the domestic output from the effect of external shocks, central banks in the foreign bank-dominant economies need to conduct the monetary policy more cautiously, taking into account a buffer effect from the presence of foreign banks. Overall we conclude that foreign banks play the role of a stabilizing force in the host economies, but the effectiveness of monetary policy is reduced due to the presence of foreign banks in these foreign bank-dominant economies. The second essay examines empirical evidence of the bank lending channel of the monetary policy by comparing the responses of domestic and foreign banks to domestic monetary policy shocks at the individual bank level. We investigate the effects of domestic and foreign ownership on the loan lending and deposit taking behavior of more than 1200 banks in the emerging economies in Eastern & Central Europe, Latin America and Asia over the period from 1996 to 2003. We employ pooled OLS and panel VAR methods, and find evidence for the existence of the varying degree of a bank lending channel across banks with different international ownership. Foreign banks are shown to be less responsive to domestic monetary policy shocks, that is, they adjust their loan and deposit growth rates less than domestic private banks. This lower sensitivity to domestic monetary policy by foreign banks can be explained by foreign banks' access to the internal capital market of their parent banks. The evidence from aggregated data also shows that the effects of monetary policy on total bank loans tend to be lower in economies with higher foreign bank penetration level. The third essay examines the implications of foreign bank penetration on resource allocation in host countries. It finds some evidence that foreign banks tend to have labor better allocated to more productive sectors. The effect of output reduction on unemployment rate is buffered in economies with higher foreign bank penetration level. This evidence is interpreted as consistent with a better labor allocation associated with foreign bank participation. This effect is still significant after controlling for the degree of competitiveness in banking sector, which could be interpreted as consistent with the hypothetical ""direct effect"" of foreign bank penetration on economic growth. However, the effect of capital on economic growth is not found significantly different with different level of foreign bank penetration. Overall, these findings suggest that the effects of foreign bank penetration on economic growth are modest and should not be overstated.",2008,2023-02-13 13:34:54,2023-02-13 13:34:54,,,,,,,,,,,,,Drexel University,,,,,eoh,,EBSCOhost,,,,,,Banks; Depository Institutions; Micro Finance Institutions; Mortgages G21; Corporate Finance and Governance O16; Economic Development: Financial Markets; Saving and Capital Investment; International Business F23; Multinational Firms; Socialist Institutions and Their Transitions: Financial Economics P34,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1013,1,222,1685

Second, in contrast to the existing TVAR literature, which concentrates exclusively on single-threshold models, we allow for the presence of a second threshold, which is overwhelmingly supported by all relevant statistical tests. Our results indicate that the dynamics of the interactions among credit market conditions, monetary policy and economic activity change considerably as the economy moves from one phase of the business cycle to another and that single-threshold TVAR models are too restrictive to fully capture the nonlinear nature of those interactions.

Evidence Based on VAR Estimates,,,,10.2139/ssrn.1440241,https://papers.ssrn.com/abstract=1440241,"Empirical evidence on whether the euro area monetary transmission process has changed is, at best, mixed. We argue that this inconclusiveness is likely to be due to the fact that existing empirical studies concentrate on the effects of a particular development on a specific transmission channel. Another problem of this literature is that specific changes could have off-setting effects regarding the overall effectiveness of monetary policy, leaving open the question whether the ability of monetary policy to control inflation has been altered. In order to shed light on this issue, we investigate whether there has been a significant change in the overall transmission of monetary policy to inflation and output by estimating a standard VAR for the euro area and by searching for a possible break date. We find a significant break point around 1996 and some evidence for a second one around 1999. We compare impulse responses to a monetary policy shock for these episodes and find that the well-known 'stylised facts' of monetary policy transmission remain valid. Therefore, we argue that the general guiding principles of the Eurosystem monetary policy remain adequate. Moreover, it seems that monetary transmission after 1998 is not very different from before 1996, but probably very different in the interim period. This implies that evidence for the euro area could be biased by an 'atypical' interim period 1996-1999.

However, little work has investigated how the market structure of banks can affect the transmission of monetary policy. The purpose of this paper is to investigate to what degree bank concentration dampens or enhances the response of manufacturing to monetary policy changes. Design/methodology/approach To test how back concentration affects the transmission of monetary policy onto manufacturing value-added, the author regresses real value-added in manufacturing on bank concentration, monetary policy and the interaction of these two variables. The data set consists of a panel of 22 OECD countries across 59 manufacturing sectors from 1993 to 2005. Findings The author finds that bank concentration has two distinct effects: growth in manufacturing is lower in countries with higher concentration and manufacturing is less responsive to monetary policy as well. A loosening of monetary policy by lowering interest rates has a significantly larger effect on growth in countries with lower banking concentration. Overall, a 1 per cent decrease in the monetary policy interest rate increases industrial growth by 0.049 per cent when the three-bank concentration ratio is equal to the sample average, but the same monetary policy change has roughly twice the effect if bank concentration is only 5 per cent lower, all else equal.

Finally, the case of two step variations of monetary policy with opposite amounts is considered for the circumstance when a first monetary change does not give the desired result and it is needed to go back to the previous monetary condition; we find that their total effects are reversible only asymptotically, but in a relatively short time the total effect may be negligible.

Knightian uncertainty about the precision of the policy signal and ambiguity-averse preferences give rise to the ambiguous signaling channel of monetary policy.

This paper uses a simple model of Australian output to estimate the length of the lags, and then examines how attempts to grapple with the estimation problems might change the results. We estimate that output growth falls by about one-third of one per cent in both the first and second years after a one percentage point rise in the short-term real interest rate, and by about one-sixth of one per cent in the third year. This implies an average lag of about five or six quarters in monetary policy's impact on output growth. Each of these estimates is, however, subject to considerable uncertainty. We discuss the implications for policy of these relatively long and uncertain lags. Finally, we find no evidence that the average lag from monetary policy to output growth has become any shorter in the 1990s.",1999,2023-03-16 15:48:55,2023-03-16 15:48:55,1678472132.0,280-294,,3,75,,,,,,,,,,en,,,,,Wiley Online Library,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,10548,1,111,1712

In this essay, I aim to further our understandings of the internal workings of financial intermediaries, how they interact in financial networks, and how they affect monetary policy and the macroeconomy. In the first chapter, James Peck and I study a bank run model where the depositors can choose how much to deposit. In the many years and many published articles following the bank runs paper of Diamond and Dybvig (1983), only a few papers have modeled the decision of whether to deposit, much less the decision of how much to deposit. The questions we address here are, how does the opportunity for consumers to invest outside the banking system--in investments that do not provide liquidity insurance--(1) affect the nature of the final allocation, (2) affect the nature of the optimal deposit contract, and (3) affect the fragility of the banking system? We extend the Diamond and Dybvig (1983) model so to incorporate sequential service constraint and the opportunity of outside investments and show that under certain conditions the equilibrium entails partial deposits, thus arguing for the optimality of limited banking. One might think that when depositors are allowed to invest a fraction of their endowments outside the banking system, they would be hedging against the risk of a run occurring, but losing out on some of the services provided by banks. Thus, one might think that this would improve the stability of the financial system at the expense of lost efficiency. However, we show that the opposite could be true, with reduced stability (runs more likely) but higher efficiency! In the second chapter, I study the strategic behavior of heterogeneous banks in a network and its implications on the stability of the financial system. I construct a model alas Allen and Gale (2000) wherein banks differ in whether they are hit by an uninsurable excess liquidity demand. I show that in such a framework banks that are already facing a high liquidity demand are more likely to incur the burden of excess liquidity shocks even when that shock has not directly hit them, i.e. relatively healthier banks strategically pass liquidation costs to relatively less healthy banks. I also show that private bailouts arise endogenously in this framework. If the strategic behavior of a bank results in the other bank's failure, the first bank may choose to incur the burden of the liquidity shock by itself to let the other bank survive and, thus, to control the indirect costs of failure feeding back to its portfolio. I also show that for some economies the financial network becomes more stable as the level of cross-deposits is increased from the minimum level that fully insures banks against liquidity demand uncertainty up to a threshold level. In the third chapter, I study the role of financial intermediaries in the transmission of monetary policy in low interest rate environments. The global financial crisis not only proved our understanding of intermediaries were inaccurate and in many ways misleading but also provided an unprecedented opportunity to investigate the questions in ways that were not possible before. Among those, was the behavior of economic players in ultra-low and even negative market rates. I study the internal workings of intermediaries by exploiting geographical variation in market concentration and provide the first explanation for the gradual deterioration of monetary policy power in low market rates that does not rely on bank-specific characteristics and similarly applies to non-bank intermediaries. I show that--in stark contrast to the textbook view but consistent with my mechanism--in low market rates more concentrated banks respond to market rate falls by reducing their deposit supply as well as their loan supply by more than those of less concentrated banks. I argue this behavior is the response of banks to loan and deposit demand becoming less elastic to market rate changes in low market rates which itself is due to the shift of household assets from the ones that are fully responsive to market rate changes (e.g. money market funds) to those less responsive (e.g. deposits) or irresponsive (e.g. cash) in low market rates. As the market rate falls, The downward pressure of the increased market power and the upward pressure of the traditional channels, cause the non-monotonic response of banks to market rate changes. The results help explain the puzzling slow recovery of the economy as well as stable inflation after the global financial crisis. I also show that local house prices become less responsive to market rate changes in low market rates in the counties that are exposed to high-market-power banks.",2022-05,2023-02-13 13:35:14,2023-02-13 13:35:14,,,,,,,,,,,,,Ohio State University,,,,,eoh,,EBSCOhost,,,,,,Inflation; Deflation E31; Monetary Policy E52; Price Level; Financial Crises G01; Financial Markets and the Macroeconomy E44; Banks; Depository Institutions; Micro Finance Institutions; Mortgages G21; Housing Supply and Markets R31,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1486,1,222,1718

Using detailed data on lending conditions and standards, we analyse – along several key dimensions of heterogeneity – how financial fragility has affected the transmission mechanism of the single eurozone monetary policy. The analysis shows that the monetary transmission mechanism is time-varying and influenced by the financial fragility of the sovereigns, banks, firms and households. The impact of monetary policy on aggregate output is stronger during the financial crisis, especially in countries facing increased sovereign financial distress. This amplification mechanism, moreover, operates through the credit channel, both the bank lending and the non-financial borrower balance-sheet channels. Our results suggest that the bank-lending channel has been to a large extent neutralized by the ECB non-standard monetary policy interventions, but the policy framework until the end of 2011 was insufficient to overcome credit availability problems stemming from deteriorated firm net worth and risk conditions, especially for small firms in countries under stress.— Matteo Ciccarelli, Angela Maddaloni and José-Luis Peydró",2013-07-01,2023-03-16 15:43:45,2023-03-16 15:43:45,1678311946.0,459-512,,75,28,,Economic Policy,Heterogeneous transmission mechanism,,,,,,,,,,,,Silverchair,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,9033,1,221,1721

The exchange rate was the main channel of monetary policy transmission during that time frame. Furthermore, inflation sensitivity to the interest rate is low. Thus, a rise in the basic interest rate (Selic) generates relatively small benefits (a fall in inflation). However, an interest rate increase generates substantial costs: a slowdown in economic activity, the appreciation of the exchange rate, and an increase in public debt. Inflations low sensitivity to interest rates is seen as a result of problems in the transmission mechanism: a broken transmission mechanism reduces the efficiency of monetary policy. Price stability under ITR thus requires an excessively rigid monetary policy. The final outcome is, on the one hand, that inflation hardly gives in. 0n the other hand, the costs of high interest rates escalate.

Nations are bound together by a network of trading and financial relationships. These relationships have been growing stronger in various ways during the last decades. This means that countries may be particularly vulnerable to economic disturbances originating in other parts of the world, especially if they rely heavily on international trade. Thus, though booms and depressions usually being in the more highly developed economies, they spread more quickly to less developed countries whose economies are closely linked to the export of a few basic raw materials products. This sensitivity to outside cyclical disturbances holds also for the less developed countries when their financial markets are underdeveloped. The increasing fluctuations in the oil prices through the last decades have been transferred to the oil exporting countries. Thus, many oil exporting countries experienced significant changes in the economic activity due to changes in the oil markets. In light of this, oil exporting countries have attempted to implement a policy that would stabilize the fluctuations in the oil markets recognizing the adverse effects of such behavior on oil exporting countries, as well as oil importing countries. Saudi Arabia, as the largest oil-exporting country and a member of OPEC, takes the role of oil-markets stabilizer by behaving as the swing producer. This role has caused the global economic fluctuations to transfer into the domestic economy. In addition, Saudi Arabian government has adopted a fixed exchange rate currency regime. Although it has contributed to domestic price stabilizations, this policy has also exposed the country to global economic disturbances. The purpose of this study is to empirically investigate these aspects for Saudi Arabia. First, the effects of shocks originated in the international markets on the Saudi Arabian economy. Second, how the fixed exchange rate regimes influences the domestic macroeconomic variables. Third, to what extent the oil sector contributes to the non-oil domestic fluctuations. Finally, how the finding from the study can be explained by economic theory. In pursuing this, there are four economic theories that are considered to explain the causes of business cycles. These theories are Classical Theory, Keynesian Theory, Monetarist Theory, and the Real Business Cycles. In addition, a theoretical model is derived that is suitable for an oil-based economy. The model follows the set up of McCallum and Nelson (1999). Then, the empirical models of Structural Vector Autoregression (SVAR) and Error Correction Model (ECM) are implemented with three different specifications: Choleski Decomposition, Block Exogeneity and long-run Cointegration Model. The empirical models then are applied to sets of data from 1980 to 2002 for Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Venezuela and Norway. The rationale of including other oil-exporting countries is to distinguish whether the shocks are country-specific, regional-specific, or global. Two sets of shocks are considered: international shocks and domestic shocks. Three types of international shocks are chosen: commodity-price (oil price) shock, international financial (interest rate) shock, and international real (output) shock. In addition, five domestic shocks which are non-oil output shock, oil production shock, price level shock, monetary shock, and exchange rate shock. The findings reached in the study demonstrate that the international shocks are responsible for a high proportion of fluctuations in the economic activity in Saudi Arabia. Most importantly, the international financial shocks represented by the US interest rate and oil price shocks are the major sources of fluctuations in the Saudi Arabian economy. Domestically, the economy is mostly affected by the oil production and the non-oil output shocks for Saudi Arabia. These results emphasize that the Saudi Arabia's role in the international oil market and its fixed exchange rate regime have significant implications on the domestic economy. Thus, special consideration should be placed on the designing the appropriate policies to lessen the dependency on the oil sector and strengthen the role of private sector to diversify the economic base, and provide an independent sound monetary policy to steer the economy from the fluctuations in the global economy.",2004,2023-02-13 13:37:21,2023-02-13 13:37:21,,,,,,,,,,,,,Clark University,,,,,eoh,,EBSCOhost,,,,,,Business Fluctuations; Cycles E32; Macroeconomic Analyses of Economic Development O11; Economic Growth of Open Economies F43; Energy; Economic Development: Agriculture; Environment; Natural Resources; Other Primary Products O13; Exhaustible Resources and Economic Development Q32,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,4418,1,222,1742

Overall, these results not only shed new light on the policy factors behind China's economic fluctuations, but also provide new evidence that is helpful for understanding the policy transmission mechanisms in China.",2016-03,2023-02-13 13:35:31,2023-02-13 13:35:31,,25-45,,1,30,,Asian Economic Journal,,,,,,,,,,,eoh,,EBSCOhost,,,,,,"Business Fluctuations; Cycles E32; Monetary Policy E52; General Aggregative Models: Neoclassical E13; Fiscal Policy E62; Macroeconomic Analyses of Economic Development O11; Inflation P24; Money; Socialist Systems and Transitional Economies: National Income, Product, and Expenditure; Socialist Institutions and Their Transitions: Public Economics P35",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1878,1,222,1745

The results show that Indian monetary policy responds to tax rebate shocks and spending shocks differently. In the case of a tax rebate shock, Indian monetary policy responds by reducing interest rates thereby accommodating fiscal expansion. On the opposite, monetary policy seems not to accommodate expenditure shocks. Interestingly, the monetary policy shock is accompanied by a fiscal expansion that threatens the credibility of the central bank actions, thus indicating fiscal policy dominance.

The first essay studies the interaction between monetary policy, financial markets, and the real economy. The second essay shifts the focus to fiscal policy. Both essays employ Markov-switching Bayesian vector autoregressions (MS-BVARs) to determine whether there were regime changes in U.S. monetary and fiscal policy over the last 60 years. In the first essay, I evaluate the roles of short- and long-term private and government interest rates and inside and outside money in the monetary transmission mechanism. With money and credit markets present, changes in monetary policy set off a chain of relative price and portfolio adjustments affecting output and prices. I study interest rate and money supply rules within this monetary transmission mechanism by estimating several MS-BVARs on a quarterly U.S. sample from 1960 to 2018. The best-fit MS-BVAR restricts MS to the impact and lag coefficients of the monetary policy and money demand regressions and the stochastic volatilities (SVs) of the structural shocks. Estimates of this MS-BVAR yield evidence of a SV regime that coincides with NBER dated recessions. This MS-BVAR also identifies a regime switch in the Fed's interest rate rule and banks' demand for reserves around the dot-com bust of 2000 and again from the 2007-2009 recession and financial crisis to the end of the sample. Counterfactual simulations show the 2007-2009 recession and financial crisis would have not been as deep and long-lasting if the fed funds rate had been as low as -8% in 2009 and remained negative from 2010 through 2016. In the second essay, I measure the effects of government spending and tax shocks on U.S. output in a MS-BVAR. Motivation for estimating a MS-BVAR rests on the idea that MSBVARs account for anticipation effects caused by households, workers, firms, and investors reacting to announcements of future fiscal policy changes. The best-fit MS-BVAR produces several interesting results about fiscal multipliers. First, the government spending multiplier is near one during expansions but ranges from 1.5 to 2 during recessions. Second, there is no strong evidence of a negative tax multiplier. This finding is at odds with a number of studies reporting tax multipliers ranging from -2 to -3. Comparing the estimated fiscal multipliers lends support to traditional Keynesian theory, which predicts U.S. output responds more to government spending shocks than to tax shocks.",2022-06,2023-02-13 13:35:20,2023-02-13 13:35:20,,,,,,,,,,,,,North Carolina State University,,,,,eoh,,EBSCOhost,,,,,,"Interest Rates: Determination, Term Structure, and Effects E43; Macroeconomics: Production E23; Monetary Policy E52; Financial Markets and the Macroeconomy E44; Banks; Depository Institutions; Micro Finance Institutions; Mortgages G21; Fiscal Policy; Modern Monetary Theory E62",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1640,1,122,1754

I suggest that the conventional notion of a monetary policy shock as a surprise change in the fed funds rate is misspecified. The primary news for market participants is not what the Fed just did, but is instead new information about what the Fed is going to do in the near future. Revisions in these anticipations show up instantaneously in long-term mortgage rates. Although mortgage rates respond well before the Fed actually changes its target rate, home sales do not respond until much later. The paper attributes this delay to cross-sectional heterogeneity in search times.

The analysis proceeds in three stages. First, industry price and output responses to unanticipated changes in the federal funds rate are examined. Second, the effect of industry characteristics on these responses is analyzed. Finally, the paper assesses whether particular industry characteristics are associated with price rigidity or interest rate sensitivity. The results in this paper support the following conclusions. Durable good industries exhibit larger price and output responses to federal funds rate shocks than nondurable good industries. This suggests that durable good industries are more sensitive to interest rate shocks than nondurable good industries and is consistent with the observation that durable good industries are more cyclical than nondurable good industries. High concentration industries are found to exhibit smaller price responses and larger output responses to unanticipated changes in the federal funds rate than low concentration industries. Thus, price rigidity may be an important determinant of how high concentration industries respond to federal fund rate shocks. Industries with high inventory-to-sales ratios are associated with smaller price and output responses to interest rate shocks than industries with low inventory-to-sales ratios. This suggests that industries whose output is storable are able to smooth price and output responses to demand shocks through inventory adjustment.",1996,2023-02-13 13:34:56,2023-02-13 13:34:56,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,eoh,Availability Note: Information provided in collaboration with the RePEc Project: http://repec.org,EBSCOhost,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1054,1,112,1768

The papers are from a range of core and smaller advanced economies, and emerging markets . The main findings are as follows. First, there is evidence that macroprudential policy in recipient countries can partly offset the spillover effects of monetary policy conducted in core countries. Meanwhile, domestic macroprudential policy in core countries can also affect the cross-border transmission of domestic monetary policy via lending abroad, by limiting the increase in lending by less strongly capitalized banks. Second, the findings highlight that studying heterogeneities across banks provides complementary insights to studies using more aggregate data and focusing on average effects. In particular, we find that individual bank characteristics such as bank size or GSIB status play a first-order role in the transmission of these policies.

The size of the balance of payments offset is relatively large, but the models differ on its size. Domestic credit appears to have a weak effect on national output. Neither domestic credit nor the exchange rate play much of a role in explaining variation in inflation in Colombia. Inflation appears to be primarily inertial and the result of demand shocks.

Olivei and Tenreyro argue that this finding reflects the fact that a greater fraction of wage rates are re-contracted in the second half of the year, implying that wages (and prices) are less flexible in the first half. In this paper, I assess this explanation in light of several additional empirical results. Most importantly, I demonstrate that within-year differences in the responses of output and prices following a monetary policy shock are not more pronounced in the service-producing sector, where labor costs represent a larger fraction of total production costs.

Demand- and supply-side constraints are both relevant. On the supply side, price flexibility may be the result of structural and/or institutional constraints that warrant a larger degree of price adjustment in the face of demand fluctuations. On the demand side, structural constraints may hinder the transmission mechanism of demand fluctuations, resulting in an inelastic aggregate demand in the face of policy adjustments. Using data for 50 developing countries, supply-side constraints do not differentiate the transmission mechanism of policy shocks to price inflation and output growth. In contrast, a larger demand shift in the face of monetary and government spending shocks increases the real and inflationary effects of policy shocks. The pronounced evidence of upward price flexibility points to the importance of addressing supply-side capacity constraints to counter inflationary pressures in developing countries. Equally important is to analyse determinants of private spending to identify channels for influencing aggregate spending and maximizing the effectiveness of stabilization policies.",2006-06,2023-02-13 13:35:36,2023-02-13 13:35:36,,117-149,,2,34,,Oxford Development Studies,,,,,,,,,,,eoh,,EBSCOhost,,,,,,Inflation; Deflation E31; Macroeconomics: Production E23; Monetary Policy E52; Price Level; Comparative or Joint Analysis of Fiscal and Monetary Policy; Stabilization; Treasury Policy E63; Fiscal Policy E62; Macroeconomic Analyses of Economic Development O11; Fiscal and Monetary Policy in Development O23,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1996,1,221,1788

With greater reliance on government transfers, thus smaller reliance on labor income, and relatively larger food consumption, these individuals appear to benefit mainly from lower inflation.

The method considers multiple posteriors for the set-identified models and combines them with a single posterior for models that are either point-identified or that impose nondogmatic assumptions. The output is a set of posteriors (post-averaging ambiguous belief), which can be summarized by reporting the set of posterior means and the associated credible region. We clarify when the prior model probabilities are updated and characterize the asymptotic behavior of the posterior model probabilities. The method provides a formal framework for conducting sensitivity analysis of empirical findings to the choice of identifying assumptions. For example, we find that in a standard monetary model one would need to attach a prior probability greater than 0.28 to the validity of the assumption that prices do not react contemporaneously to a monetary policy shock, in order to obtain a negative response of output to the shock.",2022-01,2023-02-13 13:35:06,2023-02-13 13:35:06,,95-123,,1,13,,Quantitative Economics,,,,,,,,,,,eoh,,EBSCOhost,,,,,,Business Fluctuations; Cycles E32; Macroeconomics: Production E23; Monetary Policy E52; Bayesian Analysis: General C11,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1271,1,221,1812

Second, while Bayesian posterior odds favor the full-information version of the model, the fall of interest rates, actual and expected inflation in the early 1980s is better captured by the delayed response of the learning specification.

Using quarterly bilateral Canadian-US data, we find such an interest rate rule to have little explanatory power for the early part of our sample starting in the mid-1980s, but to become more suitable to explain interest rate dynamics from the mid-1990s onwards. Whereas the exchange rate turns out to be the major determinant of the policy rate in the 1980s, its importance declines throughout the 1990s and 2000s, although it continues to be influential even towards the end of the sample period ending in 2015Q2. We also find interest rate shocks to have become more effective in influencing the macroeconomy over time, indicating that the BoC has continually gained monetary policy credibility. We associate this development with the BoC successively de-emphasizing the role of the exchange rate in informing interest rate decisions, thereby alleviating the potential monetary policy conflict between targeting the exchange rate and maintaining the price stability goal.",2018-09,2023-02-13 13:35:09,2023-02-13 13:35:09,,471-494,,2,55,,Empirical Economics,,,,,,,,,,,eoh,,EBSCOhost,,,,,,"Inflation; Deflation E31; Foreign Exchange F31; Interest Rates: Determination, Term Structure, and Effects E43; Macroeconomics: Production E23; Monetary Policy E52; Price Level; Diffusion Processes; Dynamic Quantile Regressions; Dynamic Treatment Effect Models; Multiple or Simultaneous Equation Models: Time-Series Models; State Space Models C32",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1356,1,111,1821

The impulse responses analysis results conform to our expectations. An interest rate shock (or contractionary monetary policy shock) causes exchange rate (KRW/foreign) to fall (or Korean Won to appreciate) and trade balance to worsen. Money supply shocks lead to a depreciation of the Korean Won and an improvement of the trade balance. Price level shocks cause the Korean Won to depreciate and the trade balance to improve. The output shocks lead to an appreciation of the Korean Won, worsening the trade balance. In addition, the exchange rate depreciation shock of the Korean Won leads to an improvement in the trade balance.

If, however, the increase in the real interest rate also increases the probability of default on the debt, the effect may be instead to make domestic government debt less attractive, and to lead to a real depreciation. That outcome is more likely the higher the initial level of debt, the higher the proportion of foreign-currency-denominated debt, and the higher the price of risk. Under that outcome, inflation targeting can clearly have perverse effects: An increase in the real interest in response to higher inflation leads to a real depreciation. The real depreciation leads in turn to a further increase in inflation. In this case, fiscal policy, not monetary policy, is the right instrument to decrease inflation. This paper argues that this is the situation the Brazilian economy found itself in in 2002 and 2003. It presents a model of the interaction between the interest rate, the exchange rate, and the probability of default, in a high-debt high-risk-aversion economy such as Brazil during that period. It then estimates the model, using Brazilian data. It concludes that, in 2002, the level and the composition of public debt in Brazil, and the general level of risk aversion in world financial markets, were indeed such as to imply perverse effects of the interest rate on the exchange rate and on inflation.",2004-03,2023-03-16 15:45:14,2023-03-16 15:45:14,1678378355.0,,,,,,,Fiscal Dominance and Inflation Targeting,,,,,,,,,,,,National Bureau of Economic Research,,Publisher: National Bureau of Economic Research,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,9521,1,221,1834

To that end, among many others, budgetary flexibility can be increased through creating fiscal space and growthfriendly tax and spending reforms can be undertaken without jeopardizing the trade-off between growth and equity while giving priority to proper coordination of fiscal policy with monetary policy.",2021,2023-03-16 15:46:00,2023-03-16 15:46:00,1678446088.0,,,4,68,,,Fiscal and monetary policy effectiveness in turkey,,,,,,,eng,,,,,avesis.aybu.edu.tr,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,9781,1,222,1856

Estimation results show that the SOE and CE models lead to qualitatively similar estimates for the Canadian economy. Also, the effects of monetary policy shocks, and of other domestic shocks, generated in the SOE model resemble to those generated in the CE model.

To correctly identify innovations in changes in legal reserve requirements, we develop a narrative approach--based on contemporaneous reports from the IMF and Central Banks in the spirit of Romer and Romer (2010)--that classifies each change into endogenous or exogenous to the business cycle. We show that this distinction is critical in understanding the macroeconomic effects of reserve requirements. In particular, we show that output falls in response to exogenous increases in legal reserve requirements but would seem not to be affected (or could even increase!) when using all changes and relying on traditional time-identifying strategies. This bias reflects the practical relevance of the misidentification of endogenous countercyclical changes in reserve requirements. We also push the empirical frontier along two important dimensions. First, in measuring legal reserve requirements, we take into account both the different types of legal reserve requirements in terms of maturity and currency of denomination as well as the structure of deposits. Second, since in practice reserve requirement policy is tightly linked to monetary policy, we also jointly analyze the macroeconomic effects of changes in central bank interest rates.

These open-economy models can be grouped into two economic paradigms. The first is the ""conventional"" paradigm (or Phillips curve paradigm) and the second is the ""money matters"" paradigm. Under the conventional paradigm, inflation is determined by price adjustments in response to inflation expectations and by factor disequilibrium in labour or product markets. Under the money matters paradigm, inflation is determined mainly by monetary disequilibrium. Although most models are based on the conventional paradigm, there are nevertheless important differences within that paradigm. In particular, there are differences in the inflation process (linear/non-linear Phillips curve), the channels through which monetary policy affects the economy (short-term interest rates or the yield curve), and the sensitivity of output and inflation to changes in interest rates and the exchange rate. The authors also examine the dynamic properties of the various models when those models use the simple monetary reaction function proposed by [Taylor, J. B. (1993). Discretion versus policy rules in practice. Carnegie-Rochester Conference Series on Public Policy, 39, 195-214].

A major issue that is dealt with is the weakening of the interaction of monetary and fiscal policies in Ukraine. It can be assumed that one of the reasons hindering economic growth is growing discoordination between monetary and fiscal policies. The purpose of this study is to assess the nature of monetary and fiscal policies in Ukraine in 2000–2017 and justify the need for coordination between them to stimulate economic growth. For the quantitative assessment of the influence of monetary and fiscal factors on GDP, the models of autoregression with distributed lags – ARDL are used. The analysis makes it possible to distinguish and characterize three stages of combining the rigid and stimulating monetary and fiscal policy in Ukraine in 2000–2017.

In contrast, monetary policy shocks only have insignificant effects during a household leveraging state. These results are robust to alternative definitions of leveraging and deleveraging periods, different ways of identifying monetary policy shocks, controlling for the state of the business cycle, the level of households debt, and financial stress. To provide a structural interpretation for these empirical findings, we estimate a monetary DSGE model with financial frictions and occasionally binding collateral constraints. The model estimates reveal that household deleveraging periods in the data on average coincide with periods of binding collateral constraints whereas constraints tend to turn slack during leveraging episodes. Moreover, the model produces an amplification of monetary policy shocks that is quantitatively comparable to our empirical estimates. These findings indicate that the state-dependent tightness of collateral constraints accounts for the asymmetric effects of monetary policy across the household leverage cycle as found in the data.",2019-06-01,2023-03-16 15:43:50,2023-03-16 15:43:50,1678313702.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,en,,,,,Social Science Research Network,,"Place: Rochester, NY",,,,monetary policy; household leverage; occasionally binding constraints,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,9104,1,221,1874

In particular, I propose and quantify a novel channel to explain how population aging might affect the effectiveness of monetary policy and the flattening of the Phillips curve: older individuals purchase more from product categories with higher levels of price rigidity--categories which adjust their prices less often--so the aggregate frequency of price adjustment decreases as the population ages. Using micro data on consumer expenditure, I document the negative relationship between age and the frequency of price adjustment and find that it is mainly due to the higher share of services consumed by old households. At the macro level, if prices are more rigid output should respond more to monetary shocks. To test this hypothesis, I exploit the cross-sectional variation in demographic structures across the U.S. and I show that the economic activity in states with a higher old-age dependency ratio reacts more to monetary shocks. Finally, I rationalise these findings using a two-sector OLG New Keynesian model where demographic trends shift aggregate demand towards services, i.e., the stickier expenditure category. Combining the model with population projections for the U.S., I find that the changes in the age distribution between 1980 and 2010 increased the contemporaneous response of output to monetary shocks by 6% and will have increased it by 10% in 2050. Moreover, demographic trends explain around 10% of the decrease in the slope of the Phillips curve.",2022,2023-02-13 13:35:57,2023-02-13 13:35:57,,66-pp.,,Query date: 2023-02-09 16:59:31,,,,,,,,,,,,,,eoh,Availability Note: Information provided in collaboration with the RePEc Project: http://repec.org,EBSCOhost,,,,,,"Monetary Policy E52; Demographic Trends, Macroeconomic Effects, and Forecasts J11",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2493,1,222,1884

Given the large differences in economic and financial structures among the EMU member states, monetary policy is likely to affect different member economies in different ways.

The second part consists of papers analyzing the political economy of monetary policy in a monetary union of heterogeneous regions or member states.  The papers all support the conclusion that regional differences in the responses to a common monetary policy will make European monetary policy especially difficult in the years to come. Such differences arise from a variety of sources, and they cannot be expected to be mere teething troubles that will disappear after a while.

The model has two aggregate shocks: a monetary policy shock and a technology shock. Firms observe idiosyncratic noisy signals about these shocks and face strategic complementarities in price setting. In this environment, agents'""forecasting the forecasts of others"" can produce realistic dynamics of model variables, with associated highly persistent real effects of monetary shocks and delayed effects of such shocks on inflation. The paper provides a full Bayesian analysis of the model, revealing that it can capture the persistent propagation of monetary shocks only by predicting that firms acquire less information about monetary policy than about technology. To further investigate this finding, I augment the model to allow firms to optimally choose how much information to acquire about the two shocks, subject to an information-processing constraint a la Sims (2003). This constraint sets the rate at which firms can substitute pieces of information about the two shocks. I find that, in the estimated model, firms' marginal value of the information about monetary policy shocks is much higher than that about technology shocks. I argue that this finding admits two alternative interpretations. First, firms acquire implausibly too little information about the monetary shock in the estimated model. Second, the rate of substitution implied by the information-processing constraint is inconsistent with the data. In the third chapter, I develop a model where firms have incomplete and dispersed information to study how monetary policy effects agents' beliefs. I estimate the model through Bayesian methods and find that dispersed information has two main implications for monetary policy. First, it reduces the real effects of money.

The estimated monetary policy reaction functions show Macedonia and Slovakia as inflation targeters, with Macedonia as the more conservative one, despite its officially applied exchange rate targeting regime. The differences in the estimated parameters imply differing transmission mechanisms for Macedonia and Slovakia. Consequently, the variance of domestic variables in Slovakia is most influenced by monetary policy shocks, while there is no single dominating shock explaining the volatility of Macedonia's macroeconomic variables. The exchange rate shock, the monetary policy shock and the demand shock are jointly important in determining the volatility of Macedonia's variables.

In a prediction analysis we find that, out of a set of alternative plausible endogenous model variables, the level of household net worth is the single best predictor of the tightness of the borrowing constraint, which implies that monetary policy is more effective when household net worth is low. We test this model prediction in the data and provide robust empirical evidence on asymmetric effects of monetary policy across the household net worth cycle that validates the model predictions. A contractionary monetary policy shock leads to a large and significant fall in economic activity during periods of low household net worth.

On the one hand, exposure to global financial cycles dampens the output effect of a tightening in monetary policy in financially integrated economies and thereby reduces monetary policy effectiveness. On the other hand, another salient feature of financial globalisation is that economies have become increasingly net long in foreign currency, which amplifies monetary policy effectiveness: economies experience larger valuation losses and wealth effects on their external balance sheets in response to an exchange rate appreciation when monetary policy is tightened, hence triggering stronger output effects. We quantify empirically the net impact of financial globalisation on monetary policy effectiveness through these two opposing channels. We find that since the 1990s the second channel has dominated so that financial globalisation has amplified monetary policy effectiveness in the typical advanced and emerging market economy. By our estimates, the output effect of a tightening in monetary policy has increased by 25% due to financial globalisation.

In this paper we employ a Global VAR (GVAR) model to analyse the systemic risk spillovers across the Euro area and to assess their role in the transmission of monetary policy. The results indicate a strong interconnectedness among core countries and also that peripheral economies have a disproportionate importance in spreading systemic risk. A systemic risk shock results in economic slowdown domestically and causes negative spillovers to the rest of the EMU economies. To examine how monetary policy impacts systemic risk, we incorporate high-frequency monetary surprises into the model.

Households may therefore switch between consuming home and market services in response to changes in the real wage--the opportunity cost of working at home--and changes in the price of market services. In order to analyze and quantify the implications of this trade-off for monetary policy, I embed a household sector into an otherwise standard sticky price DSGE model, which I calibrate to the U.S. economy. The results of the model are twofold. At the sectoral level, household production augments the service sector's New Keynesian Phillips curve with a sizable extra component that co-moves negatively with the output gap term, lowering the incentive of service sector firms to change their prices. This mechanism endogenously amplifies the real effects of a monetary shock in that sector, unlike in the nondurable goods sector for which households cannot manufacture substitutes at home. At the aggregate level, household production also implies more sluggish prices and a stronger response of real macroeconomic variables to a monetary shock.

Empirical evidence indicates that an accommodative monetary shock aﬀects positively and signiﬁcantly White workers, while the eﬀect on African-American workers is more uncertain and not signiﬁcant for the Hispanic workers. These results are robust when considering unconventional monetary policy measures in the speciﬁcation and when exploring the impact of monetary policy on diﬀerent genders and age groups. Finally, we highlight that these results are mainly driven by a “recession eﬀect”, whereby as a result of occupational, segregation minorities do not beneﬁt from the Federal Reserve’s accommodative monetary policy during recessions. Our ﬁndings suggest that monetary policy is ineﬀective in reducing the unemployment gap among minorities in the US, and that the Fed should speciﬁcally target the African-American unemployment rate in its reaction function.

The key channel for disposable income is the savings redistribution channel, whereby households with high debt-to-income ratios gain relatively more from a lower interest rate. Because of the high home ownership rate in Norway, most households gain from higher house prices, but the middle and lower part of the distribution gain relatively more as they are more indebted.

The VAR model reveals that the contributions of transition rates in explaining unemployment differ across shocks. After a technology shock, unemployment fluctuations are mainly explained by the job finding process, while the contributions of the two margins are more balanced for the monetary shock. The theoretical model is not able to reproduce the underlying mechanisms inducing unemployment. In particular, the conditional contributions of the job separation margin are overestimated each time. For instance, after a technology shock, 60% of unemployment changes are generated by this margin, while the data suggest a contribution of 28%.

Specifically, we show that, although a more accommodative monetary policy increases employment of black households more than white households, the overall effects are small. At the same time, an accommodative monetary policy shock exacerbates the wealth difference between black and white households, because black households own less financial assets that appreciate in value. Over multi-year time horizons, the employment effects are substantially smaller than the countervailing portfolio effects.

The increasing need for capital funds in Bangladesh is largely met by banks, mainly due to the country’s underdeveloped nature of the stock market. Bank ﬁnancing is assumed to be inﬂuenced by monetary policies, particularly, by bank rates adopted each year by the central bank of Bangladesh. On the other hand, while some studies stress the need for strengthening the debt and equity securities markets to support Bangladesh’s fast economic growth, debates swirl about whether or to what extent the stock market contributes to economic growth in the country. To address the understanding gap, in this paper, we examine the impact of capital ﬁnancing through equity initial public oﬀerings (IPO) and bank rate on the economic growth of Bangladesh. We use annual data from 1981 to 2019 and employ an autoregressive distributive lag (ARDL) framework to examine the long-run and short-run impacts of IPO ﬁnancing and bank rate on GDP growth rate. Our ﬁndings suggest the existence of a long-run cointegrating relationship between IPO ﬁnancing, bank rate, and GDP growth. We ﬁnd that IPO ﬁnancing does not have a signiﬁcant long-run impact but shows only a one-period short-run positive impact on economic growth. On the other hand, bank rate shows a long-run negative and a one-period short-run positive impact on economic growth. Findings overall suggest that IPO ﬁnancing does not signiﬁcantly contribute to long-run economic growth while giving only a temporary boost. Further, increases in bank rate - as one would expect - depress economic growth in the long-run, while generating herd behavior immediately. Our ﬁndings stress the need for encouraging more quality IPO issuances, increasing the issuance size, and ensuring proper utilization of the funds by IPO issuers to make the capital market a key driver of economic growth.",,2023-03-16 15:36:21,2023-03-16 15:36:21,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,en,,,,,Zotero,,,,,https://jfmg.bicm.ac.bd/bicmApi/storage/pdf/8YznZzumtweS9p37zYLgUcH0bT8IKL5mviKGdkSf.pdf,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,7229,1,111,1974

Several key coefficients in the model--such as the slopes of the Phillips and IS curves, the sensitivities of domestic inflation and output to ""global"" output, and so forth--are allowed in the estimation to depend on the extent of globalization (modeled as the changing degree of openness to trade of the economy), and, therefore, they become time-varying. The empirical results indicate that globalization can explain only a small part of the reduction in the slope of the Phillips curve. The sensitivity of U.S. inflation to global measures of output may have increased over the sample, but it remains very small. The changes in the IS curve caused by globalization are similarly modest. Globalization does not seem to have led to an attenuation in the effects of monetary policy shocks.

However, the impact of expansionary monetary policy on the unemployment rate above the NAIRU is hampered by the exchange rate depreciation and high unit labour costs above the trend growth.

Drawing from Post-Keynesian and structuralist theories of inflation, this paper uses a vector autoregression with a Post-Keynesian identification strategy to show that the decline in the inflation rate and inflation volatility was due primarily to (1) wage declines and (2) falling import prices caused by international competition and exchange rate effects. The paper uses a graphical analysis, impulse response functions, and variance decompositions to support the argument that the decline in inflation has in fact been a ""wage and import price moderation,"" brought about by declining union membership and international competition. Exchange rate effects have lowered inflation through cheaper import and oil prices, and have indirectly affected wages through strong dollar policy, which has lowered manufacturing wages due to increased competition. A ""Taylor rule"" differential variable was also used to test the ""good policy"" hypothesis.

Each chapter looks at a different component of the macroeconomy. In the first chapter I study how empirically observed consumption behavior influences monetary policy transmission into output and prices. I show that extensive margin changes in employment status lead households to consume disproportionately more flexible price goods. In contrast to that, after intensive margin changes of permanent income households consume more sticky prices goods. In a multi-sector New Keynesian model with labor market frictions, non-homothetic preferences and home-production I argue that monetary policy--even if solely interested in price stability--should take into account developments in the labor market and optimally follows a dual mandate in inflation and employment stabilization. In the second chapter I study labor market responses to monetary policy shocks using individual-level microdata. In particular I distinguish between intensive margin responses of hourly wages and hours worked and extensive margin responses of changes in the labor market status. I find that expansionary monetary policy shocks have little effects on hourly wages and hours worked and thus do not influence the intensive margin. However, they have significant extensive margin effects through increasing employment and labor force participation. In the third chapter I empirically investigate how monetary policy during the financial crisis affected firm investment and firm financial outcomes.

US monetary policy generates sizable output spillovers to the rest of the world, which are larger than the domestic effects in the US for many economies. The magnitude of spillovers depends on the receiving country's trade and financial integration, de jure financial openness, exchange rate regime, financial market development, labour market rigidities, industry structure, and participation in global value chains. The role of these country characteristics for the spillovers often differs across advanced and non-advanced economies and also involves non-linearities. Furthermore, economies that experience larger spillovers from conventional US monetary policy also displayed larger downward revisions of their growth forecasts in spring 2013 when the Federal Reserve upset markets by discussing tapering off quantitative easing. The results of this paper suggest that policymakers could mitigate their economies' vulnerability to US monetary policy by fostering trade integration as well as domestic financial market development, increasing the flexibility of exchange rates, and reducing frictions in labour markets. Other policies - such as inhibiting financial integration, industrialisation and participation in global value chains--might mitigate spillovers from US monetary policy, but are likely to reduce long-run growth.",2016-10,2023-02-13 13:34:55,2023-02-13 13:34:55,,41-61,,Query date: 2023-02-07 15:13:56,67,,Journal of International Money and Finance,,,,,,,,,,,eoh,Availability Note: Information provided in collaboration with the RePEc Project: http://repec.org,EBSCOhost,,,,,,Foreign Exchange F31; Monetary Policy E52; Central Banks and Their Policies E58; Empirical Studies of Trade F14; Contracts and Reputation; Networks L14; Transactional Relationships,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1027,1,111,2014

Such distortions appear in the data as persistent hump-shaped responses in unemployment and output levels. The standard New Keynesian model has failed to generate such persistence, even with the inclusion of frictions like staggered wage contracts and habit formation. Adding a simple labor market matching model with heterogenous response by the households and the firms overcomes these shortcomings. We show that adverse monetary policy shocks to curb inflationary pressures increase the reservation opportunity cost of not working, by increasing the debt servicing burden of households. These same shocks reduce product demand, causing the reservation productivity a firm is willing to accept from new hires to increase. Thus labor supply increases as a result of adverse monetary shocks while labor demand falls or remains unchanged, thereby widening the cyclical variations between job destruction and job creation. This gap between desired and actual employment and output levels is suggested as a cause of observed unemployment persistence.",2012-02,2023-02-13 13:34:16,2023-02-13 13:34:16,,,,,,,,,,,,,University at Buffalo,,,,,eoh,,EBSCOhost,,,,,,Intergenerational Income Distribution; Unemployment; Wages; Employment; Aggregate Human Capital; Aggregate Labor Productivity E24; Business Fluctuations; Cycles E32; Monetary Policy E52; Time Allocation and Labor Supply J22; Labor Contracts J41,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,54,1,221,2015

A structural VAR approach is used with non-recursive contemporaneous restrictions. Several interesting results appear in the analysis. First, consistent with the predictions of a stochastic rational expectations model, a domestic monetary contraction generates a transitory fall in output and monetary aggregates. Second, there is no evidence of price and exchange rate puzzles. Third, the source of Chilean output, price level, and real exchange rate volatility is similar to that identified in industrial countries: monetary policy explains a relatively small proportion of output, price level, and exchange rate variability. Finally, foreign monetary policy innovations have very short-lived effects on domestic interest rates and have no major influence over other Chilean macroeconomic variables; while risk premium shocks influence significatively both the interest rate and the exchange rate. ____________________ I am grateful to Natalie Baumer, Rómulo Chumacero, Christian Johnson, Paulina Nazal, Nouriel Roubini, Klaus Schmidt-Hebbel, Raimundo Soto, and Andrés Velasco for their helpful comments and suggestions.

We uncover the following facts: (i) Expansionary monetary policy boosts employment and hiring growth in small firms more than in large firms; however, a monetary contraction shrinks small firms' employment and hiring growth less than in large firms. As a result, monetary policy has a countervailing effect on the employment concentration in large firms. (ii) There is an asymmetry in the effects of monetary contractions versus expansions with respect to firms' employment and hiring growth. Not accounting for such asymmetry leads to the fallacious conclusion that small firms respond more than large firms to monetary policy shocks. This asymmetry also reveals that contractionary monetary policy shocks have immediate effects on the labor market while the effects of expansionary shocks are slower to manifest. (iii) The response of employment is weaker than that of hiring, highlighting the importance of using labor market flows. (iv) The growth of earnings of new hires decreases similarly across large and small firms in contractions but reacts more for small firms in expansions. We use a heterogeneous firms model with a working capital constraint, an upward-sloping marginal cost curve, and a financial accelerator effect. We augment this model with the wage effect summarized in fact (iv) and demonstrate how the additional wage effect can explain the differential response of the hiring and employment growth of small and large firms of fact (i).",2021-10-07,2023-03-16 15:39:28,2023-03-16 15:39:28,1678273879.0,,,,,,,Heterogeneous labor market response to monetary policy,,,,,,,en,,,,,Social Science Research Network,,"Place: Rochester, NY",,,,monetary policy; Heterogeneous firms; financing constraints; labour market,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,7952,1,222,2028

We propose a multi-quantile version of the Generalized Method of Moments using the Laplace-type estimator. The empirical findings support the canonical NKPC with larger coefficients for marginal cost and expected inflation in the upper quantiles of the inflation distribution, while the hybrid NKPC fits better with the mid and lower quantiles. Accordingly, the risk of high inflation, measured by the right side tail of the conditional density, is more responsive to a change in expected inflation compared with the center and the left side. These results imply that monetary policy affects the future path of inflation in an asymmetric way, such that a tightening of monetary policy reduces high-inflation risks more than what we expect based on the point path, whereas the effect of expansionary policy on downside risk is minor. We also perform structural break tests and find that the model is unstable through 1983.

Our focus is on commodity price shocks which impact both directly through the aggregate price level, as well as through monetary policy related aggregates such as short-term interest rates. We first contrast the response of the real economy to commodity price shocks in two periods: 1983Q2-2015Q2 and 1994Q1-2015Q2, where the beginning of the second sample coincides with a statistically identified structural break, as well as the introduction of NAFTA. The results indicate that the commodity price shocks, such as for oil and metal, have a bigger impact on the real economy after NAFTA came into force, with metal prices having a larger quantitative impact on output in comparison to oil prices. Next, we investigate whether these changes have different implications for the impact of domestic monetary shocks in the three countries. We find that while the post-NAFTA period is characterized by a stronger domestic monetary policy response to commodity price shocks, the response to monetary shocks per se varies in the two time periods. In particular U.S. monetary policy, as reflected in shocks to short-term interest rates, has a weaker influence in the post-NAFTA period. Overall, the influence of global, commodity price shocks in the region relative to domestic monetary shocks is greater in the post-NAFTA period.",2019-05,2023-02-13 13:35:41,2023-02-13 13:35:41,,553-569,,,80,,Energy Economics,,,,,,,,,,,eoh,,EBSCOhost,,,,,,Monetary Policy E52; Fiscal and Monetary Policy in Development O23; Commodity Markets Q02; International Trade Organizations F13; Trade Policy; Development Planning and Policy: Trade Policy; Factor Movement; Foreign Exchange Policy O24; International Linkages to Development; Role of International Organizations O19; Energy; Economic Development: Agriculture; Environment; Natural Resources; Other Primary Products O13,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2134,1,111,2047

In addition, output and labor productivity both rise after an expansionary policy shock as in an estimated structural vector autoregression model.

Second, industrial production and the nominal interest rate are incorporated in a multivariate VAR to investigate the effects of policy shocks on the exchange rate. This helps to illustrate the possible gains and costs of the present exchange-rate regime in these CEECs and to draw some conclusions on the likely economic outcomes of adopting a firmly fixed exchange-rate regime like ERM II. Three main conclusions emerge: (1) contrary to Dibooglu and Kutan (2001), results testify to a high degree of flexibility in the CPI; (2) in contrast to the Czech Republic and Hungary, nominal shocks have a strong effect on the REER in Poland and, more specifically, there is evidence that the fluctuations in the nominal exchange rate explain a large part of REER fluctuations in this latter country; (3) in Poland, the policy mix seems more credible than in the other two countries.

According to the dilemma hypothesis, global financial cycles determine domestic financial conditions regardless of an economy's exchange rate regime and monetary policy autonomy is possible only if capital mobility is restricted. We find that global financial cycles indeed reduce domestic monetary policy effectiveness in more financially integrated economies. However, we also find that another salient feature of financial globalisation has the opposite effect and amplifies monetary policy effectiveness. Economies increasingly net long in foreign currency experience larger valuation effects on their external balance sheets in response to exchange rate movements triggered by monetary policy impluses. Overall, we find that the net effect of financial globalisation since the 1990s has been to amplify monetary policy effectiveness in the typical advanced and emerging market economy. Specifically, our results suggest that the output effect of a tightening in monetary policy has been stronger by 40% due to financial globalisation. Insofar as valuation effects can only play out if an economy's exchange rate is flexible, the choice of the exchange rate regime remains critical for monetary policy autonomy under capital mobility and in the presence of global financial cycles.

The model is constructed to incorporate the standard three-equation New Keynesian model as a special case. We refer to the parameterizations where demand shocks have expansionary effects regardless of the degree of price stickiness as Real Keynesian parameterizations. We use the model to show how the effects of monetary policy--for the same degree of price stickiness--differ depending whether the model parameters are within the Real Keynesian subset or not. In particular, we show that in the Real Keynesian subset, the effect of a monetary policy that tries to counter demand shocks creates the opposite tradeoff between inflation and output variability than under more traditional parameterizations. Moreover, we show that under the Real Keynesian parameterization neo-Fisherian effects emerge even though the equilibrium remains unique. We then estimate our extended sticky price model on U.S. data to see whether estimated parameters tend to fall within the Real Keynesian subset or whether they are more in line with the parameterization generally assumed in the New Keynesian literature. In passage, we use the model to justify a new SVAR procedure that offers a simple presentation of the data features which help identify the key parameters of the model. The main finding from our multiple estimations, and many robustness checks is that the data point to model parameters that fall within the Real Keynesian subset as opposed to a New Keynesian subset.

First, which set of policies is more effective in affecting the sources of economic growth and promoting growth? Second, does the interaction between relative competence of policies and policy competence have implications on economic growth. The work reveals that in this group of countries there does not seem to be a prevailing rule as to which set of policies is more important in determining economic growth.

China's two specific banking regulations, in the form of loan-to-deposit ratio (LDR) and loan quota, only applies to the traditional banks. Our estimates show that regulation shocks have been the major driver of China's rising shadow banking during 2009-2016. Shadow banking leads to a higher amount of credit in the economy by helping escape constraints from traditional intermediaries, however financial frictions in the shadow banking sector create a ""dual financial acceleration"" mechanism. We show how the presence of shadow banking negatively affects the transmission of monetary policy and the effectiveness of macroprudential policy. We also demonstrate that deleveraging policy, that has been implemented in China tightening shadow banking in the spirit of the ""look-through"", may have a contractionary impact on the economy. Efficient policy frontier analysis suggests that coordinating monetary policy and leverage ratio regulation would have helped stabilize the economy while reduce the share of shadow banking.",2019-10,2023-02-13 13:36:06,2023-02-13 13:36:06,,,,Query date: 2023-02-09 16:59:31,57,,Pacific-Basin Finance Journal,,,,,,,,,,,eoh,,EBSCOhost,,,,,,"Monetary Policy E52; Financial Markets and the Macroeconomy E44; Fiscal and Monetary Policy in Development O23; Banks; Depository Institutions; Micro Finance Institutions; Mortgages G21; Corporate Finance and Governance O16; Economic Development: Financial Markets; Saving and Capital Investment; Inflation P24; Money; Socialist Systems and Transitional Economies: National Income, Product, and Expenditure; Socialist Institutions and Their Transitions: Financial Economics P34",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2714,1,222,2107

Impulse Response Function showing a shock in OPT by one standard deviation has a negative effect on economic growth (for short-, medium, and longterms) through out. In other words, if OPT increases, economic growth decreases. An increase in Reserve Requirement (RR) has an immediate negative impact on growth. In a slightly longer period, the impact of RR on growth becomes positive. However, in other periods (medium- and long-terms) the impact of RR on growth was negative. The increased rDiskonto can increase growth in the medium term, contrary to other periods.",2014-09-30,2023-03-16 15:36:05,2023-03-16 15:36:05,1677456000.0,203-210,,9,6,,J. Econ. Int.

The report develops a critique of financial programming and inflation targeting, presents a series of empirical estimates on the impact of monetary policy variables in Ghana, and describes the elements of an alternative monetary policy. In addition, the report documents the institutional and structural constraints currently operating in the financial system which prevent the sector from facilitating investment, growth, and improved employment opportunities.

Empirically, in response to a negative productivity shock, unemployment increases substantially when financial intermediary leverage is high, but not in other episodes. The model relies primarily on the stochastic discount factor (SDF) channel. Negative productivity shocks increase the financial intermediary leverage. Because the financial intermediary sector can't raise enough funds in high leverage states, the SDF increases sharply. Meanwhile, the matching surplus is low. The negative relationship between the SDF and the matching surplus decreases the present value of future matching surpluses. Consequently, vacancy posting and employment plummet in a high leverage state. The model implies that the unemployment rate would have been 2 percentage points lower if the 2008 recession had started with the early 2001 financial intermediary leverage. Chapter 2: Financial Intermediary Leverage and Monetary Policy Transmission: The effects of monetary policy strongly depend on the leverage of the primary dealers. Monetary policy is more effective when the primary dealers have a higher share of equity in their total assets. When the equity-to-asset ratio is one percentage point above average, the effect of a monetary policy shock on the S&P 500 return is 1.44 percentage points larger. In a VAR exercise, shocks to the leverage of the primary dealers account for thirty percent of the forecast error variances of real GDP, investment, and consumption in the U.S. The leverage of the primary dealers is counter-cyclical, and thus helps explain why monetary policy is more powerful during expansions as found in the literature. Chapter 3: Asset Pricing with Heterogeneous Beliefs and Preferences under Portfolio Constraints: I study the interaction between portfolio constraints and incentives to trade. I construct a general equilibrium model in continuous time so the equilibrium conditions can be explicitly characterized. The model has two agents disagreeing about the growth rate of the dividend of a real asset. The agents also have different risk aversion parameters. Each agent faces a short sale constraint and a borrowing constraint. Furthermore, the borrowing constraint depends on the market value of the real asset. I characterize conditions under which each constraint is binding. The short sale constraint, when binding, decreases the equity premium and the market price of risk of the real asset. The borrowing constraint, when binding, increases the equity premium and the market price of risk of the real asset. The long-run probability density of the model states features two modes concentrating on either end of the state space, so both agents have positive wealth in the long run.",2020-08,2023-02-13 13:34:24,2023-02-13 13:34:24,,,,,,,,,,,,,University of Wisconsin,,,,,eoh,,EBSCOhost,,,,,,Intergenerational Income Distribution; Unemployment; Wages; Employment; Aggregate Human Capital; Aggregate Labor Productivity E24; Macroeconomics: Production E23; Capacity E22; Capital; Intangible Capital; Investment; Macroeconomics: Consumption; Saving; Wealth E21; Financial Markets and the Macroeconomy E44; Banks; Depository Institutions; Micro Finance Institutions; Mortgages G21,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,265,1,222,2135

Second, expected equity market volatility (VIX) is found to be more important than bond market volatility (MOVE). Pre-crisis, a shock to the VIX leads to a concomitant rise in the MOVE, a contraction of economic activity, a fall in broker-dealer leverage and a rise in the term premium, consistent with pro-cyclical swings in market liquidity. Post-crisis, an innovation to the VIX is instead associated with a drop in the term premium, suggesting the prevalence of flight to quality effects.",2017-01-01,2023-03-16 15:32:44,2023-03-16 15:32:44,1677092105.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,en,,,,,Social Science Research Network,,"Place: Rochester, NY",,,,bond market volatility; long-term interest rate; quantitative easing; term premia; unconventional monetary policy; VIX,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,6350,1,112,2137

This decline is not simply a passive byproduct of reduced volatility in common factors or shocks. Instead, structural changes occurred in the long-run and dynamic relationships among industries' sales and inventory investment behavior--especially in the automobile and related industries, which are linked by supply and distribution chains featuring new production and inventory management techniques. Using a HAVAR model (Fratantoni and Schuh 2003) with only two sectors, manufacturing and trade, we discover structural changes that reduced comovement of sales and inventory investment both within and between industries. As a result, the response of aggregate output to all types of shocks is dampened. Structural changes accounted for more than 80 percent of the reduction in output volatility, thus weakening the case for ""good luck,"" and altered industries' responses to federal funds rate shocks, thus suggesting the case for ""better monetary policy"" is complicated by changes in the real side of the economy.",2005,2023-02-13 13:37:31,2023-02-13 13:37:31,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,eoh,Availability Note: Information provided in collaboration with the RePEc Project: http://repec.org,EBSCOhost,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,4622,1,112,2138

We find that nonfinancial credit is a vulnerability: impulses to the credit-to-GDP gap when it is high leads to a recession. Risk appetite leads to an economic expansion in the near-term, but also higher credit and a recession in later years, suggesting an intertemporal tradeoff. Monetary policy is generally ineffective at slowing the economy once the credit-to-GDP gap is high, suggesting important benefits from avoiding excessive credit growth.

The empirical results show that the nominal interest rate reacts not only to inflation and output gap, but also to the changes in RMB exchange rate. Moreover, the indeterminacy in the macro-dynamics indicates the instability in China's monetary policy, and it stems from two sources, the sunspot shock and the indeterminate propagation of fundamental shocks.

This paper estimates a medium-scale DSGE model with a deflation steady state for the Japanese economy during the period from 1999 to 2013, when the Bank of Japan conducted a zero interest rate policy and the inflation rate was almost always negative. Although the model exhibits equilibrium indeterminacy around the deflation steady state, a set of specific equilibria is selected by Bayesian methods. According to the estimated model, positive shocks to households' preferences and wage markup, and a negative shock to monetary policy do not necessarily have an inflationary effect, in contrast to a standard model with a targeted-inflation steady state. An economy in the deflation equilibrium could experience unexpected volatility because of sunspot fluctuations, but it turns out that sunspot shocks have a limited effect on Japan's output fluctuations and rather contribute to stabilizing the economy after the global financial crisis.",2020-07,2023-02-13 13:35:06,2023-02-13 13:35:06,,1151-1185,,5,24,,Macroeconomic Dynamics,,,,,,,,,,,eoh,,EBSCOhost,,,,,,"Inflation; Business Fluctuations; Cycles E32; Deflation E31; Interest Rates: Determination, Term Structure, and Effects E43; Monetary Policy E52; Price Level; General Aggregative Models: Neoclassical E13; Central Banks and Their Policies E58",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1266,1,221,2144

We describe how these features produce a global system of Phillips curves explicitly connected by multilateral trade relationships. In equilibrium, disturbances abroad propagate to domestic variables not only directly, through pairwise trade between countries, but also indirectly through third-country effects arising from the network structure of trade. The combined propagation mechanisms imply that country-specific shocks alone explain almost 90 percent of the observed average pairwise comovement in output growth between countries. These idiosyncratic shocks also explain more than 1/2 the cross-country comovement in inflation, and between output and inflation. We estimate that a European inflationary shock results in significant U.S. inflation accompanied by lower output, and that these responses transpire almost entirely from the network effects of trade. In addition, a tightening of U.S. monetary policy generates a percentage decline in output globally that is comparable to 1/2 the domestic response.",2022,2023-02-13 13:35:45,2023-02-13 13:35:45,,43-43,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,eoh,Availability Note: Information provided in collaboration with the RePEc Project: http://repec.org,EBSCOhost,,,,,,Inflation; Business Fluctuations; Cycles E32; Deflation E31; Price Level; Open Economy Macroeconomics F41; International Business Cycles F44,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2241,1,222,2145

To do so, we construct indices of monetary policy surprises for the three major communication channels of the CBC: the release of policy meetings' statements, minutes, and monetary policy reports (IPoM). We assess monetary policy predictability and efficacy by looking at the size and time-evolution of monetary policy surprises associated with meeting statements and the impact of the above communication channels on asset markets. We find that, in general, the CBC's has been effective in its forward guidance through its statements and IPoM. Policy actions are quite predictable, especially post the global financial crisis. The response of equity prices and the exchange rate to monetary policy surprises have the right sign but are not robust. We also find an asymmetric response of equity prices to minutes suggesting that market participants extract information on the status of the economy especially when minutes have a loosening effect. Finally, to look at the macroeconomic impact we find that a 100 bps monetary policy tightening shock implies a decline in economic activity (IMACEC) of about 2 pp. after one year, while the response of inflation is more muted.",2018,2023-02-13 13:34:53,2023-02-13 13:34:53,,33-33,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,eoh,Availability Note: Information provided in collaboration with the RePEc Project: http://repec.org,EBSCOhost,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,973,1,221,2146
