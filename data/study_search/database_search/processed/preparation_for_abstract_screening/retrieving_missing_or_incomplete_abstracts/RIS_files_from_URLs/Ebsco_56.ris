Consequently, there has been extensive theoretical and political debate about the proper adjustment to these external shocks, and whether monetary policy should be accommodating in the event of rising energy prices.

TI  - Monetary Policy Shocks in Open Economies and the Inflation Unemployment Trade-Off: The Case of the Euro Area
AU  - Ribba, Antonio
T2  - Journal of Risk and Financial Management
AB  - In this paper, we show that in order to obtain a sound identification of Euro Area monetary policy shocks, one needs to deal with the interaction of the European Central Bank and the US Federal Reserve. In other words, a proper identification of monetary policy shocks for an open economy like the Euro Area requires consideration of the US policy rate. Indeed, when we exclude the Federal Funds Rate from an estimated VAR model including a set of Euro Area variables, i.e., Eonia, inflation and unemployment, we detect a wrong sign in the response of inflation to contractionary monetary policy shocks. Moreover, even adding the world price of oil does not help to overcome the problem. Instead, for a sample covering the period 1999–2019, when the Federal Funds Rate and the Euro–Dollar exchange rate are added to the VAR model inflation shows statistically non-significant effects for two years and thereafter decreases. Under this specification of the model, a clear and significant unemployment inflation trade-off emerges. These conclusions are confirmed by using industrial production instead of the unemployment rate in the VAR model.

AB  - In this chapter, we provide some empirical evidence on whether the effects of monetary policy shocks on real output growth in the Euro-area depend upon the phase of the business cycle that the economy was undergoing (the so-called state asymmetries). To do so, we follow a two-step procedure: (i) first, we derive short-term interest rate shocks from a Taylor rule, which accounts for a nonlinearity in the interest-rate setting behaviour of the central bank, and (ii) next, we apply a multivariate version of Hamilton Econometrica, vol. 57, pp. 357–384 (1989)'s Markov Switching methodology to allow for different effects of interest-rate shocks on real output growth in periods of high and low growth. Our findings provide some support for the presence of this type of asymmetries, whereby interest rate shocks have larger effects in recessions than in expansions.

AB  - This paper examines whether monetary policy has similar effects across regions in the United States. Impulse response functions from an estimated structural vector autoregression reveal a core of regions-New England, Mideast, Plains, Southeast, and the Far West-that respond to monetary policy changes in ways that closely approximate the U.S. average response. Of the three noncore regions, one (Great Lakes) is noticeably more sensitive to monetary policy changes, and two (Southwest and Rocky Mountains) are found to be much less sensitive. A state-level version of the model is estimated and used to provide evidence on the channels for monetary policy.

AU  - Muhammed, Abdullahi Bashir

T2  - Labuan Bulletin of International Business and Finance (LBIBF)
AB  - As a result of the West African region's continuous political and economic instability, various economies have used monetary policy changes to respond to shocks from macroeconomic causes. Scholars disagree on the mechanisms of monetary policy, external shocks, and macroeconomic activity links in an economy, according to the available literature in both inter-regional and intra-regional evaluations. This article promotes understanding and management of external shocks in monetary policy by focusing on two key goals. (1) To investigate external shocks, macroeconomic performance, and the dynamics of monetary policy in Western African countries. (2) Use the S-VAR method of estimate to investigate the impact of these economic indices on monetary policy dynamics in Nigeria, Ghana, Cameroon, and Niger. The S-VAR method was chosen because it is useful for analysing macroeconomic shocks and monetary policy transmission. The findings reveal that the West African countries are so interconnected, any change in the price of non-oil commodities would have a significant impact on the exchange rate, which will be channelled through policy rates to GDP. We recommend and emphasise the need of diversifying member countries' productive and export bases rather than continuing to rely on one or a few items as the primary source of income.

AB  - The paper compares theoretical impulse response functions from a DSGE model for a small open economy with an empirical VAR model estimated for the Croatian economy. The paper analyses the impact of productivity shock on the following variables: output gap, interest rate, CPI inflation and terms of trade. Impulse responses from the empirical VAR model do not resemble those from the theoretical model for in any proposed monetary regimes. Results of modelling simultaneous interrelationships between variables support conclusion that productivity shocks do not play a significant role in determining the variation of selected macroeconomic variables in the case of Croatia.

AU  - Defina, Robert H.

T2  - Applied Economics
AB  - Large swings in the price of oil which have occurred during tha past two decades have substantially affected US inflation, unemployment and economic growth. In the light of those experiences, a debate has arisen over how monetay policy should respond. This study contributes to that debate by evaluating empirically the economy's performance under three realistic monetary policy response rules. By doing so, it advances what has largely been a theoretical discussion. The policy rules studied – money growth targets, nominal GDP growth targets and interest rate targets – are evaluated by estimating how closely the resulting economic outcomes approximate an ‘optimal’ outcome. The optimal outcome arises when the Fed follows a well-defined optimal response rule. Of the three strategies, a nominal GDP target is found to be mose desirable, while an interest rate target is least desirable.

AU  - Zdzienicka und Kolerus, Aleksandra, Christina
AB  - Growth in the West African Economic and Monetary Union (WAEMU) has been negatively affected 
by macroeconomic shocks. Such shocks can be symmetric, affecting similarly all countries of the Union 
simultaneously, or asymmetric, affecting only some of the countries in the WAEMU. A symmetric shock 
can, in principle, be addressed by a common monetary policy or a coordinated fiscal policy response. 
For asymmetric shocks, a national fiscal policy response, supported by structural reforms, remains the 
main available instrument. An additional constraint in the WAEMU for dealing with shocks is that 
the exchange rate of the common currency, the CFA franc, is pegged to the euro, which limits the scope 
for active monetary policy. Therefore, whether or not business cycles are synchronized in the WAEMU 
and how this synchronization has evolved over time represent important question for policymakers. The 
analysis presented in this chapter suggests asymmetric shocks prevail in the region and their smoothing 
is limited. Therefore, coordinated fiscal policy has an important role to play in addressing both sym-
metric  and  asymmetric  shocks.  Further  integration  and  strengthening  of  market- based  smoothing 
mechanisms (for example, developing and improving access to the financial system) would also likely 
reduce the occurrence and economic impact of asymmetric shocks.

AU  - Gros, Daniel
T2  - National Institute Economic Review
AB  - The external shocks emphasised by the standard Optimum Currency Area approach (i.e. shocks to exports) have surprisingly little influence on employment and unemployment in most member countries of the European Union (EU) whether or not exchange rates are fixed. Short-run exchange-rate variability (but not the level of the exchange rate) seems to have a negative impact on employment.It is often claimed that a high degree of international labour mobility is a condition for a monetary union. However, what matters for the Optimum Currency Area approach is the difference between inter-regional and inter-national labour mobil ity and not the level of the latter. Recent data show that international labour mobility in Europe is of the same order of magnitude as inter-regional labour mobility within member countries and that, the latter seems to be influenced by the housing market. EMU is thus unlikely to significantly worsen the problems that arise through the low mobility of labour in Europe.

AB  - This paper looks at how macroeconomic volatility is transmitted to the labor market. It estimates employment, unemployment, and wage Okun coefficients and uses them to show that, compared with industrial countries, Latin American countries adjust to shocks more through wages than through employment. It shows that inflation plays some role in explaining the difference between em-ployment elasticity in Latin America and industrial countries but that there is a difference between the two regions that cannot be explained away by differences in inflation. When focusing on Latin America, the paper finds that within Latin America, inflation increases labor market flexibility in countries that have highly regulated labor markets and that enforce regulations.

AU  - Mitrakos, Theodore
AU  - Zonzilos, Nicholas
AB  - The paper analyses the dynamic response of inflation to various economic shocks and investigates the sources of inflation persistence through a set of counter factual simulations. Analysis shows that inflation seems to be more persistent in Greece than, on average, in Euro Area. Inflation persistence tends to be higher in response to fiscal shocks than others shocks. Only an indirect tax shock could be classified as “non-persistent” for Greece. Inflation persistence is crucially affected by the degree of competition in product market and it is mainly of intrinsic nature while nominal rigidities and frictions in the labor market do not seem important in explaining the relatively higher persistence of Greek inflation.

AB  - Monetary policy design has experienced major changes over the last twenty years. These changes had their origin in changes in macroeconomic theory, a better understanding of the importance of achieving and maintaining low inflation, and the abandonment of fixed pegs in favor of floating exchange rate regimes. The new macroeconomic models emphasize the role of microeconomic foundations and expectations and highlight the need to develop and strengthen institutions. One of the key consequences of this process is the recognition that stabilization policies cannot achieve permanent gains in output or employment.

AB  - Open economies, particularly emerging markets and commodityintensive economies, deal with large external shocks. These are typically of a financial nature in the case of the former and real—in that they affect the terms of trade—in the case of the latter. Alternative policy reactions and policy setups may dampen or amplify the consequences of these shocks, affecting the magnitude of the shock. It is therefore very important to analyze and evaluate alternative policy setups and policy reactions from different angles in order to draw lessons for the macroeconomic management of open economies.

AB  - This paper examines the recent evolution of monetary policy since the adoption of formal inflation targeting in Brazil. We argue that the new policy framework has been subject to a severe test in its first years of existence, represented by external shocks - oil prices, and increased international financial volatility. Moreover, we examine some selected issues that deserve due consideration given their importance to the conduct of monetary policy. The first issue is the presence of a substantial portion of prices with backward-looking adjustment, a fact that affects monetary policy reaction since it reduces the efficiency of domestic interest rates in controlling inflation. The second addresses the question of how inflation targets should be monitored in a country that has an ongoing economic program with the International Monetary Fund. This last issue is particularly important when considering the effects of shortening monitoring horizons on the variability of inflation and output.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>

AB  - Inflation targeting has recently been adopted by the central banks of several advanced economies, including Australia, Canada, Finland, New Zealand, Spain, Sweden, and the United Kingdom. The policy is widely perceived as having been successful (see the discussions in Leiderman and Svensson, 1995, McCallum, 1996, Bernanke and others, 1999), and it is now increasingly being implemented by emerging economies.

AB  - This paper reviews the main features of the Czech macroeconomic development in the last years with the accent on disinflation and real GDP. The adjustment path of the Czech economy is clear: The decrease in nominal GDP growth has caused a deceleration of inflation on the one side and a drop of growth rates of real GDP and later even a decline in the level of real GDP on the other side. Further the econometric investigation of relations between wages and labour productivity and net inflation, producer prices and gap has been made. As the main factors influencing the disinflation in the last quarters the index of raw materials and foodstuffs has been revealed. The analysis of the impact of real exchange rate on net exports concludes the paper.

AB  - This paper examines the response of the prime rate–deposit rate spread to shocks in real output growth, inflation, and the stance of monetary policy. A simple model of the lending and deposit markets is introduced that provides insight as to how these macroeconomic factors might affect the spread. The paper employs the recently developed technique of generalized impulse response analysis proposed. This method does not impose a priori restrictions as to the relative importance each of the variables in the underlying vector autoregression may play in the transmission process. Thus, the results provide robust evidence as to the relationship between the prime rate-deposit rate spread and these macroeconomic factors. Specifically, the model suggests and the empirical results confirm that shocks to inflation widen the spread while unexpected changes in the federal funds rate and real output growth lead to a narrower spread.

AB  - This essay discusses rules for monetary policy in open economies. If policymakers seek to stabilize output and inflation, optimal rules in open economies differ considerably from optimal rules in closed economies. In open economies, stability is best achieved by targeting long-run inflation' a measure of inflation adjusted to remove transitory effects of exchange-rate movements. Stability is also enhanced by adding an exchange-rate term to "Taylor rules" for setting interest rates. Finally, central banks must choose whether their policy instrument is an interest rate or a "monetary conditions index": an average of the interest rate and the exchange rate. The nature of shocks to the exchange rate determines which of these choices keeps output and inflation more stable.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>

AB  - We develop two variants of an open economy general equilibrium model employing Blanchard-Yaari life overlapping generations, which are shown to capture a number of important aspects of the UK economic cycle. We analyse the equilibrium stochastic processes of the model�s endogenous variables in response to two primitive driving processes: total factor productivity and various measures of total factor productivity corrected for capacity utilisation over the cycle. We find, following Vickers� (2000) suggestion, that the marginal product of capital is procyclical. Interestingly, we find that the difference between the procyclical real rate from the artificial economies and the observed real rate seems to play a role in explaining the UK inflation and output outcomes.

AB  - The loss of the exchange rate as an independent policy instrument implied by EMU has spurred calls for an insurance scheme as a buffer against temporary, asymmetric shocks to national income. We study the potential properties of such a system using historical data from the 12 EC economies. An insurance scheme with reasonable properties can be implemented on the basis of a fairly complex econometric formula. However, simplifying the computation of the transfers severely worsens the performance of the system. Forcing the system to balance financially is not a critical constraint. The simulations show that stabilizing asymmetric shocks around a common trend may amplify the univariate variance of GDP for some member countries. Next, we evaluate an insurance mechanism based on unemployment insurance. Such a scheme would provide a reasonable degree of stabilization of asymmetric shocks. However, it raises an additional trade-off between stabilization efficiency and interpersonal equity.

The key fea-ture of the model is that financial shocks drive a wedge between the required return on capital and the safe rate of return on household savings. A widening of this wedge causes a decline in investment spending and a worsening in the quality of borrowers' balance sheets, factors that lead to a mutually-reinforcing deterioration in financial conditions. We employ the methodology developed by Gilchrist and Zakrajšek [2011b] to construct a measure of distress in the financial sector, which is used to simulate the model. Our simulations indicate that an intensification of financial stresses implies a sharp widening of credit spreads, a significant slowdown in economic activity, a decline in short-term interest rates, and a persistent disinflation. Moreover, such financial market disruptions account for the bulk of contraction in U.S. economic activity that occurred during the last three recessions; these disturbances also generate the investment booms that characterized the 1995–2000 and 2003–06 periods.

This clear and balanced book brings together economists and political scientists to explain why the creation of a European monetary union is so contentious; how the debate has affected the political determination to construct a monetary union; and how it will influence the functioning of EMU into the next century. Focusing on how economics and politics interact both in the prelude to unification and in its aftermath, the authors provide an innovative analysis of a spectrum of related issues: how EMU relates to Europe's unemployment crisis, how it will affect the process of economic adjustment, what convergence means for the performance of the member states separately, and how the member states will decide both whether to participate themselves and whom else to admit to the monetary club.

TI  - Local government and economic shock within a federal system: the Australian case: Andrew Beer
AU  - BEER, ANDREW
T2  - The Recession and Beyond
AB  - Introduction
Local governments are a small but critical component within the Australian 
federal system of government, and they played an important role in the broader 
governmental response to the financial crises that emerged across the developed 
world from the second half of 2007. The role played by local governments in 
Australia focused on both planning for the potential impacts of economic downturn, and serving as an efficient conduit for stimulus spending by the Australian 
government. The ways in which Australian local governments responded to the 
economic downturn reflected the broader position of the Australian economy in 
the decade leading to the onset of economic turmoil, the long-term standing of 
local government relative to the other two tiers of government, and the nature of 
the Australian government’s response – under then Prime Minister Kevin Rudd 
– to this economic challenge. This chapter begins by establishing the background 
conditions that shaped the part played by local governments in responding to the 
threat of recession. It starts with an examination of local government within the 
Australian federal system, before moving on to sketch out economic conditions 
in Australia over the period 2005 to 2010 and the influence those macroeconomic settings have had on the actions of government. The chapter then outlines the Australian government’s response to foreshadowed economic crisis and 
its articulation with local government, before moving on to consider the national 
programmes directed to local governments and their implementation. Finally, the 
chapter considers the broader implications for the nature of Australian federalism and the role of local government over the coming decades. It considers the 
future delivery of economic stimulus measures and the ways in which public 
programmes can and should be delivered.

AB  - In recent years there has been an increasing research effort in estimating regional asymmetric shocks and assessing their importance within the European Monetary Union (EMU). In this chapter we offer an evaluation of the different approaches by distinguishing them according to methodological underpinnings, variables used and pitfalls and potential extensions of the analysis. The structure of this contribution is the following. In section 2 we discuss the relative importance of asymmetric shocks and the main problems connected with their measurement. In section 3 we focus on the explanatory variables which are assumed to determine the asymmetric reaction to shocks and distinguish between sectoral and regional effects. In section 4 we review some of the models that have explicitly measured regional effects within a multivariate econometric context. In section 5 we evaluate the potential offered by alternative frameworks in dealing with the relative shortcomings of the different approaches. Final comments are left to section 6.

AU  - Gordon, Robert J.
T2  - Cambridge Books
AB  - The seventeen seminal essays by Robert J. Gordon collected here, including three previously unpublished works, offer sharply etched views on the principal topics of macroeconomics - growth, inflation, and unemployment. The author re-examines their salient points in a uniquely creative, accessible introduction that serves on its own as an introduction to modern macroeconomics. Each of the four parts into which the essays are grouped also offers a new introduction. The papers in Part I explore different key aspects of the history, theory, and measurement of productivity growth. The essays in Part II investigate the sources of business cycles and productivity fluctuations. Those in Part III cover the effects of supply shocks in macroeconomics. The final group presents empirical studies of the dynamics of inflation in the United States. The foreword by Nobel Laureate Robert M. Solow comments on the abiding importance of these essays drawn from 1968 to the present.

TI  - Public sector adjustment to external shocks and domestic pressures in Brazil, 1970-85
AU  - Werneck, Rogério L. L.
T2  - Textos para discussão
AB  - There is a widespread view that very often the behaviour of the public sector in Brasil, as in 
other Latin American countries facing similar external economic problems, has been detrimental to 
the adjustment effort that was required from the economy, amplifying therefore the difficulties to be 
faced, and contributing to make harder the role to be played by the private sector in the adjustment. 
The purpose of the paper is to examine the behaviour of the public sector along the various external 
adjustment processes of the Brazilian economy since the early seventies, and to analyse to what extent 
the mentioned widespread view is really true in the case of Brazil.

Dabei wird die Reaktion der Geldbehörden auf Angebotsschocks und zyklische Nachfrageschwankungen in einem Modell dargestellt. Die Hauptergebnisse sind, daß das Ausmaß, in dem Angebotsschocks aufgefangen wurden, von Land zu Land erheblich variiert hat und daß ein großer Teil der verstärkten Streuung der Inflationsraten in den siebziger Jahren mit ziemlicher Sicherheit diesem Verhalten zugeschrieben werden kann.

AU  - Bae, Sang-Kun
AU  - Ratti, Ronald A.
AB  - Distortions introduced by targeting nominal income growth, or an exchange rate peg, in the trade-off between inflation and output in the stabilization of shocks to supply and terms of trade cannot be eliminated simultaneously. If supply shocks are optimally stabilized, targeting an exchange rate peg yields relatively less bias in shocks to the terms of trade if the economy is relatively open. Optimal degree of conservativeness depends on shock selected for stabilization and on policy regime. Targeting a weighted sum of change in real exchange rate and nominal income growth is shown to replicate the optimal equilibrium without resort to a state-contingent rule.

TI  - The Inflationary Process in Israel: Shocks and Accommodation
AU  - Bruno, Michael
AU  - Fischer, Stanley
AB  - The rate of inflation in Israel increased from 8 percent in 1965 to 300-400 percent in the first half of 1984. The inflationary process until 1977 was not qualitatively different from that in the OECD countries, but after the financial liberalization of 1977 the economy appeared to move into a new era in which the inflation rate seemed capable only of rising. Our explanation of the inflationary process is that because of institutional adaptations, and as a result of accommodating monetary and fiscal policies, the stabilizing forces in the economy are so weak that the inflation rate is in a meta-stable equilibrium. We ascribe the apparent asymmetry of the inflation to the expansionary underlying thrust of monetary and fiscal policy. We develop an analytical framework that assigns roles to indexation, to the financial structure, and to the exchange rate system in determining the dynamics of the economy. We place very little blame for the inflation on wage indexation, which has been incomplete, but we regard the extensive indexation of the returns on financial assets, and the steady shift out of nominal assets, as major contributing factors, for the economy is now left with virtually no nominal anchor. The paper concludes with a brief discussion of alternative stabilization plans, arguing that a successful stabilization program will have to be comprehensive and rapid.

TI  - On Modeling the Effects of Inflation Shocks
AU  - Fair, Ray C.
AB  - A popular model in the literature postulates an interest rate rule, a NAIRU price equation, and an aggregate demand equation in which aggregate demand depends on the real interest rate. In this model a positive inflation shock with the nominal interest rate held constant is explosive because it increases aggregate demand (because the real interest rate is lower), which increases inflation through the price equation, which further increases aggregate demand, and so on. In order for the model to be stable, the nominal interest rate must rise more than inflation, which means that the coefficient on inflation in the interest rate rule must be greater than one.

AU  - Brooks, Robin

T2  - Intereconomics
AB  - The eurozone was marked by economic divergence in the decade before the COVID-19 shock, something that was a starting point for our Campaign against Nonsense Output Gaps (CANOO), which we unveiled in Brooks and Fortun (2019a) over a year ago. In the years leading up to the pandemic, countries in the euro core had recovered quickly from the global financial crisis in 2008/9, while the periphery suffered stagnant and intermittent growth, leaving GDP in some cases well below pre-crisis levels. One reason for this divergence can be found in financial conditions, which tightened substantially for countries like Italy and Spain during the sovereign debt crisis in 2011/12. That tightening in financial conditions made a uniform recovery across the eurozone difficult and some echoes of this can be found in financial markets today. Concerted ECB action has prevented real yields on the euro periphery from rising materially, but it is still the case that real Italian bond yields exceed those in the euro core. As a result, the potential for continued economic divergence within the eurozone exists, which may also exacerbate deflation risk for the region overall.

TI  - Policy responses to shocks and monetary effectiveness under inflation targeting: The Philippine case
AU  - Debuque-Gonzales, Margarita
T2  - Philippine Review of Economics
AB  - This article examines how monetary policy responses to economic shocks and monetary policy effectiveness have changed in the Philippines since inflation targeting was implemented in 2002. The study makes use of a structural vector autoregression to estimate financial and monetary policy shocks, among other shocks, based on an identification strategy similar to Gilchrist and Zakrajsek [2012] and Bassetto et al. [2016]. A Philippine financial conditions index (FCI) purged of monetary influences then decomposed according to instrument or market is used to aid estimation and analysis. Results of the recursive vector autoregressions (VAR) comparing pre-inflation-targeting and inflation-targeting periods reveal stronger and more systematic policy responses to non-financial demand shocks, partial and transitory accommodation of supply shocks, and greater exchange rate flexibility initially under the new monetary policy regime. There is, however, an observed weakening of monetary policy responses to financial disturbances and monetary policy transmission to growth likely related to episodes of strong capital inflows. JEL classification: C32, E31, E42, E44, E52, E58

AB  - This article presents evidence on the relationship between price and financial stability. We construct an annual index of financial conditions for the United States, 1790–1997, and estimate the effect of aggregate price shocks on the index using a dynamic ordered probit model. We find that price-level shocks contributed to financial instability during 1790–1933 and that inflation rate shocks contributed to financial instability during 1980–97. The size of the aggregate price shock needed to alter financial conditions depends on the institutional environment, but we conclude that a monetary policy focused on price stability would contribute to financial stability.

AB  - This chapter examines whether the source or the type of inflow of the capital inflow to emerging economies makes any difference to the consequences of the capital flow. Our results, based on a sample of 53 emerging markets over 1980–2013, show that when it comes to the source of the inflow, the macroeconomic and financial-stability consequences of flows driven by residents (asset flows) and nonresidents (liability flows) are broadly similar in economic terms. Formal statistical tests, however, suggest that liability flows are more prone to causing economic overheating and domestic credit expansion than asset flows. On the types of inflows, we find that compared to direct investment, portfolio debt and other investment flows are associated with larger macroeconomic imbalances and financial vulnerabilities. We conclude that policy should try to mitigate the untoward consequences of inflows, and shift their composition from risky to safer forms of liabilities.

T2  - Monetary Policy in the Context of the Financial Crisis: New Challenges and Lessons
T3  - International Symposia in Economic Theory and Econometrics
AB  - This chapter analyzes the exchange rate pass-through (ERPT) into different prices for 12 euro area (EA) countries. We provide new up-to-date estimates of ERPT by paying attention to either the time-series properties of data and variables endogeneity. Using VECM framework, we examine the pass-through at different stages along the distribution chain, that is, import prices, producer prices, and consumer prices. When carrying out impulse response functions analysis, we find a higher pass-through to import prices with a complete pass-through (after one year) detected for roughly half of EA countries. These estimates are relatively large compared to single-equation literature. We denote that the magnitude of the pass-through of exchange rate shocks declines along the distribution chain of pricing, with the modest effect recorded for consumer prices. When assessing for the determinant of cross-country differences in the ERPT, we find that inflation level, inflation volatility, and exchange rate persistence are the main macroeconomic factors influencing the pass-through almost along the pricing chain. Thereafter, we have tested for the decline of the response of consumer prices across EA countries. According to multivariate time-series Chow test, the stability of ERPT coefficients was rejected, and the impulse responses of consumer prices over 1990–2010 provide an evidence of general decline in rates of pass-through in most of the EA countries. Finally, using the historical decompositions, our results reveal that external factors, that is, exchange rate and import prices shocks, have had important inflationary impacts on inflation since 1999 compared to the pre-EMU period.

TI  - The Macroeconomic Impact on Hong Kong of Hypothetical Mainland Shocks
AU  - He, Dong
AU  - Shu, Chang
AU  - Yip, Raymond
AU  - Cheng, Wendy
AB  - As the Hong Kong economy became increasingly integrated with that of Mainland China, it has benefited tremendously from the strong performance of the Mainland economy. At the same time, skilful macroeconomic management and sustained structural reforms on the Mainland have engendered a virtuous cycle, which reduces risks to Hong Kong from any potential adverse developments on the Mainland. Nevertheless, questions have been raised how Hong Kong will fare in the unlikely event that the Mainland is hit by economic shocks, which could cause the economy to deviate from its envisaged robust medium-term growth path. Shocks could be transmitted from the Mainland to Hong Kong through two main channels. First, Hong Kong¡¦s exports and imports are likely to be affected by sharp fluctuations in Mainland macroeconomic variables. Reduced export earnings and changes in terms of trade will then spill over to the Hong Kong domestic economy. Second, monetary and financial conditions in Hong Kong may be altered by changes in investor confidence and in fund flows as a result of Mainland shocks. The resulting change in Hong Kong dollar interest rates will impact asset prices and domestic demand. We use an econometric model to quantify the impact on Hong Kong of a range of Mainland macroeconomic shocks. Seven hypothetical scenarios are considered: external shocks include a large renminbi revaluation, a significant US economic slowdown, a trade war, and an oil price hike; domestic shocks include an investment retrenchment, a credit crunch, and financial instability. The magnitudes of the shocks are deliberately set to be large¡Xtypically taken as two standard deviations of the shock variable based on historical observations over a ten year period. Our simulation analysis suggests that Hong Kong is resilient against the shocks

AU  - Driffill, E. J.
T2  - European Economic Review
AB  - In exchange rate-overshooting models, of the kind recently used by Buiter and Miller to analyse the cost of reducing inflation, an unexpected change in monetary policy typically induces jumps in the exchange rate and (maybe) prices. This note illustrates with a numerical example a money-stock policy which reduces inflation instantly and permanently to zero without a jump in exchange rates or prices. This policy is optimal if the objective function contains no time-discounting and depends on the level of output and the squared inflation rate. It is also optimal if only inflation enters the objective function.

TI  - The Response of Wages and Labor Supply Movements to Employment Shocks Across Europe and the United States
AU  - Thomas, Alun H.
AB  - This paper assesses the responsiveness of wages and labor force movements to employment shocks across British and U.S regions and across Europe using a multivariate vector autoregression technique. The paper finds inflexible real wages in all three areas in that each area`s real wage responds very little to employment shocks. However, the response of the labor force to employment shocks is much greater in the United States compared to Europe. The strong labor force response in the United States prevents any persistence in relative regional unemployment rates whereas the lack of mobility in Europe results in persistent unemployment rate differentials across British regions and European nations. Europe must therefore adopt measures to reduce barriers to immobility if it is to succeed in moderating the persistence in relative unemployment rates.

TI  - Italian Unemployment 1975-95: An Analysis of Macroeconomic Shocks and Policies Using Evidence from a Structural Vector Autoregression
AU  - Christofides, Charalambos
AB  - This paper examines the determinants of Italian unemployment by estimating and utilizing a structural vector autoregressive (VAR) model. Both long-run and short-run macroeconomic determinants of unemployment are examined; the latter are analyzed in much greater detail than is customary in the literature. The relative contribution of long-run and short-run causes is quantified and the different time horizons over which they operate are identified. Policies affecting labor market performance are described and their effect estimated whenever data permit; policy implications are also drawn whenever possible. The most recent labor market reforms together with the atypical effects of the most recent recession are examined, and forecasts of unemployment are produced. A number of scenarios are also constructed to highlight the effect of alternative labor market arrangements.

TI  - External Shocks and Inflation in Developing Countries Under a Real Exchange Rate Rule
AU  - Montiel, Peter J.
AU  - Ostry, Jonathan D.
AB  - This paper shows that the response of inflation to external shocks is very different when the authorities target the real exchange rate than when they follow a fixed exchange rate or a preannounced crawling peg. Specifically, shocks that would have no effect on the steady-state inflation rate under a fixed exchange rate are either inflationary or deflationary under a real exchange rate rule. Moreover, irrespective of the degree of capital mobility, the authorities will find it difficult to mitigate the destabilizing effects of real shocks on the price level by using monetary policy, except possibly in the very short run.

TI  - How Do the Skilled and the Unskilled Respond to Regional Shocks? The Case of Spain
AU  - Mauro, Paolo

T2  - IMF Staff Papers
AB  - Are there any differences in how workers of different skill levels respond to regional shocks? This paper addresses that question using the methodology of Blanchard and Katz (1992) and a unique data set on working-age population, labor force, and employment for five educational groups (ranging from the illiterate to the college-educated) over 1964-92 for the 50 Spanish provinces. The paper finds that the highly skilled migrate very promptly in response to a decline in regional labor demand, while low-skilled workers drop out of the labor force or stay unemployed.

TI  - The Perils of Tax Smoothing: Sustainable Fiscal Policy with Random Shocks to Permanent Output
AU  - Tanner, Evan
AU  - Carey, Kevin
AB  - If permanent output is uncertain, tax smoothing can be perilous: both debt levels and tax rates are difficult to stabilize and may drift upwards. One practical remedy would be to target the debt. However, our simulations confirm that such a policy would require undesirably volatile fiscal adjustments and may inhibit countercyclical borrowing. An alternative would be to link the primary surplus not only to the debt ratio (like tax smoothing) but also to its volatility, thus preempting further adjustments while gradually reducing the debt.
