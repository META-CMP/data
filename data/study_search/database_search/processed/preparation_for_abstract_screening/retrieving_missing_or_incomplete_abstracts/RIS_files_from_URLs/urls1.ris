TI  - Changing Effects of Monetary Policy on Real Economic Activity
AU  - Friedman, Benjamin M.
AB  - Major changes have taken place in the U.S. economy within the past quarter century. Changes with implications that are at least potentially important for the effect of monetary policy on real economic activity include the elimination of Regulation Q interest ceilings and the development of the secondary mortgage market, the greater openness of the U.S. economy including both goods markets and financial markets, and the rapidly increasing indebtedness of private borrowers including especially nonfinancial business corporations. Examination of relationships between monetary policy and economic activity at a detailed, disaggregated level indicates several changes within the past quarter century that are broadly consistent with these changes in the underlying economic environment: First, the elimination of major episodes of credit rationing in the mortgage market has clearly rendered housing less sensitive to restrictive monetary policy; moreover, there is no solid evidence of change in the sensitivity of homebuilding to mortgage interest rates. Second, business fixed investment has become more sensitive to financial market conditions, at least in the short run. Third, consumer spending has become less sensitive to interest rate increases and stock price declines, at least in situations that persist for lengthy periods of time. Fourth, although foreign trade has clearly grown relative to aggregate U.S. economic activity, both exports and imports exhibit less sensitivity to exchange rate changes, and hence presumably less sensitivity to monetary policy actions, than in earlier years.

T2  - NIPE Working Papers
AB  - This paper provides time-series and panel evidence on the monetary policy transmission for five key emerging market economies: Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa (BRICS). The analysis is based on a Bayesian vector auto-regression (VAR) model that includes seven key variables. Instead of the conventional Choleski decomposition as used in the literature, Bayesian methodology has been used to identify the monetary policy (positive interest rate) shock along with using the more recent sign restrictions approach. Finally, to summarise the response for this group of key emerging market economies, we carry out a panel VAR exercise, which provides further robustness of our finding that contractionary monetary policy has a negative effect on output. These results are robust to changes in the specification, the methodology and sub-sample time horizon.

AB  - The Oxford Handbook of Banking, Second Edition provides an overview and analysis of developments and research in banking written by leading researchers in the field. This handbook will appeal to graduate students of economics, banking and finance, academics, practitioners, regulators, and policy makers. Consequently, the book strikes a balance between abstract theory, empirical analysis, and practitioner, and policy-related material. The Handbook is split into five parts. Part I, The Theory of Banking, examines the role of banks in the wider financial system, why banks exist, how they function, and their corporate governance and risk management practices. Part II deals with Bank Operations and Performance. A range of issues are covered including bank performance, financial innovation, and technological change. Aspects relating to small business, consumer, and mortgage lending are analysed together with securitization, shadow banking, and payment systems. Part III entitled Regulatory and Policy Perspectives discusses central banking, monetary policy transmission, market discipline, and prudential regulation and supervision. Part IV of the book covers various Macroeconomic Perspectives in Banking. This part includes a discussion of systemic risk and banking and sovereign crises, the role of the state in finance and development as well as how banks influence real economic activity. The final Part V examinesInternational Differences in Banking Structures and Environments. This part of the Handbook examines banking systems in the United States, European Union, Japan, Africa, Transition countries, and the developing nations of Asia and Latin America.

TI  - Does Monetary Policy Affect Real Economic Activity?: Why Do We Still Ask This Question?
AU  - Friedman, Benjamin M.
AB  - The predominant weight of the existing evidence suggests that the effects of monetary policy on real economic activity are systematic, significant, and sizeable. Yet questions remain, both about individual empirical results and, more broadly, about the different methodological approaches that researchers have used to investigate these effects. This paper addresses the conceptual issues that account for our continuing to ask whether monetary policy has real effects even though, at a certain level, we do 'know' the answer. The paper's overview of theory and evidence suggests that much of the explanation for the continuing tug-of- war between research findings and subsequent questions in this area lies in two sets of limitations, one reflecting how economics conceptualizes behavioral processes and one reflecting how economics draws inferences from observed data.

TI  - Can Monetary Policy Affect Economic Activity under Surplus Liquidity? Some Evidence from Macedonia.
AU  - Jovanovic, Branimir
AU  - Krstevska, Aneta
AU  - Popovska-Kamnar, Neda
AB  - Surplus liquidity in the banking system changes the monetary transmission mechanism, reducing the effectiveness of the traditional instrument, the interest rate. In this paper we examine the real effects of several monetary-policy instruments in Macedonia, an economy characterized by surplus liquidity. We use regime-switching Vector Autoregressions and track the responses of different economic activity indicators to changes in the monetary policy instruments. Our findings suggest that the interest rate channel is weakly effective in Macedonia. The responses to the other instruments are not very sizeable, either, but are significant. This implies that monetary policy can affect economic activity through the reserve requirement and the offered amount of central bank bills. These findings have implications for both the analysis and the conduct of monetary policy in economies with surplus liquidity. Regarding analysis, the implication is that the traditional approach, which considers only the role of the interest rate, is likely to lead to wrong conclusions. Regarding conduct, the implication is that monetary authorities, besides on the price impact of the interest rate, should additionally rely on the reserve requirement and other available instruments producing volume impact.

AU  - Stiglitz, Joseph E.
AB  - When government expenditures exceed current tax revenues, the resulting deficit must be financed either by issuing bonds, which imply obligations to levy future taxes, or by creating high-powered money. The choice between money and bonds is often thought to be of great moment for both real and nominal variables; that is, monetary policy matters.There is by now a wide empirical consensus that monetary policy has effects on real variables like output and employment. But there is far less agreement about why this is so. The purpose of this paper is to take issue with some currently fashionable views of why money has real effects,and to suggest a new theory, or rather resurrect an old one–the loanable funds theory–and give it new, improved microfoundations.

TI  - Monetary policy surprises, central bank information shocks, and economic activity in a small open economy
AU  - Laséen, Stefan
AB  - In this paper I study the effects of monetary policy on economic activity and asset prices in Sweden, separately identifying the effects of a conventional policy change from effects of new information about economic fundamentals. Recent research has shown that high-frequency changes in policy interest rate futures prices around central bank policy announcements might not only contain monetary policy shocks but also central bank information shocks. I add to this line of research by studying a case where the central bank, in contrast to many other central banks studied in this literature, is very open and transparent about the monetary policy decision and publishes a full set of forecasts including the interest rate at the same moment as the decision is revealed. I use this information to construct an informationally-robust instrument for monetary policy shocks as the component of high-frequency market surprises triggered by policy announcements that is orthogonal to both central bank's economic projections, including policy rate projections, and to past market surprises. I also add sign restrictions on stock market changes around the announcement to separate structural monetary policy shock from central bank information shocks. In contrast to recent work for other countries, I do not find that separating monetary policy shocks from central bank information shocks is important to measure the effects of monetary policy in Sweden.

AU  - Zampolli, Fabrizio
AB  - Based on empirical VAR models, we investigate the role of (option-implied) stock and bond market volatilities and monetary policy in the determination of the US 10-year term premium. Our preliminary findings are that an unexpected loosening of monetary policy - through a cut in the federal funds rate in the pre-crisis sample or an increase in bond purchases post-Lehman - typically leads to a decline in both expected stock and bond market volatilities and the term premium. However, while conventional monetary policy boosts economic activity in the precrisis period, bond purchases are found to have no statistically significant real effects postcrisis. Second, expected equity market volatility (VIX) is found to be more important than bond market volatility (MOVE). Pre-crisis, a shock to the VIX leads to a concomitant rise in the MOVE, a contraction of economic activity, a fall in broker-dealer leverage and a rise in the term premium, consistent with pro-cyclical swings in market liquidity. Post-crisis, an innovation to the VIX is instead associated with a drop in the term premium, suggesting the prevalence of flight to quality effects.

T2  - African Review of Money Finance and Banking
AB  - This study examined empirically the relative impact of fiscal and monetary policy influences on economic activity in five African countries employing a modified St. Louis-type reduced-form equation for the period 1965 to 1990. The regression results suggest that the monetary influence is relatively stronger than the fiscal influence in three of the countries, Ghana, Kenya and Nigeria, while the fiscal influence was appreciably significant in only one country, Nigeria. In two countries, Sierra Leone and Tanzania, neither the fiscal nor the monetary influences was significant in determining nominal income. The results, in effect, suggest that monetary policy can be pursued more successfully as a stabilization policy tool in Ghana, kenya and Nigeria. Additional analysis, however, needs be done before these results are useful for policy purposes and further conclusions can be reached on the remaining countries, Sierra Leone and Tanzania.

AB  - The unfolding subprime crisis and the challenges facing central banks in using monetary policy to resolve the possible credit crunch, highlight the importance of understanding the relationship between monetary policy and risk-based capital requirements. We explore the implications of risk-based capital requirements, à la Basel, for the conduct of monetary policy. A “bank balance-sheet channel” of monetary policy is identified, which operates through bank capital and influences the bank's loan decision. Using a dynamic banking model, we endogenize the capital decision and show that banks are likely to hold capital above the regulatory minimum to avoid being constrained. We derive the option value of holding capital, and show how this value is affected by monetary policy, level of economic activity, structure of the banking industry, and by changes in the level of regulatory capital.

AB  - In this article, we seek to accomplish three objectives. First, we discuss the basic mechanisms at work in these liquidity effect models. Second, we investigate one way of generating persistent (as opposed to purely transitory) liquidity effects. We argue that once a simplified version of the model in Christiano and Eichenbaum (1992a) is modified to allow for small costs of adjusting sectoral flows of funds, positive money supply shocks generate long lasting, significant liquidity effects as well as persistent increases in aggregate economic activity. Finally, we discuss some of the policy implications of this class of models.

T2  - Economic Bulletin Articles
AB  - This article explains how negative rates are transmitted via banks and financial markets, both via standard transmission channels and via channels specific to negative interest rates. The latter can enhance the stimulus, but may also hinder it, in particular in the case of protracted periods of negative rates. Euro area bank profitability has been persistently low since the financial crisis, and this has the potential to impair bank lending. At the same time, profits have increased since 2014 and the impact of negative interest rates is assessed as broadly neutral so far, as the negative contribution to net interest income has been offset by the positive impact on borrower creditworthiness. Finally, the article reports empirical evidence – drawn from a range of studies – on how negative rates affect the broader economy, starting with bank portfolio allocation decisions, lending volumes and lending rates. The article then elaborates on the impact of the negative rate policy on key macroeconomic aggregates, notably economic activity and inflation. JEL Classification: E42, E52, G21

AU  - Kashyap, Anil K.

AU  - Wilcox, David W.
AB  - In this paper we use the relative movements in bank loans and commercial paper to provide evidence on the existence of a loan supply channel of monetary policy transmission. A first necessary condition for monetary policy to work through a lending channel is that banks must view loans and securities as imperfect substitutes, so that monetary tightening does affect the availability of bank loans. We find that tighter monetary policy leads to a shift in firms' mix of external financing – commercial paper issuance rises while bank loans fall, suggesting that loan supply has indeed been reduced. Furthermore, these shifts in the financing mix seem to affect investment (even controlling for interest rates). This implies that bank and non-bank sources of finance are also not perfect substitutes for businesses. We also argue that this view of the transmission mechanism can help explain why interest rate spreads involving commercial paper rates have had considerable predictive power for many measures of economic activity.

The influence of each factor has varied, however, within this common theme. In the past 22 years at least two specific changes have occurred: the October 1979 shift to greater emphasis on a narrow measure of money and a shift in the early 1980s from M1 targeting to M2. ; The author models monetary policy econometrically, testing the influence of numerous factors on monetary policy and investigating whether a formal model can capture variations in these factors and in the policy instrument. The study also tests the influence of a number of other factors that are often thought to have an impact on monetary policy, such as measufes Of fiscal policy, exchange rates, and stock prices, as well as the President and Fed Chairman and the political party in power. The results indicate that monetary policy does not react systematically to these other factors.

This study analyses quarterly German data from 1976 to 2009 in a threshold SVAR, expanding the SVAR approach by Blanchard and Perotti (2002). In a linear benchmark SVAR, the analysis finds that hiking spending yields a short-term fiscal multiplier of around 0.70, while the fiscal multiplier resulting from an increase in taxes and social security contributions is -0.66. In addition, the threshold model derives fundamentally new insights on the effects of shocks, depending on when in the business cycle they occur, their size and their direction. Most importantly, fiscal spending multipliers are much larger in times of a negative output gap but have only a very limited effect in times of a positive output gap. Discretionary revenue policies, on the other hand, have a generally more limited impact. Our findings have important implications for the optimal fiscal policy mix over different stages of the business cycle. Various robustness checks, including a different threshold specification, do not influence these implications substantially.

AU  - Kilinc, Mustafa

T2  - Working Papers
AB  - This paper tries to identify the monetary policy shocks in Turkey during the explicit inflation targeting period starting from 2006 using a structural VAR approach. We model Turkey as a small open economy where domestic variables are affected by external factors like commodity prices and global demand but domestic variables do not affect external variables. We analyze the effects of four shocks on Turkish economy: two domestic shocks of interest rates and risk premium, and two external shocks of commodity prices and global demand. All shocks are found to have significant effects on main economic variables. Positive interest rate shocks appreciate the domestic currency and decrease the inflation whereas positive risk premium shocks cause a depreciation and an increase in inflation. Both of these shocks also cause a decrease in the domestic activity. Being an open and internationally integrated economy, Turkey is significantly affected by global shocks. A positive global demand innovation leads to an increase in global commodity prices, which together increase both the level of prices and economic activity in Turkey. Positive commodity price shocks also increase the inflation in Turkey.

AB  - This study investigates the implications of noisy information regarding the measurement of economic activity for the evaluation of monetary policy. Using a simple model of the U.S. economy, I show that failing to account for the actual level of information noise in the historical data provides a seriously distorted picture of feasible macroeconomic outcomes and produces inefficient policy rules. Naive adoption of policies identified as efficient when this difficulty is ignored results in macroeconomic performance worse than actual experience. When the noise content of the data is properly taken into account, policy reactions are cautious and less sensitive to the apparent imbalances in the unfiltered data. The resulting policy prescriptions reflect the recognition that excessively activist policy can increase rather than decrease economic instability.

AB  - This paper examines the dynamic interactions among the equity market, economic activity, inflation, and monetary policy under three monetary policy regimes using bivariate and multivariate vector autoregressive cointegrating specifications. The bivariate results for the real stock returns-inflation pair weakly support a negative correlation in the 1970s and 1980s. While the bivariate findings suggest a weak, negative relationship between real returns and the federal funds in the 1970s and 1980s, the multivariate findings strongly support short-term linkages in the 1970s. There appears to be no consistent dynamic relationship between monetary policy and stock prices in that the relationship differs across monetary regimes.

AB  - A synthesis of new and old approaches in understanding macroeconomic fluctuations and the role of monetary policy (MP) is the credit surface, where the interest rate is a function of multiple credit terms: leverage, credit rating, term, etc. We gauge credit conditions using the credit surface in mortgage, corporate bond, and peer-to-peer lending markets, and explore its relationship with economic activity in these segments of the economy. In addition, we study the transmission of MP through the corporate bond credit surface. Our results suggest that the passthrough of MP is heterogeneous and non-monotonic in ex-ante riskiness, initially declining as risk increases but then increasing. Our preliminary results support the view that the credit surface is important for macroeconomic fluctuations and the transmission of MP.

AB  - We study the relationship between the strength of the bank credit channel (BCC) of monetary policy and real GDP growth in the United States using quarterly commercial bank level data between 1986 and 2008. We find that the BCC was significantly stronger during periods of low economic growth. Monetary policy is more effective through this channel in spurring economic activity during periods of low growth, rather than in cooling the economy when growth is high. Furthermore, we find that the BCC operated through a broader range of loan categories and banks than previously documented, underscoring this channel?s economic relevance.

AB  - Recent explanations of the transmission mechanism of monetary policy have emphasized that riskier, lower net worth borrowers are more dependent on bank lending than larger, less risky borrowers. Evidence from the Federal Reserve's Survey on Terms of Bank Lending indicates that the proportion of relatively high quality new loans (%Safe) moves countercyclically and Granger causes GDP and inventory investment. In the aftermath of a tightening of monetary policy, the %Safe variable increases, and in turn, policy tends to relax once %Safe has risen.

AB  - Using a stock-flow-fund ecological macroeconomic model, we analyse (i) the effects of climate change on financial stability and (ii) the financial and global warming implications of a green quantitative easing (QE) programme. Emphasis is placed on the impact of climate change damages on the price of financial assets and the financial position of firms and banks. The model is estimated and calibrated using global data and simulations are conducted for the period 2016–2120. Four key results arise. First, by destroying the capital of firms and reducing their profitability, climate change is likely to gradually deteriorate the liquidity of firms, leading to a higher rate of default that could harm both the financial and the non-financial corporate sector. Second, climate change damages can lead to a portfolio reallocation that can cause a gradual decline in the price of corporate bonds. Third, climate-induced financial instability might adversely affect credit expansion, exacerbating the negative impact of climate change on economic activity. Fourth, the implementation of a green corporate QE programme can reduce climate-induced financial instability and restrict global warming. The effectiveness of this programme depends positively on the responsiveness of green investment to changes in bond yields.

AB  - Among the topics that monetary economists discuss, few have been debated as much or as long as the meaning of a given change or rate of change in the stock of money or the interest rate. Some have stressed the importance of monetary or of interest rate changes as a guide to the future pace of economic activity. Yet it seems reasonable to conclude that the partisans have not succeeded in convincing others that one or the other of these variables is the most reliable measure of the effect of monetary policy. There is not even agreement that the choice is restricted to these two measures. Bank credit, free reserves, liquid assets, and other variables are mentioned frequently. Since it is not unusual to find that quite different—even opposite—conclusions are suggested by the various measures, a comparison of the information provided by some of the variables proposed as indicators is called for.

We look at small subsidiary banks that are affiliated with the same holding company but operate in different geographical areas. These banks face the same marginal cost of funds due to internal capital markets, but face different borrowers as they concentrate their lending with small local businesses. Exploring cross-sectional variation in local economic conditions across these subsidiaries, we investigate whether borrower creditworthiness influences the response of bank lending to monetary policy. Our results are consistent with a demand-driven transmission mechanism that works through firm balance sheets and is independent from the bank lending channel.

TI  - Estimating the Impact of Monetary Policy on Household and Corporate Loans: a FAVEC Approach
AU  - Ljubaj, Igor
AB  - The paper tests the presence of cointegration by estimating the impact of monetary policy on household
and corporate loans, while taking account of developments in the macroeconomic environment. The testing
is applied using the Johansen procedure based on a factor-augmented vector error correction model (FAVEC
model), which is augmented by the factor of the macroeconomic environment, for the period from January
2003 to December 2010. Factor analysis is used to estimate the macroeconomic environment factor, which
reflects developments in domestic economic activity based on a large number of time series. The monetary
policy indicator, which adequately represents the complexity of the CNB measures, is also defined. The paper
confirms the existence of a long-run relation between household loans, the macroeconomic environment factor and the monetary policy indicator. At the same time, no such a relation was confirmed for corporate loans.
This is probably due to the fact that, in contrast to households, enterprises raised substantial funds from other
financing sources (particularly abroad) in preceding years, and not only from commercial banks. This has limited the impact of monetary policy on corporate loans. Impulse response functions estimated on the basis of
the FAVEC model showed that a restrictive monetary policy shock leads to a decrease in household loans, while
a positive shock in the macroeconomic environment factor, which generally represents an increase in overall
economic activity, has a favourable impact on bank loans to households. The identification of the long-run
relation yields the conclusion that CNB measures were justified; without them credit growth would certainly
have been larger, which means that external imbalances in the Croatian economy would have been worse. On
the other hand, the recent crisis and the halt in bank lending coupled with the weak credit channel of monetary
policy in Croatia limited the impact of incentives for credit growth. This could in future undermine the longrun relation estimated in this paper.

T2  - Journal of Macroeconomics
AB  - This paper analyzes the monetary policy of the European Central Bank (ECB) both before and after the outbreak of the global financial crisis in 2008. In the literature, researchers typically select one Taylor rule-based model to analyze monetary policy of central banks and to derive determinants for the interest rate setting. However, uncertainty about the choice of this respective model is typically neglected. In contrast, we apply a Bayesian model averaging (BMA) approach to extend the Taylor rule to account for model uncertainty driven by heterogeneity in the ECB’s decision-making body, the Governing Council. Our results suggest the following: First, the ECB focuses on the inflation rate when setting interest rates. Second, economic activity indicators were in the focus of the ECB before the financial crisis. Third, over the last decade, the role of economic activity decreased, indicating that inflation is the main driver of monetary policy decisions in the post-crisis period. Fourth, when setting interest rates, central bankers appear to consider more than one model.

AB  - A large literature has documented statistically significant effects of monetary policy on economic activity. The central explanation for how monetary policy transmits to the real economy relies critically on nominal rigidities, which form the basis of the New Keynesian (NK) framework. This paper studies a different transmission mechanism that operates even in the absence of nominal rigidities. We show that in an OLG setting, standard open market operations (OMO) carried by central banks have important revaluation effects that alter the level and distribution of wealth and the incentives to work and save for retirement. Specifically, expansionary OMO lead households to front-load their purchases of durable goods and work and save more, thus generating a temporary boom in durables, followed by a bust. The mechanism can account for the empirical responses of key macroeconomic variables to monetary policy interventions. Moreover, the model implies that different monetary interventions (e.g., OMO versus helicopter drops) can have different qualitative effects on activity. The mechanism can thus complement the NK paradigm. We study an extension of the model incorporating labor market frictions.

AB  - Abstract
Research purpose. The purpose of this paper is to examine the efficiency of the transmission mechanism of the monetary policy in a banking system with excess liquidity. More specifically, it aims to examine how the interest rates of the central bank bills and inflation rate affect total lending and the overall economic activity in the country. For this purpose, the analysis is based on the case of the Republic of North Macedonia, whose banking system has exhibited excess liquidity in the past decade.
Design / Methodology / Approach. The paper is based on two different VECM models, analyzing the impact of the central bank bills interest rates and the inflation rate, on lending and real GDP in the Republic of North Macedonia, for the period 2000 – 2019. The analysis also encompasses unit root tests for the variables of interest in order to determine their order of integration and choose appropriate statistical methods. The short-run causality is assessed using the Granger causality test, whereas the existence of the potential long-run relationship is examined using the Johansen cointegration test. In addition, in order to determine the magnitude of the mutual relationship, variance decomposition is employed in both estimated models. Moreover, the stability

AB  - The short-run Phillips curve describes a positive short-run relationship between the level of economic activity and inflation. When the level of demand in the economy as a whole runs ahead of the level of output that the economy can supply in the short run, price pressures increase and inflation rises. This article reviews the origins of the short-run Phillips curve with particular emphasis on the long-standing idea that the shape of this curve may be non-linear, with inflation becoming more sensitive to changes in output when the cycle of economic activity is high than when it is low. This type of non-linearity in the short-run Phillips curve, which is typically motivated by the effects of capacity constraints that limit the ability of the economy to expand in the short run, has recently attracted renewed attention. The article surveys recent research that finds some evidence of this type of non-linearity in the Phillips curve in Canada and considers the potential implications for monetary policy.

AB  - We assess the effect and the timing of the corporate arm of the ECB quantitative easing (CSPP) on corporate bond issuance. Because of several contemporaneous measures, to isolate the programme effects we rely on one key eligibility feature: the euro denomination of newly issued bonds. We find that the significant increase in bonds issuance by eligible firms is due to the CSPP and that this effect took at least six months to unfold. This result holds even when comparing firms with similar ratings, thus providing evidence that unconventional monetary policy can foster a financing diversification regardless of firms’ risk profile. We also highlight the impact of the programme on the real economic activity. The evidence suggests that while all firms increased investment in capital expenditures and intangible assets, the CSPP induced eligible firms to invest in marketable and equity securities, to repurchase their own stocks, to hold cash and to carry out short-term investment.

AU  - Hendrickson, Joshua R.
T2  - Journal of Macroeconomics
T3  - Banking in Macroeconomic Theory and Policy
AB  - Over the last several years, the Federal Reserve has conducted a series of large scale asset purchases. The effectiveness of these purchases is dependent on the monetary transmission mechanism. Former Federal Reserve chairman Ben Bernanke argued that large scale asset purchases are effective because they induce portfolio reallocations that ultimately lead to changes in economic activity. Despite these claims, a large fraction of the expansion of the monetary base is held as excess reserves by commercial banks. Concurrent with the large scale asset purchases, the Federal Reserve began paying interest on reserves and enacted changes in its Payment System Risk policy. In this paper, I estimate the effect of the payment of interest on reserves (as well as other payment policy changes) on the demand for daylight overdrafts through Fedwire. Since Fedwire provides overdrafts at a fixed price, any fluctuation in the quantity of overdrafts is a change in demand. A reduction in overdrafts corresponds with an increase in the demand for reserves. I show that the payment of interest on reserves has had a negative and statistically significant effect on daylight overdrafts. Furthermore, I interpret these results in light of recent theoretical work. I argue that by paying an interest rate on excess reserves that is higher than comparable short term rates, the Federal Reserve likely hindered the portfolio reallocation channel outlined by Bernanke. Thus, the payment of interest on reserves increased payment processing efficiency, potentially at the expense of limiting the ability of monetary policy to influence economic activity.

T2  - International Journal of Finance & Economics
AB  - This paper employs a medium scale Bayesian VAR model to provide a rich picture of the transmission of unconventional monetary policy (UMP) shocks in various dimensions of the economy, and to shed light on the appropriate policy mix that the central bank could adopt to fulfil its price stability mandate. We show that UMP shocks have a significant positive impact on both economic activity and inflation; stem financial market stress episodes and boost economic sentiment. Additionally, several channels seem to have been activated, including the exchange rate, inflation expectations and the bank lending channel. Counterfactual policy analysis suggests that a policy mix that combines the use of permanently negative interest rates with a balance sheet expansion at a steady pace over a long period, could bring inflation closer to the target. Alternative policy scenarios that, either give more weight on the purchases during the first months or, terminate asset purchases too early, would fail to keep inflation on track to meet its target.

AU  - Li, Fuchun

AB  - This paper examines empirically whether ﬁnancial stress conditions play a role as a nonlinear propagator of monetary policy shocks. This propagation takes the form of a threshold vector autoregression in which a regime change occurs if ﬁnancial stress conditions cross a critical threshold. Using nonlinear analysis methods, we examine questions like: Does monetary policy have the same effect on the real economy in the low ﬁnancial stress regime and high ﬁnancial stress regime? Suppose that the economy be currently in a given ﬁnancial stress regime, does monetary policy shock have a substantial effect on the transition probability from the given regime to another. As suggested among the ﬁndings in this paper, contractionary monetary shocks typically have a larger effect than expansionary monetary shocks, and large contractionary monetary shocks have larger effects on output in the high ﬁnancial stress regime than do in low ﬁnancial stress regime. Large contractionary monetary shocks increase the likelihood of being in the high ﬁnancial stress regime.

AU  - Disyatat, Piti
AB  - This paper studies the interaction between monetary policy and macroeconomic stability in a model with two distinguishing features. First, financing - cash flows - underpins all economic activity, with banks generating deposits by granting loans. Money is non-neutral as the policy interest rate anchors the real economy. Second, bank lending is subject to an endogenous boom-bust cycle due to externalities in the loan market. Together, these features imply that monetary policy may have long-lasting impact on the real economy through its in fluence on the financial cycle. In this 'finance-based' economy, there is no well-defined natural rate of interest to which the economy gravitates. The possibility of a 'low interest rate trap' emerges: monetary policy that leans insufficiently against the build-up of financial imbalances increases the vulnerability to financial busts over successive cycles. As a result, low rates can beget lower rates.

AU  - Friedman, Benjamin M.
T2  - International Finance
AB  - The influence of monetary policy over interest rates, and via interest rates over non-financial economic activity, stems from the central bank's role as a monopolist over the supply of bank reserves. Several trends already visible in the financial markets of many countries today threaten to weaken or even undermine the relevance of that monopoly, and with it the efficacy of monetary policy. These developments include the erosion of the demand for bank-issued money, the proliferation of non-bank credit and aspects of the operation of bank clearing mechanisms. What to make of these threats from a public policy perspective – in particular, whether to undertake potentially aggressive regulatory measures in an effort to forestall them – depends in large part on one's view of the contribution of monetary policy towards successful economic performance.

TI  - Reflections on the Natural Rate of Interest, its Measurement, Monetary Policy and the Zero Lower Bound
AU  - Cukierman, Alex
AB  - Persistent decreases in interest rates since the beginning of the twenty first century and the intensification of this trend with the onset of the global financial crisis nurtured the view that the natural rate is substantially lower than it used to be, and by some estimates, even persistently negative.  Although investment activity depends mainly on risky rates existing estimates of the natural rate focus mainly on estimation of natural (mostly short term) riskless rates. Gilchrist and Zakrajsek (2012) find that, particularly during crisis times, risky and riskless rates tend to move in opposite directions and that the spread between risky and riskless rates is a good predictor of subsequent economic activity. Drawing on those findings the paper makes a case for conceptualizing and estimating a risky natural rate. This rate which better reflects the impact of the financial system on economic activity, is practically always bounded away from the zero lower bound.

AU  - Kohlscheen, Emanuel

AB  - The departure from the Modigliani-Miller conditions, due for instance to market incompleteness, asymmetric information or taxation, tends to increase the importance of indirect channels by which monetary policy affects the level of economic activity in emerging market economies (EMEs). The bank lending channel highlighted by Bernanke and Blinder (1988) is a prominent example of such indirect effect of monetary policy. In this study we investigate how the bank lending channel acts above and beyond the traditional money channel that most macroeconomic models emphasize. We find that, particularly in EMEs with high bank reliance, changes in the volume of bank credit are important drivers of fixed capital formation. Using micro-level bank balance sheet data, we then show how monetary policy and sovereign risk premia affected bank credit growth in EMEs between 2001 and 2013. We find that both, changes in the monetary policy stance and changes in risk premia have had significant effects on credit volumes. Furthermore, we show that these effects tend to affect smaller banks more strongly. Our results suggest that the accommodative monetary policies that have been seen recently were contributing factors to the rapid expansion of credit in many EMEs.

I present statistical evidence that the response of the two asset prices have indeed been unusually large relative to the past experience with nonconventional monetary policy (NCM) even after allowance is given for the rise in global economic activity and asset prices. I also point out that the rally has been led by speculative trading by foreign investors, while domestic investors have largely stayed on the sidelines. I discuss possible reasons for such foreign investor behavior. Simply put, the unprecedented political pressure raised hopes of the adoption of bold measures by the Bank of Japan. I discuss, however, the possibility that the room for further action by the Bank is quite limited apart from what might be called a targeted helicopter drop of money. I also point out the possibility that investor behavior may have not been based on economic fundamentals. The asset price volatility since April 2013 is interpreted in the light of such discussions.

AB  - Some key structural features of the U.S. economy appear to have changed in the recent decades, making the conduct of monetary policy more challenging. In particular, there is high uncertainty about the levels of the natural rate of interest and unemployment as well as about the effect of economic activity on inflation. At the same time, a prolonged period of below-target inflation has raised concerns about the unanchoring of inflation expectations at levels below the Federal Open Market Committee’s inflation target. In addition, a low natural rate of interest increases the probability of hitting the effective lower bound during a downturn. This paper studies how these factors complicate the attainment of the objectives specified in the Federal Reserve’s dual mandate in the context of a DSGE (dynamic stochastic general equilibrium) model, taking into account risk-management considerations. We find that these challenges may warrant pursuing more accommodative policy than would be desirable otherwise. However, such accommodative policy could be associated with concerns about risks to financial markets.

AB  - The paper determines episodes of financial stress in Belarus during 2004-2016 period using constructed financial stress index, and offers an analytical framework to evaluate the influence of financial turmoil on Belarus's economy, in particular economic activity and monetary policy. The findings show evidence of two episodes of financial stress and two episodes of recessions in Belarus during studied period. The results from the estimated ARDL models show that high level of financial stress causes the substantial downturn in economic activity of Belarus. Moreover, the results of Toda and Yamamoto causality analysis indicate that higher financial stress in Belarus has led to lower economic activity that caused higher inflation, which in turn led to higher policy rate introduced in order to constrain inflation in Belarus. Finally, from theoretical point of view results also signify that there is no evidence for the support of the conventional wisdom hypothesis in Belarus since 2004. Therefore, price stability is not a sufficient condition to support financial stability in Belarus and should certainly be addressed independently with the objective of price stability of the National Bank of Belarus.

AB  - The objective of the study is to assess the effect monetary policy variables on savings, national income and investment as proxies to the real sector economy in Nigeria. This is relevant to the economy as differences in transmission mechanisms can generate asymmetric behaviour between monetary policy and real sector. The paper explores the significance of this channel using VAR model, as tests suggest the null hypothesis of no significant effect was rejected and a conclusion was drawn that one of the monetary variables such as money supply exert a significant impact on the real sector economy. The main implication to be drawn from these results seems to be the importance of monetary policy channel in regulating real sector economy in Nigeria. The effect of money supply shocks on real sector variables are similar and seem to be significant too. Thus with respect to this result, monetary policy regulators should use money supply regularly as a mechanism to improve real sector economy in Nigeria.

T2  - University of Wollongong Thesis Collection 1954-2016
AB  - This research studies the monetary policy transmission mechanisms in Indonesia. It aims at achieving six objectives. First, it investigates not only the channels associated with monetary-policy-induced changes in the financial markets but also those associated with the monetary-policy-induced changes in the goods market. Second, it assesses and compares the relative strength of each channel of monetary policy transmission, which has not been attempted previously in the case of the Indonesia. This attempt is made possible by the use of a single model to investigate the multiple channels of monetary policy transmission. Third, it examines whether the 1998 financial crisis has changed the course of each channel of monetary policy transmission. Specifically, whether the role played by each channel in the monetary policy transmission weakened or strengthened is investigated. Fourth, to achieve these objectives a structural vector autoregressive (SVAR) model of the Indonesian economy is constructed. However, before these objectives are addressed the issue of whether the monetary policy shocks have plausible macroeconomic effects is dealt with. To that end, a nonrecursive identifying strategy is applied. Likewise, the complexity of the actual monetary policy conduct in Indonesia that makes it hard to single out the monetary policy instruments actually in use in Indonesia is mitigated by devising eight SVAR specifications. Fifth, it addresses the issue of non-stationary data in VAR modelling by conducting unit root test that allows for one and two endogenouslydetermined breaks. Specifically, this study examines the robustness of the Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) unit root test to the presence of one and/or more structural breaks. Given the fact that most time series data have structural breaks, such an attempt has not been done in the case of Indonesia. Finally, it attempts to solve the identification problem associated with bank lending channel using cointegration procedures based on the autoregressive distributive lag (ARDL) model and the impulse response function analysis that have not been applied to an Indonesian case. (One advantage of the ARDL approach is that it is appropriate irrespective of whether the time series data used are integrated of degree one or zero).

SVAR model specification that captures the most plausible effects of monetary policy shocks is selected out of eight specifications of the SVAR model of the Indonesian economy estimated using both monthly and quarterly data from 1984M12- 2003M12 (1984Q4-2003Q4). The eight different SVAR models are estimated out of the fact that in reality there are four potential measures of monetary aggregates: total reserves, base money, narrow money (M1) and broad money (M2) and two potential measures of short-term interest rates: interbank call-money rate (R1) and SBI rate (interest rate on Bank Indonesia bills) (R2) as monetary policy instruments.

Based on the estimated impulse response analyses, the specification that best captures the effects of monetary policy shocks, as expected by theory, is selected. Overall, the monthly eight-variable SVAR specification that uses M2 as measure of monetary aggregate and R1 as short-term interest rate is superior to the other specifications. However, the quarterly version of the same specification is superior to all other specifications because it resolves the exchange rate puzzle (the initial depreciation of exchange rate following a monetary tightening). This model specification is used to empirically assess the relative strength of channels associated with the monetary-policyinduced changes in the financial and goods markets. In regards to the latter, it has shown empirically, relying on the concept of contribution derived from estimated SVAR models, that consumption spending plays a predominant role in the monetary transmission mechanisms. This result is more in line with the findings regarding the United States than with those regarding the Europe and Japan. For the latter countries investment spending is predominant in the monetary transmission mechanisms.

As for the channels associated with the monetary-policy-induced changes in the financial markets, this study finds that bank loans are dominant. The accumulated response of output attributed to this channel is stronger than the exchange rate and asset price channels. A monetary tightening shock leads to a fall in bank credit, with a lag of about three quarters. However, the importance of bank loans has been exaggerated by the credit crunch during the financial crisis period. The role of bank loans is weaker during the period before the financial crisis, although stronger than the other two channels.

The finding on the bank lending channel suffers an identification problem: do the monetary-policy-induced movements in bank loans originate from the supply or demand side? The “credit view” of monetary policy transmission requires that the former is the case. The estimation of error correction models where the cointegating vectors allow for one structural break and are based on the Johansen’s and Autoregressive Distributive Lag (ARDL) procedures find that the former is the case. Further, the impulse response analysis based on both vector error correction (VEC) models of the bank loans market and the eight-variable SVAR corroborates this result irrespective of the origin of shock, monetary policy or otherwise. Likewise, the first requirement of the credit view that a monetary tightening by the central bank is capable of constraining the supply of bank loans is satisfied. Similarly, this analysis also satisfies the second requirement of the credit view that the monetary-induced decline in the supply of bank loans depresses aggregate spending due to the significance of the bank-dependent borrowers. Thus, the bank lending channel is confirmed.

The exchange rate channel is found to be the weakest. The reason is that during and after the financial crisis there are anomalies associated with this channel. The exchange rate channel operates against the conventional wisdom. A monetary tightening shock is accompanied by exchange rate depreciation and subsequently weakening the level of economic activity. These anomalies disappear when the estimation covers observations before the financial crisis only. These anomalies are due to the fact that during the crisis period the exchange rate depreciation was so enormous that monetary policy tightening had little or no effect in arresting the depreciation pressure. Further, since Indonesia is a highly indebted economy the enormous exchange rate depreciation has inflated the foreign-currency-denominated debts and hence greatly worsened firms’ balance sheets, thereby depressing firms’ investment and productive capacity and hence the level of economic activity.

As for the asset price channel, the results reveal that the equity price channel is also weaker than the bank loans channel but slightly stronger than the exchange rate channel. Due to the collapse of stock market and sharp decrease in the use of equity financing during the financial crisis period, the equity price channel of monetary policy transmission had weakened during that period. Further, to the extent that this channel follows Monetarist view or Tobin’s view, the latter seems to play a dominant role. That is, the real effect of this channel is mainly due to investment spending increases spurred by higher Tobin’s q resulting from the increase in stock price following a monetary easing. Finally, this study also confirms the occurrence of credit crunch following the financial crisis.

AB  - This article examines the influence of Policy Mix coherence in Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS). The paper innovates in two ways. First, through an interaction between the monetary conditions index and the primary structural fiscal balance, we highlight coherence-type complementarities between monetary policy and fiscal policy with regard to their effects on economic activity. Second, we show that the influence of the coherence of policy mix on the effect of monetary policy is different according to the stance of the economy within the four possible regimes of policy mix, mostly in the WAEMU subsample, where integration is deeper than in the non-WAEMU countries, thanks to the common currency (the Franc CFA) they share. The analysis is based upon a panel dataset from 1990 to 2006 and remains robust to alternative specifications used to calculate the monetary conditions index. Our results contribute to the debate regarding the prospect of an ECOWAS-wide common currency. Indeed, given the heterogeneity in the economic structure of its members States, more policy mix coherence seems necessary to avoid unexpected impacts of monetary policy on economic activity.

AU  - Ahmed, Shaghil

AU  - Queralto, Albert
AB  - We explore how the sources of shocks driving interest rates, country vulnerabilities, and central bank communications affect the spillovers of U.S. monetary policy changes to emerging market economies (EMEs). We utilize a two-country New Keynesian model with financial frictions and partly dollarized balance sheets, as well as poorly anchored inflation expectations reflecting imperfect monetary policy credibility in vulnerable EMEs. Contrary to other recent studies that also emphasize the sources of shocks, our approach allows the quantification of effects on real macroeconomic variables as well, in addition to financial spillovers. Moreover, we model the most relevant vulnerabilities structurally. We show that higher U.S. interest rates arising from stronger U.S. aggregate demand generate modestly positive spillovers to economic activity in EMEs with stronger fundamentals but can be adverse for vulnerable EMEs. In contrast, U.S. monetary tightening’s driven by a more-hawkish policy stance cause a substantial slowdown in activity in all EMEs. Our model also captures the challenging policy tradeoffs that EME central banks face, and we show that these tradeoffs can potentially be improved by clearer communications from them.

AB  - This paper uses a VAR approach to study the transmission of monetary policy shocks in Portugal, focusing in particular on the financial decisions of households, corporations (financial/non-financial), the government and the rest of the world. We confirm that, in many ways, households and firms react in a similar way as found in other countries, with evidence that the monetary policy shock has a contractionary effect on economic activity and increases the financing needs of households and non-financial corporations. We also find evidence that the financial sector plays an important role, supplying the necessary funds to these sectors. We do not find much evidence of a significant systematic behaviour of the government or the rest of the world.

AB  - Since the global financial crisis, there has been a significant amount of concern about the presence of large-scale financial intermediaries which affects the competitive landscape of the banking sector in advanced economies. In light of this issue, this paper develops a framework to demonstrate how the degree of concentration impacts economic activity. As is standard in the growth literature, we incorporate production externalities from the aggregate capital stock which promote economic development. In this setting, we show that monetary policy may need to accommodate departures from perfect competition by setting a higher rate of money growth. In fact, in the presence of large capital externalities, neither low inflation nor perfect competition may be optimal. That is, in environments where capital accumulation would be expected to be inefficiently low, the optimal rate of money growth is higher than the Friedman rule in order to encourage investment—yet, the optimal competitive structure favors increased concentration to foster a large seigniorage tax base that also adds to the capital stock.

AB  - We develop a small open economy macroeconomic model where financial conditions influence aggregate behavior. Our goal is to explore the connection between the exchange rate regime and financial distress. We first show that a calibrated version of the model captures well the behavior of the Korean economy during its financial crisis period of 1997?98. In particular, the model accounts for the sharp increase in lending rates and the large drop in output, employment, investment, and measured productivity. The financial market frictions play an important role, further, explaining roughly half the decline in overall economic activity. We then perform some counterfactual exercises to illustrate how the fixed exchange rate regime likely exacerbated the crisis by tying the hands of monetary policy.

The findings are in conflict with some monetarist models, in that fiscal policy, as well as monetary policy, strongly influences regional basic economic activity.

AB  - Updated version is available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3796552We investigate the effect of monetary policy on European macroeconomic variables using a small-scale vector autoregression (VAR) and the "Effective Monetary Stimulus" (EMS). The EMS is a monetary policy metric obtained from yield curve data that is designed to consistently reflect the overall stance of monetary policy across conventional and uncoventional monetary policy environments.  Empirically, using the EMS in our VAR obtains plausible and stable structural relationships with prices and output developments across and within conventional and unconventional environments, and more so than short-maturity rates or alternative metrics, suggesting that it provides a useful practical monetary policy metric for policy makers.  The VAR results show that European monetary policy shocks have been accommodative since 2007, although their effect has become more uncertain compared to the conventional policy period.

AU  - Andolfatto, David
AB  - The author studies a simple dynamic general equilibrium monetary model to interpret key macroeconomic developments in the U.S. economy both before and after the Great Recession. In normal times, when the Federal Reserveâ€™s policy rate is above the interest paid on reserves, countercyclical monetary policy works in a textbook manner. When a shock drives the policy rate to the zero lower bound, the economy enters a liquidity-trap scenario in which open market purchases of government securities have no real or nominal effects, apart from expanding the supply of excess reserves in the banking sector. In a liquidity trap, the Fed loses all control of inflation, which is now determined entirely by the fiscal authority. In normal times, raising the interest paid on reserves stimulates economic activity, but in a liquidity trap, raising the interest paid on reserves retards economic activity.

AU  - Chingarande, Anna
AB  - This paper examines the impact of monetary and fiscal policies on economic activity in Zimbabwe by employing a modified St Louis equation for the period 1981:4 to 1998:3. The main objective is to determine the relative effectiveness of monetary and fiscal policies on the economic growth process in Zimbabwe using the new econometric techniques of time series, cointegration and error correction approach. Secondary data was collected from various publications like, Government of Zimbabwe (1987): Annual Economic Review of Zimbabwe, Central Statistical Office (1998) National Accounts 1985-97 and Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe (various issues) monthly and quarterly bulletins. Quarterly data was used to make a total of 68 observations. LIMDEP Version 6.0 and PC GIVE Version 8 packages were used for data analysis. The regression results suggest that the monetary influence is relatively stronger and more predictable than fiscal policy in determining economic activity. These results suggest that monetary policy can be relied on as a successful macroeconomic stabilization tool in Zimbabwe. Fiscal policy should be streamlined as it is found to have an insignificant impact on economic activity in Zimbabwe. The impulse dummies which are included in the model in order to reduce the impact of outliers in the scaled residuals were also found to be significant. These impulse dummies are for the period when Zimbabwe experienced severe drought and also a bumper harvest. Exports had an insignificant impact on economic activity.

AB  - This paper uses a FAVAR model with external instruments to show that monetary policy uncertainty shocks are recessionary and are associated with an increase in firms' exit and a decrease in firms' entry. At the same time, the stock price declines, while the TFP increases in the medium run. To explain this result, we build up and estimate a medium-scale DSGE model featuring firm heterogeneity and endogenous firm entry and exit. These features are crucial in matching the empirical responses. The baseline model outperforms an alternative model without firm dynamics in reproducing the FAVAR responses and implies a larger effect of monetary policy uncertainty shock on the real economic activity.

AB  - , ABSTRACT:, Would a more open and regular evaluation of the monetary policy framework improve policy in the United States? Even when considering a relatively short time frame spanning the 1960s to the present, it is possible to point to many significant changes to the framework. Some of the changes were precipitated by acute economic conditions; others were considered and implemented only gradually, as a response to long-standing problems with the framework. But to date, the process for evaluating and changing frameworks has not always been transparent, and changes have not always been timely. Could a more formal, and open, review process improve how well we adhere to our current framework? Could transitions to a new framework be made more effectively? We conclude that such a review might indeed be beneficial, and outline one possible review process.

AU  - Hataiseree, Rungsun
AB  - This paper demonstrates that, in small open economies, focusing on interest rate and the exchange rate seems particularly important in policy making because the exchange rate may be a primary channel through which monetary policy affects inflation and economic activity. The Monetary Conditions Index (MCI) can be used to compare the degree of importance between interest rate and the exchange rate in influencing the future inflation rate. Empirically, it was found that the MCI ratio for Thailand takes the value of 3.3:1. This ratio implies that when the baht is expected to depreciate at an average rate of 3.3% in any particular time, ceteris paribus, the interest rate needs to be raised by an average of 1% in order to prevent the expectation of the baht depreciation from effecting the forecasting of the future inflation rate.

E-money poses a challenge to central banks’ ability to control interest rates, and it may also increase endogenous financial instability. The challenge to interest rate control stems from the possibility that e-money may diminish the financial system’s demand for central bank liabilities, rendering central banks unable to conduct meaningful open market operations. Increasedfinancial instability could emerge from the increased elasticity of private money production, and from periodic runs out of e-money into central bank money that generate liquidity crises.

TI  - On Asymmetric Effects in a Monetary Policy Rule: The Case of Poland
AU  - Sznajderska, Anna
AB  - Asymmetric effects in a monetary policy rule could appear due to asymmetric preferences of the central bank or/and due to nonlinearities in the economic system. It might be suspected that monetary authorities are more aggressive to the inflation rate when it is above its target level than when it is below. It also seems probable that monetary authorities have different preferences and react more strongly when the level of economic activity is low than when it is high. In this paper we investigate whether the reaction function of the National Bank of Poland (NBP) is asymmetric according to the level of inflation gap and the level of output gap. Moreover, we test whether these asymmetries might possibly stem from the nonlinearities in the Phillips curve. Threshold models are applied and two cases of unknown and known threshold value are investigated.

AB  - To assess whether and how the e¤ects of monetary policy shocks depend on credit market conditions, we introduce endogenous regime switching in the parameters of a Multivariate Autoregressive Index model. We develop a Bayesian framework to estimate dynamic responses to structural shocks using the proposed nonlinear vector autoregressive model applied to a large number of endogenous variables. The computed responses of economic activity and prices to monetary policy tightening/easing and large/small shocks are asymmetric. And these asymmetries are explained by the e¤ect of monetary policy shocks on credit conditions and the probability of regime changes.

AB  - This paper examines in detail the characteristics of credit to the non-government sector, including both interest and non-interest terms, in fourteen industrial countries and considers its potential implications for the transmission mechanism of monetary policy. Three findings merit particular attention. First, the share of securities in total credit is comparatively high in Anglo-Saxon countries. Second, most Anglo-Saxon countries are characterised by a relatively high share of adjustable rate credit. This is due primarily to the widespread use of adjustable rate mortgages by households. Outside the Anglo-Saxon group, the main exception is Italy; inside it, the United States. Third, the share of loans backed by real estate collateral appears to be comparatively high in most Anglo-Saxon countries. Elsewhere, it is very high in Sweden and Switzerland. There are also indications that the share is relatively high in Japan. To varying degrees, the above characteristics should be expected to amplify the impact of monetary policy on economic activity. Their relevance is broadly consistent with the cross-country pattern of results of simulations of national central bank models.

AB  - The coincidence in the 1970s of apparently large, structural federal deficits, substantial and growing unemployment and inflation rising to double-digit levels brought widespread questioning of the hitherto dominant Keynesian paradigm. Indeed, Robert Lucas (Lucas and Sargent, 1978; Lucas, 1981) indicated this coincidence as a motivation for his own rejection of that paradigm and search for new macroeconomic theory. In short, he explained, the Keynesian model suggested that expansive fiscal and monetary policies might cause some inflation but would reduce unemployment. But to the contrary, he indicated, these policies begot accelerating inflation and high unemployment.

TI  - Economic Fluctuation, Macro Control, and Monetary Policy in the Transitional Chinese Economy
AU  - Yu, Qiao

AB  - Since 1978, China has experienced four episodes of economic fluctuations, during which the government used macro controls to restore stability. This paper finds that (i) tight monetary policy reinforced by administrative actions checks the economic overheating, (ii) monetary policy affects significantly industrial output, retail sales, and prices, but it has no effect on fixed-asset investment and merchandise imports, (iii) a long-run stable relationship exists between financial variables and economic activity, and (vi) money aggregates outperform bank credits in predicting future changes in activities. The evidence provides ways for the People's Bank of China to improve the effectiveness of monetary policy.J. Comp. Econom.,October 1997,25(2), pp. 180–195.

TI  - Monetary Policy Independence and Bond Yield in Developing Countries
AU  - Anwar, Cep Jandi
AU  - Suhendra, Indra
T2  - The Journal of Asian Finance, Economics and Business
AB  - This paper investigates the impact of monetary policy independence shock on bond yield by allowing for heterogeneous coefficients in the model based on panel data for 19 developing countries using quarterly data from 1991 to 2016. First, we estimate the model using conventional panel VAR estimation with the assumption of homogeneous coefficients across countries. Second, by performing Chow and Roy-Zellner tests to check the homogeneity assumption, we find that the assumption does not hold in the model. Third, we apply a mean-group estimation for panel VAR as a solution for heterogeneity panel model. The results reveal that central bank independence is effective in reducing bond yield with the maximum at period 6 after the shock. Shock one standard deviation bond yield has a negative effect on consumption and investment. We determine that central bank independence has a contradictory effect on real activity; a negative effect on consumption but a positive influence on investment for the first two years after the shock. Additionally, we split our sample into three groups to make the subgroups pool. Our empirical result shows that monetary policy independence shock reduces bond yield. Meanwhile, the response of economic activity to bond yield varies for all three groups.

TI  - Monetary Policy, Macroprudential Regulation and Inequality
AU  - Monnin, Pierre
AB  - The 2008 global financial crisis profoundly changed the role of central banks in the economy. First, central banks engaged in strong expansionary monetary policy, using new unconventional tools to boost economic activity. Second, they were key to containing financial instability, which led them to implement new macroprudential policies to foster future financial stability. The debate about whether these policies have been effective is still ongoing, and often neglects two other crucial issues: What has been the impact of these policies on income and wealth distribution? Does inequality of income and wealth affect whether central bank policies reach their targets?

T2  - Brookings Papers on Economic Activity
AB  - , ABSTRACT:, On June 1, 2018, the European Central Bank (ECB) celebrated its 20th anniversary. This paper provides a comprehensive view of the ECB's monetary policy over these two decades. The first section gives a chronological account of the macroeconomic and monetary policy developments in the euro area since the adoption of the euro in 1999, going through four cyclical phases "conditioning" ECB monetary policy. We describe the monetary policy decisions from the ECB's perspective and against the background of its evolving monetary policy strategy and framework. We also highlight a number of the key, critical issues that were the subject of debate. The second section contains various assessments. We analyze the achievement of the price stability mandate and developments in the ECB's credibility, and we also investigate the ECB's interest rate decisions through the lens of a simple empirical interest rate reaction function. Finally, we present the ECB's framework for thinking about nonstandard monetary policy measures and review the evidence on their effectiveness. One of the main themes of the paper is how the ECB utilized its monetary policy to respond to the challenges posed by the European twin financial and sovereign debt crises and the subsequent slow economic recovery, making use of its relatively wide range of instruments, defining new ones where necessary, and developing the strategic underpinnings of its policy framework.
