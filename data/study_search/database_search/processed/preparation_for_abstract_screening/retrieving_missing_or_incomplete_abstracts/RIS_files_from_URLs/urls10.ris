AB  - This study examines the impact of monetary policy on economic performance in sub-Saharan Africa covering the period from 2005 to 2019. The study employs Blundell and Bond system GMM technique for the estimation. Three indicators - economic growth, foreign direct investment and gross domestic savings were used to proxy economic performance. The study reveals that monetary policy is an important factor in the determination of economic performance in the sub-Saharan African countries. The study concludes that sub-Saharan African countries could effectively use monetary policy to improve economic growth, attracts foreign investment and encourages domestic savings, which ultimately lead to well-being of the citizens.

TI  - What Should Central Banks Target? Evidence on the Impact of Monetary Policy Regimes on Economic Growth
AU  - Wong, Kin Ming
AU  - Chong, Terence Tai-Leung
AB  - Economists and policy-makers have long sought the ideal framework for monetary policy as it is arguably one of the most important tools for government to influence the economy. Exchange rate and inflation are believed to be the most appealing anchors for providing guidance to the conduct of monetary policy and are thus widely used in the real world. Most existing studies on the effect of exchange-rate arrangements and inflation targeting on economic growth suffer from the absence of a clear counterfactual, rendering it difficult to interpret their results. Based on a new classification scheme on monetary policy regimes, this paper helps to fill that gap by investigating the effect of monetary policy regimes on growth. Our results consistently support that an inflation targeting regime has a positive impact on economic growth when compared with an exchange-rate targeting regime.

T2  - Sustainability
AB  - It is necessary to analyze the relationship between financial inclusion and circumstances-monetary policy and economic fundamentals, which has a practical reference value for policy makers. This paper studies the impact of the circumstances on financial inclusion factors by using a vector autoregressive method. Empirical results show that monetary policy has a short-term positive impact on financial inclusion factors, while the economic fundamental has the opposite, which means that the positive monetary policy promote the development of financial inclusion in the short term and the sudden change of the economic situation will make it harder. Based on the data of the World Bank and the situation of China, we make an analysis and comparison of the empirical results, and draw two implications: first, the sustainable development of financial inclusion needs a suitable circumstance; second, the appropriate coordination and mutual facilitation of economic fundamentals and finance is conducive to the sustainable development of financial inclusion.

TI  - The Impact of Fiscal and Monetary Policy on Economic Growth in Southern African Custom Union (SACU) Member Economies between 1980 and 2017: A Panel ARDL Approach
AU  - Monamodi, Nkosinathi
AB  - This study seeks to investigate the impact of fiscal and monetary policy on economic growth in Southern African Custom Union (SACU) member economies between 1980 and 2017. Government expenditure and revenue were used as the proxy variables for the fiscal policy whereas real interest rate, inflation, official exchange rate and M2 money supply were used as the proxy variables for monetary policy. Using Lin, Levin and Chu (LLC), and Im, Peresan and Shin (IPS) unit root tests, it was found that all variables were stationary at level except for M2 money supply which was found to be stationary after first difference. Due to this, Panel Auto Regression Distributed Lags (PARDL) estimation technique was utilized in this study. On the basis that the number of variables under study (eight, including the dependent variable) are greater than the number of SACU participants (five economies), and some common characteristics on both fiscal and monetary policy revealed by this study, Pooled Mean Group (PMG) PARDL model estimator was used in this study. The results indicate that fiscal and monetary policy influence economic growth significantly across SACU member economies in the long run. However, fiscal policy is only significant if government expenditure is used as the functional policy instrument rather than government revenue. In the short run, the effects of these two macroeconomic policies on economic growth are mixed. In determining the direction of the long run relationship, Granger causality results indicate that the direction is from government expenditure, real interest rate, inflation and official exchange rate to economic growth. These causality links are uni-directional in nature. Lastly, the results also indicate that private investment is crowded out in the long run because of significant high levels of government expenditure in the long run across SACU member economies. In the short run, private investment is crowded out because of significant high level of government expenditure only in Swaziland.

TI  - The Dynamic Effects of Urban–Rural Income Inequality on Sustainable Economic Growth under Urbanization and Monetary Policy in China
AU  - Cheng, Junli
AU  - Lin, Feng
T2  - Sustainability
AB  - Income inequality in China has become increasingly serious since the beginning of the economic reform period in the 1970s, with urban–rural income inequality playing a large role. Urbanization policy and monetary policy are currently important economic policy tools for the Chinese government. In order to investigate the influence of inequality on the economy and to provide recommendations for ensuring the sustainability of growth, we study the effect of urban–rural income inequality on economic growth in the context of urbanization and monetary policy in China between 2002 and 2021. Using a flexible time-varying parametric structural vector auto-regression (TVP-VAR) model and a robust Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm, our empirical results show that the effect is time-varying, with inequality promoting growth in the early years but affecting it adversely at later stages. Currently, urbanization mitigates inequality and promotes growth simultaneously, while easy monetary policy worsens inequality and affects growth adversely in the long term. We suggest that the authorities need to consider the implementation of policy rebalancing to ensure that the sustainability of economic development is not jeopardized because of worsening income disparity. Proactive urbanization policy and prudent monetary policy are viable rebalancing options.

AB  - This study revisits the growth effects of monetary policy, patent breadth, and blocking patents in a monetary Schumpeterian model. In the economy, there are cash constraints on R&D investment and the step size of innovation is endogenous. Within this framework, innovation policies affect economic growth through the arrival rate and the quality size of innovation. We find that with an endogenous innovation size, each of the three innovation policy instruments may have an inverted-U-shaped effect on growth. Moreover, we calibrate the model and quantify the interactive effects of innovation policies. Our results show that the interaction of different innovation policies significantly influences the growth effect of a single policy.

AB  - Using micro data on non-financial listed companies in Pakistan, over the period of 2000-2010, this paper emphasizes the impact of monetary policy on economic growth through balance sheet channel. At first step, monetary tightening deteriorates the net worth of the firms and leads to cash flow squeeze which in turn affects the economic growth. We find this impact to last for three years over the balance sheets of the firms. Since industrial sector drives the economic growth, we forecast corporate profitability at the second step. Empirical investigation shows that corporate profitability reverts to its mean at the rate of 25 percent. During peak, mean reversion is 30 percent while it is 19 percent during trough implying that recession stays relatively longer and economic revival is slow during recessionary phase.

AB  - Purpose The market-based monetary policy framework has been favoured by Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) economies. Hence, this study aims to investigate the effect of monetary policy channels on the sectoral value added and sustainable economic growth in ECOWAS. Data from the World Bank and International Monetary Fund over 2013–2019 were sourced for thirteen member countries. ECOWAS is found to have very high inflation level, interest and exchange rates. Design/methodology/approach The study adopted the Driscoll–Kraay fixed-effects ordinary least squares regression (OLS) estimator. Findings The findings revealed that while the effect of monetary policy channels on the agricultural sector value added is largely heterogenous and significantly in-elastic, the one on the industrial and services sectors are overwhelmingly homogeneous and negative, but insignificant for the services sector. Moreover, the effect of monetary policy channels on sustainable economic growth is also homogeneously asymmetric, with imminent stagflation, while the interactive effects of monetary policy channels are heterogeneous on sustainable economic growth and economic sectors. Therefore, an inflation targeting monetary policy stance is generally recommended with prioritised exchange rate stabilisation amid sufficient fiscal space. Originality/value This is amongst the first studies to investigate monetary policy channels, sectoral outputs and sustainable growth in the ECOWAS region with a rigorous analysis and found implications for policy.

The results revealed that the negative shocks have much more effects on output than positive ones. Monetary disequilibrium also has asymmetric effects on economic growth so that the coefficient of excess money supply is not significant in any specifications, whereas excess demand have a negative significant effect on economic growth. Therefore, although policy makers can stimulate slightly short run economic growth by increasing unexpected money, they must pay a higher cost in the long run to decrease inflation.

AB  - This study seeks to empirically explore the impact of key monetary policy variables on the economic growth in the CEMAC zone from the period of 1981 to 2015. Carried out using the Ex post facto research design based on the principal components selection approach, the study interacts money supply, interest rate, economic growth, and inflation rate, among themselves and their lagged values using the Vector Auto-regressive (VAR) analytical technique. The Classical quantity theory of money, the Cambridge Cash Balanced, the liquidity preference theory and the Monetarists as theoretical frameworks were explored to appreciate the time trends of the selected variables on the economic growth of the CEMAC zone. Based on the (VAR) methodology, the study reveals that key monetary policy variables influence economic growth of the CEMAC zone in different ways with inflation rate as the impact factor. On the basis of the above findings and the evidence from other studies, lending and inflation rate generated substantial destabilizing impacts on the economic growth, suggesting that the monetary authorities should play a critical role in creating an enabling environment for growth. The determination of the optimal lending rate should reflect the overall internal rate of returns in the productive sectors with due attention to market fundamentals. In line with this, the Central Bank of CEMAC should be given complete instrumental autonomy to operate depending on a set of in-built targets by the individual countries of the zone. Effective monetary targeting and accommodating monetary policies should be designed and implemented as the need arises with little or no political motives.

T2  - Asian Economic Papers
AB  - Abstract
            This paper illustrates Taiwan's experience in controlling the virus and curbing the impact of COVID-19 on its economy. All the following factors contributed to Taiwan's early success in fighting COVID-19: the early establishment of a command center, the “precision-prevention” model of strategies that includes tight border controls and strict quarantine policy, the procuring of sufficient anti-pandemic medical supplies, and educating residents about public health awareness (e.g., promoting face mask wearing in public, maintaining proper social distance, and handwashing procedures). In addition, the country's medical facilities and a national health insurance program that are already in place along with the utilization of technology and big data also played a crucial role during the pandemic. Taiwan's success story may open up opportunities for the country to assume a leading role as a facilitator in the reallocation of the global supply chain and the creation of a new worldwide health coalition that includes Taiwan, unlike its lonely efforts 17 years ago when SARS hit the Southeast Asian and Pacific regions.

AB  - The growing importance of monetary policy has made its effectiveness in influencing economic growth a priority to most governments. Therefore the study investigates the impact of monetary policy on economic growth in Nigeria from 1986 to 2019, by using interest rate variables for monetary policy and GDP as a proxy for economic growth. The study applied the autoregressive distributive lag (ARDL) model to analyze the data. The result shows that interest rate and domestic credit have a statistically significant impact on economic growth in Nigeria while the exchange rate on the other hand has a statically non-significant effect on economic growth. It is therefore recommends that the central bank of Nigeria should continue to use appropriate monetary policy instruments to support Nigeria’s economic growth taking into account economic and political conditions in the country.

AB  - The objective of this study is to analyze the interdependency between monetary policy instruments and Indonesian economic growth for the periods of 2000 to 2011. The monetary policy instruments are open market operation (OPT), reserve requirement (RR), and discount rate. For the analysis, this study employs Structural Vector Autoregression, and Impulse Response Function. The results of the analysis show that Open market Operation (OPT), Reserve Requirement (RR), and discount interest rate (rDiskonto) have some degrees of interdependency on economic growth (GROW) through other intermediary macroeconomic variables. These variables are exchange rate, exports, imports, investment, and balance of payment, unemployment and inflation. Impulse Response Function showing a shock in OPT by one standard deviation has a negative effect on economic growth (for short-, medium, and longterms) through out. In other words, if OPT increases, economic growth decreases. An increase in Reserve Requirement (RR) has an immediate negative impact on growth. In a slightly longer period, the impact of RR on growth becomes positive. However, in other periods (medium- and long-terms) the impact of RR on growth was negative. The increased rDiskonto can increase growth in the medium term, contrary to other periods.

The impulseresponse results show that monetary policy with an interest rate policyinstrument hurts economic growth in the short run and is positive inthe long run. In the short run, an expansionary monetary policy haseffectively accelerated economic growth, vice versa. International tradepositively affects economic growth in ASEAN-4 countries in the shortrun and vice versa in the long run. Panel data analysis shows a pricepuzzle regarding the effect of interest rates on inflation.

AU  - Lu, You-Xun

AU  - Lai, Ching-chong
AB  - An important aspect of economic growth is the interaction between incumbents and new firms. In this study, we develop a monetary Schumpeterian model with an endogenous market structure (EMS) and two types of quality improvements (the own-product improvements of incumbents and creative destruction of entrants) to analyze the effects of monetary policy. The key finding of our analysis is that an increase in the nominal interest rate importantly affects the composition of innovation that drives economic growth, stimulating the incumbents’ own-product improvements and reducing the entrants’ creative destruction. Therefore, the growth effect of monetary policy is ambiguous, and depends on the relative magnitudes of the incumbents’ and entrants’ contributions to R&D and growth. Finally, we provide a quantitative analysis of the growth and welfare effects of monetary policy and consider an extension of the benchmark model with an elastic labor supply and a CIA constraint on consumption.

TI  - Impact of Monetary Policy on Economic Diversification in Nigeria: Further Empirical Analysis
AU  - Stella, Omang

AB  - One of the key objectives of the government’s economic policy is the prosperity and stability of the economy. It intends to achieve this by increasing the economy’s competitiveness in the global economic arena. However, besides the macroeconomic policy, another key determinant of an economy’s competitiveness is the extent of its diversification, understood in this context to mean the degree to which the economy moves away from a dominant income-earning sector or product to other ones. In view of this, study examined the impact of monetary policy on economic diversification in Nigeria using data for the period 1991 to 2021 and the Autoregressive Distributed Lag (ARDL) bounds testing approach. The study made use of diversification index as the dependent variable, money supply, real exchange rate, gross fix capital formation, labour force ,as independent variables. Secondary time series data were collected from the Central Bank of Nigeria Statistical Bulletin, National Bureau of Statistics (various years/issues). Descriptive statistics and multiple regression analysis based on the ARDL technique. Based on the results obtained, the study shows that money supply, gross fix capita formation and labour force affects economic diversification positively while real effective exchange rate affects economic diversification negatively. The study therefore recommends that monetary authorities should be encouraged to increase money supply as this has similar benefit of increasing private consumption. Furthermore, maintaining a favourable external reserves should be pursued by the monetary authorities.

T2  - International Journal of Academic Research in Business and Social Sciences
AB  - The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between monetary policy instruments and economic growth in Nigeria using annual time series data from 1986 to 2018. Within this broad objective, the specific objectives were to ascertain the relationship between: (1) crude oil price and economic growth; (2) exchange rate and economic growth; (3) inflation rate and economic growth in Nigeria; (4) interest rate and economic growth in Nigeria; and (5) broad money supply and economic growth in Nigeria. Economic growth was proxied by real gross domestic product growth rate. The data were sourced from the publications of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), Statista.com, and the World Bank. The estimation technique was the ordinary least squares (OLS)-based auto-regressive distributed-lag (ARDL) method with the aid of EViews software. The estimated model was evaluated using some diagnostic tests (serial correlation test, normality test, and stability test). The empirical results showed that only interest rate had a positive (0.42) and significant (10%) impact on economic growth in Nigeria in the short run. In the long run, previous gross domestic product and broad money supply had significant impacts on economic growth in Nigeria. The previous gross domestic product had a negative (-0.72) and significant (10%) impact while broad money supply had a negative (-0.000005) and significant (5%) impact on economic growth in Nigeria. In order to effectively use monetary policy instruments in achieving sustainable economic growth, it was recommended that the monetary authority should develop and implement an expansionary monetary policy capable of creating rapid growth of money supply which would lead to a decrease in interest rate which in turn would lead to increase in aggregate investment. These would lead to an increase in economic growth, if properly implemented.

AB  - Purpose The main purpose of this study is to investigate the short-run and long-run asymmetric effects of fiscal policy, namely government spending on economic growth over the sample period 2004Q2 up to 2018Q1 for the South African economy. Design/methodology/approach Nonlinear autoregressive distributive lag model is used to examine the short-run and long-run asymmetric effects of government spending on economic growth. Findings The results exhibit the negative change effect of government spending is found to be greater than the positive change effect of government spending on economic growth. Real effective exchange rate is found to have a positive and significant effect on economic growth both in the short run and long run. Whereas, inflation rate affects economic growth negatively and significantly in the short run and long run. Originality/value Previous empirical studies on the effect of fiscal policy on growth, at least for South Africa, consider only the asymmetric short-run effect while this paper extends the literature by incorporating asymmetries into the long-run effect. It provides a detailed analysis to the recent controversies on the effects of fiscal policy on growth.

AB  - This study examines monetary policy shocks and economic growth in Nigeria. This study following ex post facto research design employed a regression model where economic growth was the dependent variable while money supply, inflation and interest rate were the explanatory variables. Time series data over the period of 1986 to 2018 sourced from Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) Statistical Bulletin and World Bank Development Index (WDI) was utilized. The study employed the Vector Autoregression (VAR) techniques in the analysis. The result of the vector autoregression estimation shows that money supply exert a significant positive effect on economic growth in Nigeria while inflation and interest rate exert an insignificant positive effect on economic growth in Nigeria. The result proves that monetary policy shocks exert a significant effect on economic growth in Nigeria while interest rate and inflation do not show any effect. It was recommended that the CBN should ensure the downward review of the Monetary Policy Rate of 12% to 9 percent so as to enhance more financial accessibility.

In this study, we analyze the effects of monetary policy on economic growth and social welfare in a Schumpeterian growth model with cash-in-advance (CIA) constraints on R&D investment, consumption, and manufacturing. Our main results can be summarized as follows. Under the CIA constraints on R&D and consumption (the CIA constraint on manufacturing), an increase in the nominal interest rate decreases (increases) R&D and economic growth. We also analyze the optimality of Friedman rule and find that Friedman rule can be suboptimal due to a unique feature of the Schumpeterian model.

TI  - Inflation volatility, economic growth and monetary policy in Bangladesh
AU  - Hossain, Akhand Akhtar
T2  - Applied Economics
AB  - This article provides an overview of the trends and movements of CPI-inflation in Bangladesh since the early 1950s and examines the key issues in rule-based monetary policy for price stability, implying low and stable inflation, in this country. Under a fixed exchange rate system, inflation in Bangladesh was moderately high and volatile during the 1950s and 1960s. Since the country’s independence from Pakistan in 1971, inflation in Bangladesh has remained moderately high on average and highly volatile and persistent under a fixed-pegged exchange rate system or under a managed floating system since 2003. Using data from the early 1970s or earlier depending on data availability, the article undertakes both Granger-causality and the structural vector autoregression (SVAR) analysis with two models. The first model is comprised of such variables as inflation, the real interest rate, the real exchange rate and output growth, and the second model is comprised of the volatilities of money growth, real output growth and inflation. Then, based on the empirical findings, the article concludes that a rule-based monetary policy, namely monetary targeting or inflation targeting, remains appropriate for Bangladesh provided that it adopts a more flexible, if not freely floating, exchange rate system. The article suggests that the use of monetary policy to achieve multiple objectives under a fixed-pegged exchange rate system creates a time-inconsistency problem, reduces monetary policy credibility and makes it (monetary policy) ineffective in lowering inflation and its volatility. Low credibility of monetary policy in particular raises inflation persistence. Within the present monetary-policy framework in Bangladesh, the article illustrates how the fixed-pegged exchange rate system has generated money growth volatility in the presence of large-scale inflows of overseas workers’ remittances and readymade garments export earnings. This does not seem to be a concern of the central bank of Bangladesh (Bangladesh Bank); rather, it (Bangladesh Bank) pursues monetary-base targeting to keep inflation low and stable after considering economic growth. The consequent diminishing credibility of monetary policy has kept inflation volatile and persistent, which has adversely affected economic growth.

AB  - This study aims to analyze the relationships between entrepreneurship, innovation and economic growth, and to show the feedback effects in these relationships. A Schumpeterian approach considering three equations linking GDP, innovation, and entrepreneurship facilitates this analysis. This paper presents empirical analysis of entrepreneurial activity in 13 developed countries. Panel data with fixed effects methodology, for the period 2002 to 2007, provides the means to estimate the equations. The analysis shows that several factors have positive impacts on innovation and entrepreneurship, including monetary policy and social climate. Additionally, a feedback effect is at work: economic activity promotes entrepreneurship and innovation activities, and the latter enhances economic activity. Therefore, policymakers must consider this effect when designing economic policies.

AB  - This study examined the impact of monetary policy on economic growth in Nigeria. The secondary data used include the Money supply, economic growth, Credit to the private sector, Interest rate and Exchange rate. The Vector Error Correction model (VECM) was adopted as the estimation technique of the study. Findings show that there is no bidirectional granger causality among any of the variables. Also, one standard deviation shock to M2 initially has positive perceptible effect on Gross Domestic Product (GDP) in the short and also for a long period it still has positive perceptible effect on GDP and causes output to decrease.  One standard deviation shock to Bank Credit to the private sector (BCP) has a huge and negative effect on GDP in the short run and a one standard deviation shock to Interest rate (INT) and Exchange rate (EXC) has positive but low effect on GDP. Therefore, the study recommended that monetary authority- The Central Bank Nigeria (CBN) should manage the money supply properly and work towards eliminating the rigidities associated with credit to the private sector. Monetary policies should be used to create a favorable investment climate by facilitating the emergency of market-based interest rate and exchange rate regimes that attract investments to the Nigerian economy.

AB  - The study examines the impact of monetary policies on economic growth in Sierra Leone using time series data for 1980–2019. Specifically, the study determines how changes in monetary policy transmission through interest rates, reel effective exchange rate, credit to the private sector, and lending rates affect real GDP growth in the country. The relationship between real GDP and monetary policy variables is estimated using the Fully Modified Ordinary Least Square regression. The approach addresses the problem of endogeneity and serial correlation by allowing heterogeneity in the long-run parameter estimates. The diagnostic tests for unit root and cointegration revealed a long-run relationship among the variables, thus indicating a long-run equilibrium relationship. The results from the study show the strength of monetary policy interventions in promoting economic growth in Sierra Leone through real effective exchange rates and monetary sector credit to the private sector. The study also reveals that inflation and interest rate had the expected negative signs but are not effective monetary policy transmission channels. Understanding the effectiveness of how monetary policy channels work in Sierra Leone is critical for policy implementation that enhances output growth.

AB  - Monetary policy as a technique of economic management to bring about sustainable economic growth and development has been the pursuit of many nations. Using annual data over the period 1981 to 2016, this paper examined the impact of monetary policy on the Nigerian economy. In doing this, Augmented Dickey-Fuller unit root test, Vector error correction mechanism (VECM) and the ordinary least squares (OLS) method, were employed to analyze the time series data for the period between 1981 and 2016. The result of the analyses shows that monetary policy represented by money supply exerts a positive impact on GDP growth with negative impact on rate of inflation. The recommendations are that monetary policy should facilitate a favourable investment climate through appropriate interest rates, exchange rate and liquidity management mechanism and the money market should provide more financial instruments that satisfy the requirements of the ever-growing sophistication of operators.

AB  - The Taylor rule (1993) focuses only on two objectives: output and inflation. In practice, the central bank’s loss function (especially in developing countries) contains objectives other than these two, like the interest rates smoothing, exchange rate stabilisation, etc. In this study, the monetary policy reaction function has been estimated. We used the variables as: interest rate as monetary policy reaction function as a dependent variable and exchange rate, money supply and inflation as an independent variables of monetary policy objectives in Pakistan. The main hypothesis of the study is the relationship between the variables of monetary policy objectives in Pakistan using the data for the period 1991-2010 for Pakistan. The econometric framework used in the study is that of VECM. The data was checked for stationarity and was found to be integrated of order one I (1) under the Augmented Dickey-fuller (ADF) test. We found that there is negative impact of exchange rate and positive impact of money supply and inflation on interest rate as monetary policy reaction function.Our results suggest a short-run positive relationship between the variables of monetary policy objectives in Pakistan. There is also found an effectiveness of the variables of monetary policy objectives in Pakistan in the long-run.

AU  - Ltd, ICB-InterConsult Bulgaria
T2  - European Journal of Economics, Law and Politics
AB  - The aim of this study is to examine the relationship between monetary policy and economic growth in which the past studies have shown conflicting results in Nigeria. Data was collected from the Central Bank of Nigeria Statistical Bulletin from 1990 to 2017 and Autoregressive Distributed Lag (ARDL) model and Error Correction Model (ECM) were utilized to address the objective of the study. Consequently, the result of ECM term indicates that about 16% of the total disequilibrium in the previous year due to shock was corrected in the current year. There is a significant negative relationship between exchange rate and economic growth in the short run. Also, there is a significant positive relationship between monetary policy rate and economic growth in the short run. In addition, economic growth and credit reserve ratio have a negative relationship in both short run and long run. Economic growth and inflation rate have a significant positive relationship in both short run and long run. Therefore, this study makes the following recommendations for the policy makers and future researchers in Nigeria: the policy makers in Nigeria should increase the level of broad money supply in the country since both the broad money supply and inflation lead to economic growth in the short run and the long run. Also, the apex bank in Nigeria should embark on the use of appropriate monetary policy variables that will address non-performance of credit requirement ratio, monetary policy rate and exchange rate in contributing to the nation`s economic growth.

AB  - This study analyzes the long-run effects of monetary policy on economic growth and social welfare in a two-country Schumpeterian growth model with cash-in-advance constraints on consumption and R&D investment. We find that an increase in the domestic nominal interest rate decreases domestic R&D investment and the growth rate of domestic technology. Given that economic growth in a country depends on both domestic and foreign technologies, an increase in the foreign nominal interest rate also decreases economic growth in the domestic economy. When each government conducts its monetary policy unilaterally to maximize the welfare of only domestic households, the Nash-equilibrium nominal interest rates are generally higher than the optimal nominal interest rates chosen by cooperative governments who maximize the welfare of both domestic and foreign households. This difference is caused by a cross-country spillover effect of monetary policy arising from trade in intermediate goods. Under the CIA constraint on consumption (R&D investment), a larger market power of firms decreases (increases) the wedge between the Nash-equilibrium and optimal nominal interest rates. We also calibrate the two-country model to data in the Euro Area and the UK and find that the cross-country welfare effects of monetary policy are quantitatively significant.

TI  - Impact of Monetary Policy on Stock Market Development: Implications for the Nigerian Economy
AU  - Nwokoye, Ebele
AU  - Emmanuel, Otu
AB  - The unsustainable and decreasing contribution of the Nigeria stock market to economic growth and development is the rationale for this study. Previous studies were unable to fully address the core developmental problems of the stock market in terms of its contribution to economic growth. These studies focused on how the monetary authorities can stabilize the stock market and reduce its volatility but ignored issues bordering on the contribution of the stock market to economic growth, which of course is the essence of any stock market and as such characterize its development. Consequently, the objective of this study is to investigate the impact of monetary policy on the development of the stock market in Nigeria. The study period covered from 1981 to 2015. Cointegration and vector error correction modelling (VECM) were employed for the analysis. The cointegration test indicates that there exist long run equilibrium relationship among the variables of the model. VECM result indicated that monetary policy, through the growth rate of money supply has impacted positively and significantly on the development of the stock market in Nigeria. Also, findings further indicated that prime lending rate has had a negative impact on the development of the stock market in Nigeria. The study recommended among others, that the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) should use its growth rate of money supply to further boost the development of the stock market but must however be mindful of the channeling of the increase in money supply in order to curtail the possible negative impact of inflation.

TI  - THE EFFECT OF MONETARY POLICY ON ECONOMIC GROWTH IN ASEAN COUNTRIES
AU  - Thangthong, Kanokwan
AB  - This study aims to estimate the effect of monetary policy on economic growth in
ASEAN countries. ASEAN members would be classified into three group according to
their central banks’ objective, consists of inflation targeting group, exchange-rate
targeting group, and mixed targeting group. The data was collected from World Bank,
covers the period from 1996 to 2018. This thesis applies the nonparametric kernel density
model to demonstrate the relationship between monetary policy variables and economic
growth, and using the Bayesian Metropolis-Hastings models to estimate the monetary
effect. Furthermore, this thesis would apply the panel approach (pooled, fixed, and
random effect) to improve the monetary policy model. The empirical result could be
described as follows; the fixed effect model is the most effective method that could
explain the monetary policy effect on economic growth for ASEAN countries. The result
also shows that for inflation targeting group, both inflation and interest rate would
stimulate economic growth, however, the exchange rate would slow down the economic
growth of countries. For exchange-rate targeting group, both inflation and exchange rate
would encourage economic growth. Furthermore, for mixed targeting group, the result
show that the inflation rate and exchange rate have a negative effect on economic growth
while money supply and interest rate would stimulate economic growth. Therefore,
monetary policymakers and investors should be aware of the risk of change in these
central bank objectives, and support their economic growth by keep the aimed estimator
to stay in the reasonable direction.

AB  - This research article focuses on the impact of Monetary Policy on GDP. GDP no doubt is affected by the Monetary Policy of the state. The research papers of various authors have been studied in this regard to prove the Hypothesis and after in depth analysis by applying Regression Analysis technique it has been observed that the relationship between the two exists.  The data from 1999 to March 2013 has been used for driving the conclusion. In doing this, the Ordinary Least Squares Method (OLS) is used to analyze data between 1999 and 2013. The study proved that the Lending interest rate have minor relationship with GDP but the Growth in Money Supply and Nominal exchange rate greatly affects the NGDP of Rwandan  economy, obviously various unknown factors also affects the GDP. Growth in Money Supply has a huge impact on GDP. The effects of stochastic shocks of each of the endogenous variables are explored using Error Correction Model (ECM). The study shows that Long run relationship exists among the variables. Also, the core finding of this study shows that exchange rate, M3 are statistically significant monetary policy instruments that drive economic growth in Rwanda. In short run, the lending rate is not significant variable explaining economic growth in Rwanda .Indeed it is statistically significant in long run, it’s impact on NGDP will be realized after quite 4 quarters.

TI  - Economic Growth, Inflation, and Monetary Policy in Pakistan: Preliminary Empirical Estimates
AU  - Khalid, Ahmed M.
T2  - The Pakistan Development Review
AB  - There is a growing debate in the emerging market on the choice of an appropriate monetary or exchange rate policy that could lead to a sustainable economic growth. Inflation targeting has become one of these policy alternatives and has recently been implemented in some of the emerging markets in Asia and Latin America. Given the recent remarkable economic performance of the Pakistan, this issue has also been discussed at various policy forums in Pakistan. An important pre-condition for the success of inflation-targeting is to identify the leading indicators of inflation and develop a model to reasonably forecast inflation. This is the main objective of this paper. Besides an overview of the experience, the main focus of the paper is to provide some preliminary empirical estimates for inflation equation and its causal relationship with other macroeconomic variables.

AU  - Okoroafor, O. K. David
T2  - International Journal of Applied Economics, Finance and Accounting
AB  - This study tagged influence of monetary indicators on domestic investments and growth of Nigerian economy: 1970-2018, main aim is to ascertain the degree of effects of monetary variables on domestic investment and economic growth. Annual data on the following variables: private domestic investment (PDI), economic growth rate (EGR), narrow money supply (NMS), Commercial bank credit to private Investors (CCP), Commercial bank interest rate (CLR), naira-dollar ratio (NDR) and inflation rate (INR) were extracted from diverse sources. ADF and PP approach as well as ARDL Model were employed for the study. Generally, findings revealed that PDI is influenced positively and significantly at 5% LOS by one period log of PDI and CCP in Nigeria within 1970 and 2018. Also, NMS impacted negatively on domestic investments. It implies that available narrow money supply was utilized majorly by the government sector of the economy with little investment money left for private investors. Results further indicated, that monetary indicators such as NDR, CLR and EGR had no significant influence on domestic investments in the study period. Other findings showed that PDI, NMS and NDR were significant to explained EGR in this period of study. Lagged EGR variable appeared insignificant. Given the results and analysis made, conclusion is drawn that key monetary variables which explained PDI and EGR are mainly money supply and Commercial bank credit. It is therefore recommended that monetary policy moves that would ensure availability of more money and credit to private investors are vigorously pursued.

AB  - This study aims to evaluate monetary policy with measuring its effects on the economic growth in during (2004-2020). To achieve this goal, the study relies on the descriptive and analytical approach using time series data, and by applying the (ARDL) method, and it has reached several conclusions. The most important one is that there is a positive relationship between the money supply (M2) and economic growth. Also, there is a positive but weak relationship between the interest rate and economic growth, while a negative impact through the interest rate on the growth have been found. The study sheds light on the concerns about the instability of the monetary system as a result of fluctuations in oil revenues and the value of the US dollar. Accordingly, it is necessary to enhance the credibility of the Central Bank and conduct the integration and alignment of monetary policy with other economic k to avoid complete dependence on oil ذ policies such as fiscal policy, trade policy and others, and wor revenues.

AB  - For ages, there are controversial debates from the different school of thoughts which focused on the behavior of economic experience incidents. In this paper, we carefully examine and compare the impacts of fiscal policy (government expenditure, current account balance, budget deficit and government debt) versus monetary policy (broad money and real interest rate) on economic growth using dynamic panel threshold regression of Hansen (2000). In particular, the main objectives include (1) to model the threshold effect of budget deficit in stimulating regime dependent switching of variables on economic growth and (2) to compare the impacts of both policies on economic growth between two groups of countries with current account deficit versus current account surplus. The study is based on a panel of two groups of countries for the period of 2005-2014. The results detected a first sample split threshold estimate and found that some of the variables have significance effect on economic growth regardless whether the budget deficit below or upper the threshold level. Comparing both groups of economies; we find one similarity, which both groups of economies show more effective in terms of monetary policy where broad money is able to stimulate higher growth but the fiscal policy through government spending fail to lead to higher GDP growth. Thus, it causes to lower growth in countries with current account deficit. Overall, we can conclude that current account balance has contributed to the large economic growth in countries with current account surplus while government spending has led to significant drop in the economic growth in countries with current account deficit, which indicate the failure or ineffectiveness of the fiscal policy

AB  - One view of government fiscal policy is that it stifles dynamic economic growth through the distortionary effects of taxation and inefficient government spending. Another view is that government plays a central role in economic development by providing public goods and infrastructure. This paper develops a generalized model of fiscal policy and output growth that allows for (i) a positive or negative effect of government spending on private productivity, (ii) increasing or decreasing returns to scale, (iii) a transition path away from the equilibrium growth path, and (iv) intratemporal tax distortions. Using data from 107countries during the period 1970-85,and correcting for the potentially serious problem of endogeneity in government policy, we find that a balanced-budget increase in government spending and taxation is predicted to reduce output growth rates.

AB  - Central America has always seemed to me a particularly fruitful object of study, of economic and particularly monetary affairs, because of the existence of six countries of not too different size and economic structure. This situation provides an opportunity for assessing the workings of certain economic principles.In economic terms, the countries of Central America are very small units. For such units, economics can provide a few analytical propositions that seem prima facie plausible. One is that such economies need not indefinitely specialize in exports of primary products, but if they diversity and industrialize their economies, it must be for export. Industrialization for the domestic market is unlikely to permit sufficient economies of scale. In this regard, the Central American countries have industrialized much less than the small republics in the Far East, and accordingly have not enjoyed as rapid a rate of economic growth.

AB  - This paper examines the impact of monetary policy instruments on the economic development in Nigeria during the period 1980-2006.With the aid of the t-ratio, the study revealed that only two out of the six selected explanatory variables exert a significant impact on the level of economic development in Nigeria between the study periods (pre-and-postderegulation). The study therefore, concludes that with the insignificant nature of most of the variables, policy formulation and implementation inconsistencies appear to hinder the full impact of monetary policy on the economy and therefore, should be critically watched.

T2  - Pakistan Economic and Social Review
AB  - This paper develops a multivariate model to test the effectiveness of monetary and fiscal policy for the economic growth in five Asian Countries (Pakistan, India, Thailand, Indonesia and Malaysia). Most of the previous studies in this area have paid less attention to stationarity, cointegration and causality issues. The series M₁ (Money Stock), Government Expenditure, GDP and exports are tested for time series properties. It is found that the series are non-stationary in their levels but stationary at the difference and hence can be cointegrated. Cointegration analysis shows that long-run relationship exists among the variables. Having established the fact of long-run relationship we further extend our analysis to focus on the causal relationship among the variables. On applying Granger Causality Test two problems were met. One is the choice of optimum lag and second is that the standard Granger or Sims tests results provide invalid causal inferences, as error-correction terms are omitted in these tests. To overcome the issue concerning optimal lag length the minimum final prediction criterion suggested by Hsiao is used, the order in which the variables entered into the model is also considered by using specific gravity criterion (SGC) proposed by Canies and Sethi. This criterion also provides temporary causal inferences between the variables. The second problem is avoided by applying alternative tests for Granger causality based on error correction model. The results show that there exists a strong bi-directional causality between fiscal policy and economic growth and also between monetary policy and economic growth for Thailand. In the case of Indonesia we observed a unidirectional causality between monetary policy and economic growth and a unidirectional causality between fiscal policy and economic growth. Estimation results for Malaysia show only unidirectional causality between the variables representing both of the policies and economic growth. In the case of Pakistan, monetary policy is found to be influencing economic growth. While for India study found out a unidirectional causality between monetary policy and economic growth.

AB  - This paper employs panel smooth transition regression models to investigate the nonlinear effects of two monetary policy proxies (i.e., real exchange rate return and real interest rate differential) on the international reserves—macroeconomic variables nexus. The panel data set includes the fourteen G-20 countries during the period 1991–2012. Empirical results show that the marginal effects of the macroeconomic variables (savings, terms of trade, public debt, capital account liberalization, economic growth, and trade openness) on international reserves are non-linear and vary with time, the proxies and countries, not linear and constant derived from traditional linear model. Currency devaluation policy (against the US dollar) can non-linearly enlarge the positive contribution of trade openness and public debt on international reserves, and non-linearly reduce the negative impact of terms of trade on international reserves, as the Marshall–Lerner condition holds. Expansionary monetary policy (through the decrease in domestic interest rates) can strengthen the positive effects of public debt, trade openness, and economic growth on international reserves. The precautionary and mercantilist views of reserves holdings are partially supported.

AB  - Monetary and fiscal policy are both macroeconomic instruments used to govern and have a large impact on a country's economy, businesses, production and consumption. The objective of the study is to evaluate the comparative analysis of fiscal and monetary policy in Pakistan. For this purpose, an autoregressive distributed lag (ARDL) model was used, which showed the significant impact of monetary and fiscal policy on enhancing economic growth. Data was obtained from World Development Indicator (WDI) from 1990 to 2020. In this study, two models have been estimated using the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) as a dependent variable and Development Expenditures, Gross Fixed Capital Formation, Labor Force Participation, Corruption, Total Tax, Trade openness, Broad Money (M2), Governmental Consumption Expenditure as independent variables. The results showed that monetary policy positively impacts Pakistan’s economy. Also, the study found that fiscal policy affects Pakistan’s economy positively. But the study reveals that monetary policy is more powerful in promoting economic growth in Pakistan. So, we will suggest that promoting the monetary policy in the banking sector would provide a suitable investment atmosphere through the maintenance of inflationary rates, interest rates, and lending rates to endorse and confirm economic growth, sustainability, solidity, and progress in Pakistan.

AB  - This study examined the effectiveness of monetary policy in stimulating economic growth in Nigeria between 1990 and 2019. Secondary data were sourced mainly from CBN publications. The theoretical framework was based on the Keynesian transmission mechanism. In the cause of empirical investigation, various advanced econometric techniques like Augmented Dickey Fuller Unit Root Test, ARDL Bounds Test and Error Correction Mechanism (ECM) were employed and the result revealed that all the variables were stationary at first difference except monetary policy rate that was stationary at level, meaning that the variables were integrated of different order justifying ARDL Bounds Test and error correction mechanism test. The ARDL Bounds Test result indicated that there is a long-run relationship among the variables with the lower bound and upper bound less than the calculated at 5% level of significant. The result of the error correction mechanism (ECM) test indicates an 88% adjustment back to equilibrium. It is therefore recommended that since economic growth in Nigeria is greatly influenced in the long-run by interest rate and reserve requirement making monetary policy an effective tool in stimulating economic growth. Nigerian government through its monetary authorities should unveil other policies that will stimulate economic growth not only in the long run but also, in the short run period

AB  - Using the autoregressive distributed lag (ARDL) bounds testing approach; this paper examines the shortrun and long-run impact of monetary policy on economic growth in Kenya for the period 1973 to 2013. The paper uses both the broad money supply and the 3-month Treasury bill rate as proxies of monetary policy. Both short-run and long-run empirical results support monetary policy neutrality, implying that monetary policy has no effect on economic growth – both in the short run and in the long run. This could be due to the fact that the increasing fiscal deficits funded domestically in Kenya could have weakened the transmission of monetary policy actions into the real economy. The study recommends that policies aimed at improving the institutional and regulatory environment for the financial sector and monetary policy conduct should be pursued in Kenya. There is also a need for improvement in policy coordination, particularly monetary and fiscal policies.

AB  - Simple models in which economic growth is determined by the growth rate of autonomous demand are developed to examine the effects of government spending, deficits, and debt, and of interest-rate changes in the short and long runs. The distribution of income from production is exogenously given and the rate of growth of government expenditure is also given. In the short run, capacity utilization is a variable, but in the long run, capacity utilization is at its exogenously fixed ‘normal’ level. The effects of changes in the rate of growth of government spending and the interest rate on growth and distributional inequality are examined. In the short run, both fiscal and monetary policy expansion increase the rate of growth, but in the long run, while expansionary fiscal policy increases growth, monetary policy does not do so in long-run equilibrium, but only in terms of average rates of growth.

AB  - Цикличность развития экономики и поиск эффективной фискальной и денежно-кредитной политики как инструмента смягчения циклических колебаний будут долгое время оставаться предметом многих профессиональных дискуссий. В частности, кризисные процессы в XXI в. возобновили дебаты между кейнсианцами и сторонниками политики монетаризма. Цель статьи сравнить и оценить различные подходы к эффективному применению инструментов финансовой и денежно-кредитной политик и возможности их практического применения. Многие экономисты пришли к выводу, что осуществление денежно-кредитной политики ведет к более эффективному распределению производственных ресурсов, как в случае фискальной экспансии. Очевидно, что даже в будущем продолжатся споры о том, является ли причиной циклических колебаний неправильная реализация экономической политики или провал экономических и политических институтов.

TI  - THE IMPACT OF MONETARY POLICY ON ECONOMIC GROWTH IN NIGERIA ( 1970-2019)
AU  - Umogun, Daniel Akpofure
AB  - This study analyzed the impact of money supply on economic growth in Nigeria. Specifically, it assessed the impact of money supply on growth, examined the effect
of interest rate on growth , and the impact of exchange rate on Nigeria`s Growth. Annual time series secondary data was used in the study. World Development Indicators (2020, and Penn World Table version 9.0 were used to compile data on real GDP, money supply, level bank reserves , interest rate, inflation, exchange rate and terms of trade. The data was analyzed using econometric methods, namely the Autoregressive Distributed Lag (ARDL) Model. The unit root test, utilizing both the Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) and Phillip and Perron (PP) tests, the lag order of the ARDL models using VAR lag order selection criteria, and the bound test were all carried out. From the results of the study, it was discovered that money supply(MS) has a significant and positive relationship with real GDP in Nigeria. However, interest rate has an insignificant and positive relationship with economic growth while exchange rate was statistically significant and positively related to RGDP in Nigeria. The study concluded that the money supply of Nigeria has been instrumental in aiding economic growth in Nigeria and an increase in the level of money to the various sectors of the economy would increase the level of growth in Nigeria. It is also ascertained that exchange rate is a key indicator for balancing the money value and it also found out high interest rate increases investment, reducing spending or
more money in supply

AU  - Franca, Chinelo
AB  - This study determined the effect of monetary policy on economic growth of Nigeria. The study employed data on prime lending rate, maximum lending rate and inter-bank call rate as monetary policy variables while the gross domestic product at current prices is used as a measure of economic growth. The data is quarterly data from Q1 2010 to Q3 2018 which is currently the maximum available data on quarterly GDP. The multiple linear regression analysis was used to fit the relationship between monetary policy variables and the growth of Nigerian economy. The interest rates are the independent variables while GDP is the dependent variable. The study found that only maximum lending rate has significant effect on economic growth in Nigeria. This study contributes to the divergent results on the effect of monetary policy on economic growth. The current findings lead to the conclusion that the monetary policy has significant effect proxied by the maximum lending rate has significant effect on economic growth. The study therefore recommends that the monetary authority should channel their policies towards improving other interest rates channels for effective monetary policy mechanism.

AB  - Achieving the 2030 sustainable development goals (SDGs) in Nigeria requires sustainable and inclusive economic growth. There is no consensus among economists on the effect of monetary policy on economic growth. The results of previous studies on the effect of monetary policy on economic growth in Nigeria are mixed. The main objective of this paper is to evaluate the effect of monetary policy on economic growth in order to ascertain if monetary policy can be used to achieve SDGs in Nigeria. The effect of monetary policy on economic growth in Nigeria from 1991 to 2020 was evaluated using ordinary least squares regression model. The findings indicated that there is long-run relationship between economic growth and money supply, treasury bill rate and domestic credit provided by banks in Nigeria. The money supply and domestic credit provided by banks had significant positive effect on economic growth; and short-term policy interest rate had significant negative effect on economic growth in Nigeria in line with economic theory. Monetary policy is a veritable tool that can be used to achieve SDGs in Nigeria. Economic growth will increase and SDGs will be achieved in Nigeria if money supply and domestic credit provided by banks are increased and short-term policy interest rate is reduced. Increasing economic growth touches on the objectives of monetary policy of the Central Bank of Nigeria and calls for radical and proactive monetary policy towards achieving SDGs.

AU  - Singleton, Kenneth J.
AB  - How has the Bank of Japan (BOJ) helped shape Japan's economic growth during the past two decades? This book comprehensively explores the relations between financial market liberalization and BOJ policies and examines the ways in which these policies promoted economic growth in the 1980s. The authors argue that the structure of Japan's financial markets, particularly restrictions on money-market transactions and the key role of commercial banks in financing corporate investments, allowed the BOJ to influence Japan's economic success.  The first two chapters provide the most in-depth English-language discussion of the BOJ's operating procedures and policymaker's views about how BOJ actions affect the Japanese business cycle. Chapter three explores the impact of the BOJ's distinctive window guidance policy on corporate investment, while chapter four looks at how monetary policy affects the term structure of interest rates in Japan. The final two chapters examine the overall effect of monetary policy on real aggregate economic activity.  This volume will prove invaluable not only to economists interested in the technical operating procedures of the BOJ, but also to those interested in the Japanese economy and in the operation and outcome of monetary reform in general.

AB  - This paper uses yearly panel data on OECD countries to analyze the relationship between growth and the cyclicality of the budget deficit. We develop new yearly estimates of the countercyclicality of the budget deficit and show that the budget deficit has become increasingly countercyclical in most OECD countries over the past twenty years. However, European Monetary Union (EMU) countries did not become more countercyclical. Using panel specifications with country- and year-fixed effects, we show that: (a) an increase in financial development, a decrease in openness to trade, and the adoption of an inflation-targeting regime move countries toward a more countercyclical budget deficit; (b) a more countercyclical budget deficit has a positive and significant effect on economic growth, and this effect is larger when financial development is lower.

AB  - Economic growth is an emerging concept both in developed and developing countries, when determining many economic indicators specifically increasing standard of living, overcoming poverty, decreasing unemployment level, upholding per-capita income and attaining more foreign investments. Meanwhile, monetary policy instruments can be considered as key player in economic growth (GDP). Therefore, main objective of current study is to investigate the impact of Monetary Policy instruments on Economic Growth (GDP) in Sri Lanka. Through a sound literature review: interest rate, exchange rate and money supply considered as proxy of Monetary Policy instruments. Data were in secondary mode which collected from Central Bank publications for the period of 1985 to 2017 on annual basis. Regression analysis model have been used as main analysis tool with descriptive statistics and correlation analysis while it indicates 99.8% of variation on economic growth by the independent variables. The results of this study are highly in line with established empirical findings as the interest rate and exchange rate have been positively affected on economic growth in Sri Lanka with absence of significant relationship. As it reported money supply indicates a significant and positive impact on economic growth by concluding that money supply is the only one monetary policy instrument which significantly impact for the economic growth in Sri Lanka for last 33 years.

specifically to establish the effects of interest rate and money supply on Economic
growth.
It was based on time series data for the period of 1991-2014 obtained from the
International Financial Statistics (IFS) which was employed for the analysis. Uni-variate
analysis, Correlation matrix for the variables, Augmented Dickey Fuller test for
stationary, Normality tests and finally the model estimation.
7’
The findings revealed that money supply has a positive significance on GDP. However,
interest rate has a negative effect statistically insignificant at 5% level of significance.
That is to say as Money increases also GDP increases, however, increase in interest
rate reduces GDP. This is because investments rely on the rate of interest, High
interest rate makes borrowing expensive to the investor. Thus reduced investments
leads to reduced GDP.
The government should explore rational mechanisms of stimulating increased demand
through money supply since it has emerged as a key element that promotes economic
growth. Secondly the government and the concerned bodies should be in position to
regulate the amount of interest rates charged to the borrowers so as not to scare
borrowers from borrowing a~ it constrains the rate of growth of the economy

For the mentioned analysis data were used for the period 2006-2017. Both government expenditures and broad money supply have a positive and significant impact on economic growth. The impact of trade openness is negative and significant, says the study. The study concludes that the impact on growth is greater than the impact of monetary policy. The authors conclude that the decomposition variance shock in the GDP, in the long run, was not affected much by other variables relative to the short run. Furthermore, as per the Causality test results through the VAR analysis, growth has a double directional causality relationship with broad money growth and government expenditures. One side relationship with the trade openness means trade openness causes the GDP per capital but GDP per Capital does not. Broad money and government expenditures double direction relationship but have no causality relationship with openness.

The working mechanism of the Islamic monetary operation up to its impact on the development of the national economy illustrates the monetary policy transmission carried out by Bank Indonesia. The purpose of this study is to analyze the effects of Bank Indonesia Sharia Certificate (SBIS), Bank Indonesia Sharia Deposit Facility (FASBIS), Sharia Interbank Money Market (PUAS), and aggregate financing on Indonesia's economic growth in the period 2010 to 2020. This research method uses a quantitative approach with the analysis technique Vector Auto Regression (VAR) or Vector Error Correction Model (VECM) to see the long-term impact and shock response on certain variables. Using secondary data on the variables, it is obtained from the Indonesian Economic and Financial Statistics Bank Indonesia (SEKI-BI) and the Central Statistics Agency (BPS) for the period January 2010 to December 2020. This study found that the SBIS variable has a negative relationship with GDP. Meanwhile, the variables FASBIS, PUAS, and aggregate financing have a positive relationship with GDP. For the future, it can be used as input and consideration in policy making that will be determined in optimizing Islamic monetary policy in Indonesia. Further research that will discuss this topic should use Islamic monetary instruments that are more complete than Islamic open market operations and sharia standing facilities. As well as comparing with conventional monetary operation instruments as a comparison for Islamic monetary.

AB  - La croissance du rendement et de l'emploi au Canada dans les années 1990 n'a pas atteint le niveau qu'elle avait au cours des précédentes décennies, ni celui des Etats-Unis. Une évaluation des "Règles de la Politique Monétaire" pour chacun de ces pays illustre les différences importantes qui existent dans ce domaine entre le Canada et les Etats-Unis. Au début des années 1990, la politique monétaire canadienne mettait l'accent, en priorité, sur une nette réduction de l'inflation, ce qui ne donna que de médiocres résultats. Les Etats-Unis ont eu une politique monétaire établissant un équilibre entre le contrôle de l'inflation et la stabilisation du rendement, ce qui donna d'excellents résultats. Ces constatations plaident en faveur d'une politique monétaire canadienne, pour l'avenir, capable d'étayer une croissance stable du rendement et des taux d'inflation cibles et qui ne se limite pas à la réduction de l'inflation et aux cibles visées. /// Growth in output and employment in Canada in the 1990s did not match that of earlier decades, or that in the United States. "Monetary policy rules" estimated for each country illustrate important policy differences between Canada and the United States. In the early 1990s Canadian monetary policy placed primary emphasis on a sharp reduction in inflation and performance was weak. United States' monetary policy balanced inflation control and output stabilization, and performance was strong. These findings argue for future Canadian monetary policy that provides support for stable output growth and inflation targets, not just inflation reduction and targets.

AU  - Siami-Namini, Sima

T2  - Journal of Economic Studies
AB  - Purpose The purpose of this paper is to explore the effect of growth in different sectors of the economy of developing countries on income inequality and analyze how inflation, as a proxy for monetary policy, makes a proportionate contribution for setting a binding national target for reducing income inequality. The paper examines the existence of a linear or nonlinear effect of inflation and sectoral economic growth on income inequality using a balanced panel data of 92 developing countries for the period of 1990–2014. Design/methodology/approach Methods section includes several steps as below: first, the functional form of the model using panel data for investigating the contribution of economic sectors in income inequality; second, to estimate the relationship between income inequality and sector growth: testing the Kuznets hypothesis; third, to estimate the relationship between inflation and income inequality base on general functional form of the model proposed by Amornthum (2004); fourth, a panel Granger causality analysis based on a VECM approach. Findings The statistically significant finding shows that first agricultural growth and then industrial growth have a dominate impact in reducing income inequality in our sample. But, the service sector growth has positive effects. The results confirm the existence of Kuznets inverted “U” hypothesis for industry growth and Kuznets “U” hypothesis for service sector growth. The findings show that sector growth and inflation affect income inequality in the long-run. Originality/value This research is an original paper which analyzes the effect of growth in different sectors of the economy of developing countries (agriculture, manufacturing and services sectors) on income inequality and test the Kuznets hypothesis in terms of sector growth and at the same time, examine the existence of a linear/nonlinear effect of inflation and sectoral economic growth on income inequality and test Granger causality relationship between income inequality and sector growth and inflation.

AU  - Vickers, John
AB  - This paper discusses possible links between monetary arrangements in particular monetary union and economic growth. It is stressed that growth depends ultimately on how the real economy works: there is no monetary magic that can conjure up growth. But monetary policy can contribute to conditions for sustainable growth by securing and maintaining price stability; monetary union might extend this. It might also deepen the single market. The elimination of nominal exchange rate movement among members of the union removes some sources of shock but also some ways of adjusting to shocks. This underlines the importance of other adjustment mechanism especially supply-side flexibility, which is crucial for growth in any event.

TI  - Impact Of Monetary Policy on Bank loan - A Case study of Mercantile Bank
AU  - Hasem, Sumaiya
AB  - The implication of a range of factors on the bank's credit channel of the monetary policy transmission was investigated in this study. One of the most important tools that the government uses to manage the economy is monetary policy. As little more than a result, understanding the trends in the area is a critical topic in economic research. Since the 1990s, Bangladesh's monetary policy objectives, and also the instruments and operational mechanisms for implementing them, have started to experience substantial improvements, have included those of other governments throughout the world. Even though maintaining economic stability (inflation) and stimulating economic growth have traditionally been recognized as essential requirements of the Bangladesh Bank's (BB) monetary policy, consecutive economic downturns in the global economy have changed dramatically Bangladesh's conventional monetary policy strategy. The conclusions of this research which was based on yearly data from the Mercantile Bank’s loan Department (2017-202) and Bangladesh’s monetary policy statement (2017-2021) shows that the lending is affected by changes in the interest rates of the quantitative measures of monetary policy. This research, on the other hand, shows how the loan channel works inside the market system. The impact of monetary policy on bank lending is influenced by the market power. For the banking industry, the findings have significant policy consequences. Although more competition grows angst about economic stability, more market power has a negative relationship with the bank lending and monetary policy transmission in these scenarios. Such findings might support counter banking strategies as a method of accomplishing the intended monetary policy aim. As a result, credit market inefficiencies in our model only account for a small amount of amplification and propagation of genuine monetary policy shocks.

TI  - Evaluating the Relative Impact of Monetary and Fiscal Policy in Nigeria using the St. Louis Equation
AU  - Ltd, ICB-InterConsult Bulgaria
T2  - Acta Universitatis Danubius. Œconomica
AB  - The controversy existing on the efficacy of monetary and fiscal policy to influence the economy is unending. This study evaluates the relative impact of monetary and fiscal policy in Nigeria from 1986 to 2014 using a modified St. Louis equation. Employing the Ordinary Least Squares estimation method, this study reveals that growth in money supply and export have a positive and significant effect on growth in output of the economy while growth in government expenditure has a negative and insignificant effect. This study provides evidence that monetary policy has a greater growth-stimulating effect on the economy than fiscal policy. It recommends that monetary policy rather than fiscal policy should be relied upon by the Nigerian government as an economic stabilisation tool.

TI  - Monetary volatility and the dynamics of economic growth: An empirical analysis of an oil‐based economy, 1970–2018 - Algaeed - OPEC Energy Review - Wiley Online Library
AB  - Over the past decades, and since the first development plan in 1970, Saudi Arabia has controlled the stability of its economy through prudent fiscal policy and tight monetary policy. This study examines the impact of monetary volatility on real gross domestic product (GDP) growth in an oil-based economy from 1970 to 2018, using the Hodrick–Prescott filtering approach. Although standard methods such as GARCH are used to test volatility, the uniqueness of this study is that it tests the volatility of monetary policy using ordinary least squares (OLS), autoregressive distributed lag (ARDL) and IRF methods. We find that the standard deviation of the broad money supply and the real interest rate business cycle tends to have a negative impact on real growth in the short and long run, supporting the proposition that a high interest rate negatively affects real growth. We also document that the standard deviation of the real exchange rate business cycle has a positive (negative) effect on real growth in the short and long run and is not statistically significant. This suggests that the volatility of the real exchange rate does not affect real growth. Moreover, the magnitude of the volatility of the coefficients is lower in the long run than in the short run. To achieve sustainable economic growth, policy makers need to plan how to manage the volatility of the money supply and the interest rate in the short run and develop long-run strategies to manage volatility in the long run. To control monetary volatility, policymakers should also control government spending by dampening the volatility of oil prices, which ultimately affect the money supply and thus stable economic growth.

AB  - In this article, we examine the impact of financial market development on the level of economic development. In particular, we explore this issue in a setting where individuals face idiosyncratic risk. Incomplete information also provides a transaction role for money so that monetary policy can be studied. While an active banking sector promotes risk sharing, we incorporate a market for equity by allowing individuals to trade capital across generations. In this manner, each asset and financial market in our model fulfills a distinct economic function. Consistent with recent empirical work, we find that the impact of access to a stock market may be indeterminate?the economy may respond with significant gains in capital accumulation and risk sharing, or there may be relatively little impact. We also show that the effects of monetary policy vary across the level of financial development. In economies with small stock markets, increasing the amount of liquidity will cause capital accumulation to decline. By comparison, in advanced economies, capital accumulation improves.

T2  - European Economic Review
AB  - This study develops a Schumpeterian growth model with endogenous entry of heterogeneous firms to analyze the effects of monetary policy on economic growth via a cash-in-advance constraint on R&D investment. Our results can be summarized as follows. In the special case of a zero entry cost, an increase in the nominal interest rate decreases R&D, the arrival rate of innovations and economic growth as in previous studies. However, in the general case of a positive entry cost, an increase in the nominal interest rate affects the distribution of innovations that are implemented and would have an inverted-U effect on economic growth if the entry cost is sufficiently large. We also calibrate the model to aggregate data of the US economy and find that the growth-maximizing inflation rate is about 3%, which is consistent with recent empirical estimates. Finally, we also explore the welfare effects of inflation and consider a number of extensions to the benchmark model.

AB  - Facing the current complicated situation of the COVID-19 pandemic, in addition to medical efforts on disease prevention and treatment, governments of countries also have to come up with solutions to deal with the negative impacts of the pandemic on the economy. This study aims to provide specific, comprehensive, and scientific estimates of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the Vietnamese economy. By using the Bayesian method to estimate DSGE models, research results show that a shock increase by one standard deviation (about 1.49% increase in the probability of a COVID-19 outbreak) to the Covid status variable immediately reduces the output gap by 0.94%. However, this effect only lasts for one quarter, and the output gap widens again. Meanwhile, refinancing interest rates, inflation, and exchange rate changes also have an immediate decline in response to this shock, but the magnitude of the reduction is relatively small.

AU  - Kamar, Bassem
AU  - Soto, Raimundo
AB  - The aim of this paper is to explore and quantify the role of monetary policy on economic
performance in resource-based economies, with a particular focus on Middle East economies.
We consider two dimensions of performance: long-run economic growth and price instability
(inflation). At the international level, there is mixed evidence regarding the long-run growth
record of resource-abundant economies. In some countries, natural resources have turned into
a curse of protracted inefficiency, low economic growth and perpetual instability. In other
economies, natural resources have played an important role in fostering stability and sustained
economic growth. Furthermore, resource rich economies tend to suffer from higher and more
unstable levels of price inflation; nevertheless, this malaise is less pronounced in oil exporters.
A crucial component in our study is to assess the role of exchange rate regimes and their
interplay with monetary and fiscal policies.

AB  - Economic growth, low inflation, and financial stability are among the most important goals of policy makers, and central banks such as the Federal Reserve are key institutions for achieving these goals. In Asset Prices and Monetary Policy, leading scholars and practitioners probe the interaction of central banks, asset markets, and the general economy to forge a new understanding of the challenges facing policy makers as they manage an increasingly complex economic system.  The contributors examine how central bankers determine their policy prescriptions with reference to the fluctuating housing market, the balance of debt and credit, changing beliefs of investors, the level of commodity prices, and other factors. At a time when the public has never been more involved in stocks, retirement funds, and real estate investment, this insightful book will be useful to all those concerned with the current state of the economy.

AB  - The study investigated the effects of monetary policy dynamics on the economic growth of the SSA using data from thirty seven Sub Saharan African Countries. Dynamic panel data technique is used to estimate the model which described the relationship between SSA economic growth and monetary policy variables. However, macroeconomic variables such as exchange rate, inflation rate among others are included in the estimated dynamic panel model. The results show that the monetary policy rates failed to lead to sustainable growth in the SSA because of the limited effects it has in boosting domestic output. This reason is evident in the fact that the expected effect of expansionary monetary policy is limited due to weak financial deepening that is rampant in many Sub Saharan African Countries. Monetary policy approach that will not only be expansionary but exert required financial deepening that will have significant effect on the real domestic activities in the SSA should be encouraged.
