AU  - Nguyen, Hoang Chung
T2  - The Journal of Asian Finance, Economics and Business(JAFEB)
AB  - The study estimates the Structured VAR and the Dynamic Stochastic General Equilibrium Model for the Vietnamese economy based on the new Keynesian model for small and open economies, with the output gap, inflation, policy interest rate, the Vietnamese exchange rate, and the inflation and interest rate in the United States. The paper aims to clarify the impulse response of the macro variables through their shocks. It offers to model the SVAR and DSGE processes, as well as describe why and how interest rate policy is important in the impulse response of macro variables like the output gap and inflation process. The study supports the central role of monetary policy by giving empirical evidence for the new Keynesian theory, according to which an interest rate shock causes the output gap to widen and inflation to decrease. Finally, the application of the DSGE model is becoming more and more popular in the State Bank of Viet Nam to improve its policy planning, analyzing, and forecasting policy towards sustainable and stable growth.

AB  - The article deals with international experience and methods of central banks that contributed to the economic development of their countries. The author provides an analysis of principles and results of the current monetary policy of the National Bank of Ukraine in the context of the opportunities for monetary support of economic recovery. It is shown that the peculiarities of modern monetary policy in Ukraine and in particular the qualitative change in the nature of the hryvnia's emission led to decreased amount of real money in the economy, slower lending, lower confidence and growing inflation expectations. To analyze the stabilization function of monetary policy, the author estimates potential GDP (trend 1993-2014), obtained with Hodrika - Prescott filter by separating the trend and cyclical components. To assess the impact of the changes in the real money supply on real GDP rate, the author carried out model based calculations, which, based on elasticity coefficient, made it possible to obtain estimates of GDP in 2015. The article justifies the necessity of adjustment of the current policy and identifies various guidelines, which, within the implementation of inflation targeting, would not raise the price dynamics but rather support economic growth.

AB  - This paper provides the first investigation of the exogenous monetary shocks’ impact on the IPO market by using a high-frequency identification strategy. Contractionary shocks in the conventional sense trigger a decline in IPO activity. In contrast, contractionary shocks that convey positive economic information trigger a rise in IPO activity. Separating conventional monetary shocks from central bank information shocks allows a richer assessment of the monetary policy’s influence on the IPO market.

TI  - Impact of Inflation and Monetary Policy Stabilization on Economic Growth Performance In Nigeria
AU  - Taiwo, Muritala
AB  - Generally, both fiscal and monetary policies seek at achieving relative macroeconomic stability through maintaining stable prices or low and stable inflation. In the light of this, this study empirically investigates the impact of inflation and monetary policy on economic growth performance in Nigeria with the use of econometric technique - O L S method using time series data from CBN statistical bulletin from 1981-2008. The results revealed that although money supply is positively related to economic growth performance, but the result is however insignificant in the case of GDP growth rates on the choice of inflation rate has no significant impact on economic growth performance. This study reveals that monetary policy alone is incapable of controlling inflation. It should therefore be supplemented by fiscal measures, non monetary and non fiscal measures. Fiscal measures are highly effective for controlling government expenditure, personal consumption expenditure, and private & public investment. The study therefore recommends that the Central Bank of Nigeria needs to deal with monetary policy in a more transparent manner so as to address the issues of expectations as inflation exhibits a high degree of inertia.

TI  - The unconventional monetary policy of the European Central Bank: Effectiveness and transmission analysis
AU  - Zabala, Jose A.
AU  - Prats, Maria A.
T2  - The World Economy
AB  - Since the beginning of the financial crisis in summer 2007, the European Central Bank (ECB) has redirected traditional monetary policy, based on interest rates, to an unconventional monetary policy focused on the quantitative expansion of its balance sheet. In this context, the present paper aims to assess the effectiveness of unconventional monetary policy instruments with regard to inflation and economic growth. To this end, the methodology is based on the estimation of a structural vector autoregressive model for the period 2007:Q1–2018:Q4, using four variables: EONIA, the total amount of assets on the ECB's balance sheet, the Eurozone inflation rate and the Eurozone economic growth rate. The results show a slight impact of the different balance sheet policies on inflation and economic activity behaviour, especially during the last year of the financial crisis. The robustness of these results is supported by the estimation of the same model replacing EONIA rates with shadow rates. Therefore, the results support the existence of monetary transmission for the period during which the unconventional monetary policy was developed as well as the effectiveness of the monetary policy adopted by the ECB in its commitment to price stability.

AB  - The study presents the monetary policy indicators and the measures of economic growth in the Philippines for the past 30 years. It determines the role of the selected macroeconomic indicators on the economic growth in the country through the analysis of the functional relationship of monetary policy indicators on gross domestic product and finally determine the causality among macroeconomic indicators. The descriptive result showed that there has been an unstable fluctuation in some of the macroeconomic variables from 1986 to 2017. The study concludes that there is a significant relationship between money supply, inflation rate and economic output (GDP). It is therefore observed that money supply and inflation cause the fluctuation in gross domestic product but not vice versa. An increased in inflation rate may lead to lower gross domestic product but a higher money supply leads to a higher gross domestic product. On the contrary there is no significant long run relationship observed among variables. The study further concludes that the relationship between variables is unidirectional.

AB  - The aim of the present article is to conduct the considerations aiming at the identification and presentation of the role of financial inclusion in realization of main purposes of monetary policy—financial stability and economic growth. To achieve the aim of the paper, the reviewed articles and reports of international organizations as well as the case studies from many countries will be used. Financial inclusion is strongly connected with many other financial parameters and processes and influences the financial well-being of households, financial management in enterprises, financial stability and economy as a whole. This impact—although it is ambiguous—accompanies the monetary policy of central banks. Financial inclusion may both increase as well as decrease the efficiency of usage the different tools and channels of central bank’s monetary policy in achieving the most important purposes—financial stability and economic growth. This means that many activities carried out to increase the level of financial inclusion may turn out to be risky. Complex relationships of many financial categories and processes, including financial inclusion and monetary policy require the detailed analysis to develop their coherent policy. A consideration of the financial inclusion as supporting process to monetary policy implies further research on ways of increasing the level of financial inclusion, taking into account multifaceted and bidirectional as well as direct and indirect relations between financial inclusion and monetary policy. The article presents integrated attitude to the influence of the financial inclusion on financial stability and economic growth.

This research intend to investigate short and long run effects of export and monetary policy on GDP among listed manufacturing firms of Pakistan. The cointegration analysis is used after estimating data stationarity. The time series data (from 1998 to 2020) was collected for exports, exchange rate, interest rate and GDP. The study outcomes reveal that in short-run there is no effect of export, exchange rate, interest rate on GDP of listed manufacturing firms of Pakistan. However, interest rate, exports and exchange rate have long run effect on GDP of listed firms. The results are crucial for economic policy makers in searching suitable products to be exported that maintains the GDP.

AB  - The purpose of this paper is to conduct a comparative analysis of monetization as a priority of the new monetary growth of the economies using the example of the Russian economy, identifying new trends in global practices of monetary factor management, as well as the search for ways to stimulate economic growth using the best international experience. Our paper tackles the novel research question of whether changing the priorities of monetary policy from targeting (and curbing) inflation to stimulating economic growth might yield more favorable economic results and what best world practices should be appropriately introduced in Russia to improve the effectiveness of monetary policy. The key results of the paper are focused on a comparative analysis of the economies’ development under the influence of monetary factors in comparison with the most progressive economies, the study of the best practices for increasing the monetization of national economies, and the identification of recommendations for determining the most optimal way to increase economic growth through the monetization of the economy. Monetarist views on the decisive role of fiat money in the development of the real sector of the economy, capital markets, payment and settlement systems, the standard of living of the population, and other important aspects of macro- and microeconomics have become the mainstream of government regulation. It seemed that by finding the right indicators of the relationship between interest rates, GDP, and inflation, all problems of economic growth could be solved. By increasing the amount of money faster than the achieved economic growth, it was believed that it was possible to stimulate GDP growth through monetary investments and credit, i.e., more money was issued than the value produced represented by the goods and services. Accordingly, new money that had no value had to create new value. We argue that monetization can be seen as the main factor in providing such incentives. Our results can be useful for central bankers, policymakers, and stakeholders in the banking and financial sector. The conclusions and recommendations of the authors are based on studies conducted using such research methods as content analysis, logical analysis, and statistical analysis.

In this paper, we used the Autoregressive Distributed Lag bound testing estimation techniques to examine the existence of any relationship between monetary policy instruments and the stock market in Nigeria based on the data sourced from 1985 to 2013. From the results obtained, it can be deduced that monetary policy instruments significantly exerts on stock market behaviour in Nigeria. We recommends that policy makers should put in place policies that aimed at adjusting the interest rate upward, reduce or at best keep at constant the money supply growth rate, increase the net credit to the private sector and manipulate the exchange rate regime so as to boost stock market.

TI  - An analysis of monetary policy and its effect on inflation and economic growth in South Africa
AU  - Van Wyngaard, D.
AB  - Emerging market economies, such as South Africa, frequently struggle to maintain a stable and economically viable inflation rate due to economic factors of a cost-push and structural nature. These factors not only influence inflation within the economy, but also the efficacy of monetary policy in its pursuit of its many goals. The South African economy has thus long been a victim of volatile inflation, low growth and low employment creation, which are all matters that form part of the mandate of monetary policy. This could be because of the indirect measures that have been used by the South African Reserve Bank (SARB) to control both money supply as well as inflation in the economy have become increasingly inefficient over time. Therefore, the primary objective of the study was to analyse the efficiency of monetary policy in South Africa, in terms of reaching its goals as set out by the mandate of the SARB regarding inflation, employment and economic growth and in having done so, investigating the existence of cost-push and structural inflationary factors within the South African economy. This study examined the effects of official interest rate, broad money supply, the exchange rate, government debt and government revenue on CPI inflation, as well as on the efficiency of
monetary policy in reaching its objectives. It thus determines the long- and short-run relationships
between the aforementioned variables from 2001 to 2017. The study further establishes the causal
direction between the variables under study. Therefore, the study employed various econometric
models inclusive of the Autoregressive Distributed Lag (ARDL) model, the standard ARDL bounds test to cointegration, the Error Correction Model and Toda-Yamamoto granger noncausality test. Furthermore, the study made use of a quantitative research design and included time series, macro-economic variables such as gross domestic product, employment, the repo rate, broad money supply, the nominal effective exchange rate, government debt, government revenue and consumer price inflation, quarterly from 2001 to 2017. These variables were used in two separate econometric models, one of which had consumer price inflation as its dependent variable, with all other variables as independent. The other combined gross domestic product, employment, consumer price inflation to create the Monetary Policy Success Index or MPSI. By employing the unit root and stationarity tests, the study found that all the variables under study comprised of variables that are stationary at either I(0) or I(1), with none of the variables stationary at I(2). This allowed the ARDL model to be used, which produced results that indicated that the South African economy is consistent with cost-push and structural inflation, which leads to inefficiency in the achievement of the objectives of monetary policy as it takes roughly 5.34 quarters for changes in monetary policy to affect the economy. Both long- and short-run
relationships exist between independent and dependent variables. The study further performed the
Toda-Yamamoto Granger non-causality test and found that variables such as government revenue
and government debt have a short-run impact on consumer price inflation, supporting the existence
of structural and cost-push inflation in the South African economy. Equally as important, the results of the residual and stability diagnostic tests, which were performed on both models of the study proved that the study models are normally distributed, none are serially correlated nor heteroscedastic and are both stable. This, in turn, ensured that the results of the study are not inaccurate or misleading.

TI  - THE IMPACT OF MONETARY POLICY ON THE ECONOMIC GROWTH IN NIGERIA. (1986-2013)
AU  - Olumide Emmanuel, Awoniyi
AU  - Y. O., Adegoke
AB  - ABSTRACT
Distortion of price has been a major bottleneck to the attainment of growth in developing
countries. Monetary policy serves as the macroeconomic tool used to combat and alter the
negative outcomes in order to maintain viability and balance in the economy. However, the
dissatisfaction of the actual outcome in relation to the targeted outcome has led to the
discussion on the roles and effects of monetary policy on the economy in terms of growth. The
study investigated the impact of monetary policy on economic growth in Nigeria.
The research utilized data gathered from the World Bank and various statistical bulletins
and annual reports from the Central Bank of Nigeria for the period 1986-2013. The Cointegration
method is employed in the analysis of the data gathered with the aid of E-Views
on the model consisting of exchange rate, interest rate, broad money supply and inflation as
the exogenous variable while Gross Domestic Product is the endogenous variables.
The findings indicate that monetary policy instrument (exchange rate) has a positive
impact on the Gross Domestic Product by playing a crucial role in the increase in
productivity for the 29 years span period and inflation, broad money supply, interest rate
have negative impact on Gross Domestic Product.
The study recommends that the monetary policy authorities and other financial regulatory
body have to come up with possible solution that can help in addressing the long time
negative influence of inflation, broad money supply and interest rate on economic growth.
They must also ensure that the stability of the exchange rate is protected in order to ensure
steady growth in the economy.

AB  - This study investigated the asymmetric effects of financial instability shocks on economic growth and monetary policy shocks on financial instability in Iran. For this purpose,data 1991:3 to 2017:1 and nonlinear auto-regressive distributed lag (NARDL) approach has been used. For this purpose, three models have been estimated. In the first model, the asymmetric effects of fiscal instability shocks on economic growth are studied and in the next two models, the asymmetric effects of monetary policy shocks are investigated. The results of the first model indicate positive financial instability shock has a negative effect and negative shock has a positive effect on economic growth. Also, in the second model, the results indicate that a positive interest rate shock has a negative effect and a negative interest rate shock has a positive effect on financial instability. The results of the third model estimate indicate that a positive Liquidity growth shock has a positive effect and a negative Liquidity growth shock has a negative effect on financial instability. The results of the effect of government spending on financial instability in the second and third models are different due to the application of different monetary policy tools in the two models, Therefore, it can be said that the effect of government spending on financial instability can vary depending on the type of monetary policy. The results of the Wald test show that the effects of financial instability shocks on economic growth and the effects of monetary policy shocks on financial instability in the short run and long run is asymmetrical. Also, the effect of Liquidity growth on financial instability is asymmetric in the short run but symmetric in the long run.

TI  - Impact of Monetary Policy on Economic Instability in Turkey (1983 - 2003)
AU  - Feridun, Mete
T2  - Prague Economic Papers
AB  - This article aims at revealing the effectiveness of Turkish monetary policy in controlling inflation rate and the stability of exchange rate using the rational expectation framework that incorporates the fiscal role of exchange rate. Based on quarterly data covering the period between 1983: Q4 and 2003: Q4, the analysis affirms that the effort of the Turkish monetary policy at influencing the finance of government fiscal deficit through the determination of the inflation-tax rate, to some extent, affects both the rate of inflation and the real exchange rate, thereby causing volatility in their rates. Moderate evidence emerges that inflation affects volatility of its own rate as well as the rate of real exchange.

AB  - This article examines the main integration trends of the state's monetary and fiscal policy in influencing economic growth and maintaining the sustainability of public debt. It is argued that the relationship between these trends of macroeconomic regulation is predetermined, on the one hand, by the potentially negative impact of fiscal expansion from the point of view of inflation, and by the negative impact of a likely state default in failing to refinance the debt from the Ministry of Finance, on the other hand.
The paper studies the selected array of statistical data using the fiscal policy multipliers concept, the relationship between the effect of increase/decrease in budget expenditures, the slowdown in economic activity and the efforts by the Central Bank to offset fiscal measures, on the one hand, and the ratio of an increase/decrease in budget revenues and debt expenditures used to finance the budget investments, on the other hand.
It is revealed that the investments are effective if implementing budget expenditures in the presence of the GDP gap and unrealized expectations of economic agents, while reducing spending in such a situation will intensify the recession. The GDP growth determined by these investments should provide the tax effect sufficient to cover the expenses. Otherwise, there can be negative effects of debt that establishes the need for measures to refinance public debt by the Central Bank.
The conclusions of the paper can be used to assess the possible integration of monetary and fiscal policy based on various states.

TI  - Bank lending behaviour and economic growth: an empirical analysis with implication for monetary policy formulation in Nigeria
AU  - Nnanna, O.
T2  - Economic and Financial Review
AB  - Preliminary findings from the empirical analysis show that the banking sector has not supported real sector output growth in its lending policy. The combined effects of risk aversion and infrastructural problem in the real sector represent serious constraints on credit flow to the private sector and the sectors declining marginal product of capital. Overall, while the banking sector has indeed, succeeded in deposit mobilization, it has nevertheless, not done a good job in its intermediation functions. The analysis further reveals the presence of policy distortions in the system, and its negative influence on banks' lending behaviour. The need to address these distortions cannot be overemphasized if banks are to resume their traditional role of economic development in Nigeria.

TI  - Essays on Monetary Policy and Economic Growth
AU  - OH, EUN
AB  - This thesis consists of three essays concerning money supply growth, one of the main objectives in monetary policy, and economic growth. The aim of this work is to investigate the role of money in monetary policy and how money supply and seigniorage impact on output growth. The findings are derived from theoretical models and modern econometric techniques. 

First of all, I shall evaluate the role of money in the conduct of monetary policy in South Korea. This research analyses the effect of monetary aggregates on prices and output and examines its transmission mechanism using recursive and non-recursive vector autoregressive models. The expansionary monetary policy shocks have substantial effects on output. Specific channels of the transmission operate through the effects which monetary aggregates have on banking lending, stock prices, exchange rates and investment, export, and government consumption. 

Then, a cash-in-advanced model and human capital based endogenous growth model is developed. Through employing Bayesian maximum likelihood estimation, a positive money shock is created leading to an increase in seigniorage, which also has a positive impact on output growth. This is because there is a growth-enhancing effect from human capital production since seigniorage is spent by a government on public education. I shall show that money within the model also generates a connection between seigniorage and inflation. 

However, in the long run, the theoretical model also captures the adverse effect of seigniorage due to inflation so that I shall examine the existence of threshold effects between seigniorage and growth in developing countries using Hansen (1999)’s panel threshold methodology. The threshold level of seigniorage above which seigniorage significantly slows output growth is set at 2.27%. 

This thesis confirms that money supply and seigniorage have a substantial impact on output so that money is an important factor to be considered in the architecture of macroeconomic policy.

AB  - This study investigates the Effectiveness of Monetary policy in achieving Economic Growth: The case of Nigeria for the period 1980-2009. Monetary policy has become a major tool in economic management in Nigeria because of the dominance of the financial sector in its economic activities. This study employed the Ordinary Least square method in carrying out the research. From the various test carried out it was find out that monetary policy rate (MPR) (formerly minimum rediscount rate (MRR)),exchange rate and treasury bill investment have negative impact on GDP. Also it is seen that during the period under review that the manipulation of monetary policy instruments have not proven to be effective in achieving economic growth. It is therefore recommended that the monetary authorities should strengthen the working mechanism of the monetary policy instruments to ensure their success in helping to achieve the desired macroeconomic growth. In addition the policy instrument should be a well coordinated optimal mix of instruments.

AB  - This paper investigates the asymmetric effects of monetary policy on economic growth over business cycles in Iran. Estimating the models using the Hamilton (1989) Markov-switching model and by employing the data for 1960-2012, the results well identify two regimes characterized as expansion and recession. Moreover, the results show that an expansionary monetary policy has a positive and statistically significant effect on economic growth during recession, in expansionary regimes while the effects are stronger during recessions than expansions as predicted by finance constraints models. By using time-varying transition probability Markov-switching models, the results also show that an expansionary monetary policy raises the probability of switching from a recession to an expansion but reduces the probability of switching from an expansion to a recession.

AB  - The purpose of monetary policy as a strategy of economic management is to achieve long-term economic growth and development. As noted by Onyewu (2012), this was the chase of states and the formal illustration of how money effects economic numbers. This viewpoint extends back to Adam Smith's time and was later supported by monetary economists. Since describing the function of monetary policy in impacting macroeconomic goals such as economic growth and development, including job creation, price stability, GDP growth, balance of payments balance, and a variety of other monetary authorities. It is primarily responsible for utilizing monetary policy to design and implement strategies aimed at bringing the economy back into balance. Furthermore, monetary policy is not the only factor affecting GDP, employment, and prices. Many additional factors influence aggregate demand and supply, and hence the economic position of sectors of the economy. Some of these factors, such as shifts in economic growth, creditor positions, environmental catastrophes, disruptions in the oil market that reduce supply, agricultural losses, and slowdowns in productivity growth, can be expected and integrated into spending and other economic decisions. They are absolutely unexpected and have an unforeseen impact on the economy.

The objective of this study is to discover the ways by which fiscal and monetary policies can be established to boost economic growth, highlight present Pakistan fiscal and monetary challenges to discover regions which may yield upgrading to the fiscal and monetary framework and consequently increase employment opportunities and the budget revenues in Pakistan. The augmented Dickey Fuller unit root procedure is used to check the time series properties. The Autoregressive Distributed Lag Model technique is used to find the long-run relationship between fiscal /monetary policy and economic growth. The results show that monetary and fiscal policies both play a significant role in the economic growth of Pakistan. The relationship between GDP and Government Current Expenditure (GCE) is found to be negative while, Currency in Circulation (CIR) and Government Development Expenditure (GDE) affect GDP positively in case of Pakistan.

Nowadays, socially inclusive and environmentally sustainable economic growth is a central priority of public policy for most governments worldwide. Based on the theoretical and conceptual frameworks of inclusive growth and sustainable growth, we focus on monetary policy as a powerful macroeconomic policy tool connected with distributional and environmental issues. We deal with how high levels in income and wealth inequality, on the one hand, and shocks related to environmental degradation and climate change, on the other hand, it might have substantial implications for the conduct of monetary policy. We also contribute to the ongoing debate on rethinking monetary policy in terms of intra- and inter-generational equity by assessing the extent to which central banks could actively contribute to reducing economic inequalities and environmental unsustainability and internalize these challenges in their policy objectives and actions.

AU  - Ryan-Collins, Josh
AU  - van Lerven, Frank
AB  - In the face of the perceived high public and private debt levels and sluggish recovery that has followed the financial crisis of 2007-08, there have been calls for greater fiscal-monetary coordination to stimulate nominal demand. Policy debates have been focused upon the inflationary expectations that may be generated by monetary financing or related policies, consistent with New Consensus Macroeconomics theoretical frameworks. Historical examples of fiscal-monetary policy coordination have been largely neglected, along with alternative theoretical views, such as post-Keynesian perspectives that emphasise uncertainty and demand rather than rational expectations. This paper begins to address this omission. First, we provide an overview of the holdings of government debt by both central banks and commercial banks as an imperfect but still informative proxy for fiscal-monetary coordination in advanced economies in the 20th century. Second, we develop a new typology of forms of fiscal-monetary coordination that includes both direct and less direct forms of monetary financing, illustrating this with case-study examples. In particular, we focus on the 1930s1970s period when central banks and ministries of finance cooperated closely, with less independence accorded to monetary policy and greater weight attached to fiscal policy. We find a number of cases where fiscal-monetary coordination proved useful in stimulating economic growth, supporting industrial policy objectives and managing public debt without excessive inflation.

AB  - Amidst the seemingly conflicting results among researchers on the impact the duo of exchange rate and monetary policy has on the economy, an attempt was made to examine the impact of exchange rate and monetary policy on economic growth in Nigeria for the period spanning 1986 and 2020. To this end, a model was drawn and analysed using co-integration and error correction mechanism. Having conducted descriptive analysis, stationarity test and co-integration test, the estimates from ECM and long run shows that exchange rate negatively impact on economic growth while monetary policy positively impact on economic growth. The structural stability of the model was tested and affirmed using cumulative sum of recursive residuals-CUSUM. In the light of the empirical findings, it was recommended that concerted effort should be made to stabilize exchange rate for it to be positively responsive to growth and that for a more efficient and effective management of the economy, monetary authority should operate without undue influence from political office holders.

TI  - THE IMPACT OF MONETARY POLICY ON THE ECONOMIC GROWTH IN TURKEY
AU  - Abdullah, Yousif
AB  - This thesis aimed to find out the impact of monetary policy on the economic
growth in Turkey between the years 2006-2018; quarterly secondary data were
used that collected from Central Bank of the Republic of Turkey (CBRT) and
World Bank. Augmented Dicky-Fuller (ADF) test was implied to test the
stationary and presence of unit root of the series while the Auto Regressive
Distribution Lag (ARDL) model conducted to investigate the relationship
between monetary policy and economic growth in Turkey during the given
period. The goal of this thesis is to examin the impacts of monetary policy on
the economic growth in Turkey. In other words, whether the interest rate,
inflation rate and money supply have impacts on the economic growth or not.
The unit root test indicated that the variables were stationary at I(0) and I(1),
accordingly the variables are qualified to apply ARDL model. The result of the
F-bound test confirmed long run co-integration between the variables, the
figure of ECM is positive, it means that there is no long run equilibrium
converging. The study shows that monetary policy only has short-run effects
on the economic growth in Turkey. Inflation in the short run is statistically
insignificant, while, interest rate and money supply are statistically significant
and they have negative impact on the economic growth in the short run. In
contrast, in the long-run,all variables including interest rate, inflation rate and
money supply are statistically insignificant, in other word they do not affects
the economic growth in the long run in Turkey during the study period. The
study recomends Create appropriate environment for both domestic and
foreign investors by restoring confidence and economic stability to promote
economic growth. As monetary policy alone is unable to effectively promote
economic growth, fiscal policy also should use in line with monetary policy to
accelerate economic growth.

TI  - Transmission Mechanism of Monetary Policy in Nigeria
AU  - Okaro, Celestine Sunday Ogonna
AB  - This paper, explored the empirical importance of credit. It adds to the existing literature in two ways. First, it analyses in a systematic way both endogenous and exogenous instruments of monetary mechanism using information on the country’s main economic objectives as a proxy for bank credit availability by providing a framework in which to analyse the evidence in controlling money and credit. Second, by using bank’s prices (rather than quantities) it provides an alternative way to disentangle loan supply from loan demand shift in the ‘credit channel’ literature. The paper also provides empirical evidence on the role of banks in the monetary transmission process. The principal channel appears through lending to firms, which influences entire economy investment. The existence of an effective banking industry is necessary for every economy because it create the necessary environment for economic growth and development through its role in intermediating funds from surplus to deficit economic units. This stimulates investment economic growth, and employment as well as international trade and payment. The bottom line is that credit is an important part of the transmission process of Nigerian Monetary Policy.

T2  - The British Journal of Politics and International Relations
AB  - This article presents a comparative analysis of the determinants, sustenance and broader macroeconomic consequences of the ultimately unsustainable housing boom in Ireland and the UK in recent years. It examines, in particular, the role played by ostensibly depoliticised monetary policy in both contexts in the development of a house price bubble that has served to fuel consumer-led growth. It assesses the viability, sustainability and reproducibility of the private debt-financed consumer boom that house price inflation has generated. In the process it draws attention to the increasingly differentiated character of both government inflationary preferences and counter-inflationary performance?with the shift to official measures of inflation that exclude mortgage interest repayments and, in the UK at least, to the covert re-politicisation of monetary policy. It concludes by suggesting that governments may well not have time-inconsistent inflationary preferences so much as sectorally specific inflationary preferences. This might be summarised in terms of the aphorism: ?retail price inflation bad, house price inflation good?.

AB  - We explore the growth and welfare effects of monetary policy in a Schumpeterian economy with cash-in-advance (CIA)-constrained research and development (R&D) investment in both the upstream and downstream sectors. We show that the nominal interest rate can have an inverted-U relation with economic growth due to its effects on labor allocations between manufacturing and R&D and between the R&D sectors. Furthermore, aggregate R&D overinvestment is generally sufficient but not necessary for the Friedman rule of zero nominal interest rates to be suboptimal. Calibrated using data from U.S. manufacturing firms, our model features a positive welfare-maximizing nominal interest rate despite aggregate R&D underinvestment.

TI  - MONETARY POLICY AND ECONOMIC GROWTH: LESSONS FROM EAST AFRICAN COUNTRIES
AU  - Nyorekwa, Enock Twinoburyo
AB  - This study empirically examines the impact of monetary policy on economic growth in
three East African countries (Uganda, Kenya and Tanzania). The role of monetary
policy in promoting economic growth remains empirically an open research question, as
both the empirical and theoretical underpinnings are not universal, and the results
remain varying, inconsistent, and inconclusive. This study may be the first of its kind to
examine in detail the impact of monetary policy on economic growth in Uganda, Kenya
and Tanzania – using the autoregressive distributed lag (ARDL) bounds-testing
approach. This study used two proxies of monetary policy, namely, money supply and
interest rate, to examine this linkage. The results were found to differ from country to
country and over time. The Uganda empirical results reveal that money supply has a
positive impact on economic growth, both in the short run and in the long run. However,
interest rate was found to have a positive impact on economic growth only in the short
run. In the long run, interest rate has no significant impact on economic growth. In
Kenya, both short-run and long-run empirical results support monetary policy neutrality,
implying that monetary policy has no effect on economic growth – both in the short run
and in the long run. The results from Tanzania also reveal no impact of monetary policy
on economic growth in the long run – irrespective of the proxy used to measure
monetary policy. However, the short-run results only reveal no impact of monetary
policy on economic growth only when the interest rate is used as a proxy for monetary
policy. When money supply is used to measure monetary policy, a negative relationship
between monetary policy and economic growth is found to dominate. Overall, the study
finds that monetary policy is only relevant for economic growth in Uganda and only
when money supply is used as monetary policy variable. Therefore this study
recommends a money supply based monetary policy framework for Uganda. The study
findings also suggest that monetary policy may not be a panacea for economic growth
in Kenya and Tanzania.

TI  - Study on the Influence of Monetary Policy on Real Estate Price in China
AU  - Yan, Na
T2  - Journal of Service Science and Management
AB  - The real estate industry has been in a stage of rapid development since 2000, and its pulling effect on economic growth is very significant, but it has continued to develop at a rapid pace over the years. The rising prices that follow have also had a lot of impact on all aspects of society and economy. However, a country’s macroeconomic control policy, especially monetary policy, has a very important impact on the development of the real estate industry. For example, the expansionary monetary policy since 2008 has increased the money supply, so that the real estate market investment and consumption rising, house prices accelerated. Although there are also a lot of restrictions of macroeconomic policy on the rise of house prices, the effect is not obvious. Therefore, it is necessary to make use of the policy means to regulate the real estate industry in order to achieve healthy development. This paper first analyzes the mechanism of monetary policy influencing real estate price, and then discusses the effect of monetary policy on real estate market by using empirical research method. It is found that both money supply and interest rate will have an impact on real estate price. Finally, combined with the conclusion of the analysis, some policy suggestions are put forward to improve the monetary policy system for the healthy development of the real estate industry.

TI  - The Impacts of IPO Financing and Monetary Policy on Economic Growth in Bangladesh: Evidence from a Dynamic Assessment
AU  - Barua, Suborna
AU  - Akter, Mahmuda
AB  - Bangladesh is considered a fast-growing emerging economy and the new Asian tiger. The increasing need for capital funds in Bangladesh is largely met by banks, mainly due to the country’s underdeveloped nature of the stock market. Bank ﬁnancing is assumed to be inﬂuenced by monetary policies, particularly, by bank rates adopted each year by the central bank of Bangladesh. On the other hand, while some studies stress the need for strengthening the debt and equity securities markets to support Bangladesh’s fast economic growth, debates swirl about whether or to what extent the stock market contributes to economic growth in the country. To address the understanding gap, in this paper, we examine the impact of capital ﬁnancing through equity initial public oﬀerings (IPO) and bank rate on the economic growth of Bangladesh. We use annual data from 1981 to 2019 and employ an autoregressive distributive lag (ARDL) framework to examine the long-run and short-run impacts of IPO ﬁnancing and bank rate on GDP growth rate. Our ﬁndings suggest the existence of a long-run cointegrating relationship between IPO ﬁnancing, bank rate, and GDP growth. We ﬁnd that IPO ﬁnancing does not have a signiﬁcant long-run impact but shows only a one-period short-run positive impact on economic growth. On the other hand, bank rate shows a long-run negative and a one-period short-run positive impact on economic growth. Findings overall suggest that IPO ﬁnancing does not signiﬁcantly contribute to long-run economic growth while giving only a temporary boost. Further, increases in bank rate - as one would expect - depress economic growth in the long-run, while generating herd behavior immediately. Our ﬁndings stress the need for encouraging more quality IPO issuances, increasing the issuance size, and ensuring proper utilization of the funds by IPO issuers to make the capital market a key driver of economic growth.

TI  - MONETARY POLICY MANAGEMENT AND ECONOMIC GROWTH IN NIGERIA: NEW LESSONS RELEARNED
AU  - Adedayo, Taiwo
AB  - This research study examines the existing links between monetary policy management and economic growth in Nigeria within the period 1960-2018. An autoregressive distributed lag (ARDL) approach was employed to evaluate the cointegration as well as the short-run and long-run estimates. The findings showed that a long-run relationship exists between monetary policy and economic growth within the periods understudied. Concerning the estimated parameters, the results reported that interest rate, deposit rate and liquidity ratio positively drive short-run output growth whereas, monetary policy rate, Treasury bill rate, and cash reserve ratio have a direct impact on short-run output growth in Nigeria. Meanwhile, in the long-run, monetary policy rate and deposit rate enhance real income growth, while Treasury bill rate and cash reserve ratio negatively affect output growth of the Nigerian economy. On the policy front, there is need for the apex bank to harmonize the expansionary part of the monetary policy with the contractionary part during the implementation process of the recent Economic Recovery and Growth Plan (ERGP) in 2017 aimed at turning the slump situation around and also projecting a strong growth rate in GDP at 4.5%.

TI  - Threshold effect of inflation on economic growth in Nigeria
AU  - Bawa, Sani

T2  - CBN Journal of Applied Statistics
AB  - It is widely believed that price stability promote long-term economic growth, whereas high inflation is inimical to growth. This paper utilized a quarterly time series data for the period 1981 - 2009 to estimate a threshold level of inflation for Nigeria. Using a threshold regression model developed by Khan and Senhadji (2001), the study estimated a threshold inflation level of 13 per cent for Nigeria. Below the threshold level, inflation has a mild effect on economic activities, while above it, the magnitude of the negative effect of inflation on growth was high. The negative and significant relationship between inflation and economic growth for inflation rates both below and above the threshold level is robust with respect to changes in econometric methodology, additional explanatory variables and changes in data frequency. These finding are essential for monetary policy formulation as it provide a guide for the policy makers to choose an optimal target for inflation, which is consistent with long-term sustainable economic growth goals of the country.

AB  - The paper conducts a qualitative narrative appraisal of the existing empirical literature on the key macroeconomic determinants of economic growth in developing and developed countries. Much as other empirical studies have investigated the determinants of economic growth using various econometric methods, the majority of these studies have not distinguished what drives or hinders economic growth in developing or developed countries. The study finds that the determinants of economic growth are different when this distinction is used. It reveals that in developing countries the key macroeconomic determinants of economic growth include foreign aid, foreign direct investment, fiscal policy, investment, trade, human capital development, demographics, monetary policy, natural resources, reforms and geographic, regional, political and financial factors. In developed countries, the study reveals that the key macroeconomic determinants that are associated with economic growth include physical capital, fiscal policy, human capital, trade, demographics, monetary policy and financial and technological factors.

AB  - We develop a two-sector monetary economy with human capital accumulation and a cash constraint applied to both consumption and investment to examine the ways in which social status affects the impact of monetary policy on the long-run economic growth rate. Our findings suggest that the formation of human capital is an important determinant to the super-neutrality of money in the growth-rate sense. Within an economy with Lucas-type human capital formation, money is super-neutral; however, within an economy where human capital accumulation formation is more generalized, and in which both physical and human capital are used as inputs, the growth rate in money will have a negative effect on the long-run growth rate of the economy. The existence, uniqueness and saddle-path stability of balanced-growth equilibrium are also examined.

AB  - The Nigerian economy attracts abundance of foreign capital inflows and credit supply; hence, an adverse external credit shock might lead to a large decrease of external inflows due to global credit tightening, which may leave the domestic economy in deep recession. In this case, domestic monetary policy tools should be preferred to mitigate the external adverse effect on the domestic economy and stimulate investment. As a result, an important issue of concern in this study is how can the use of monetary policy tools mitigate the effect of external credit shocks on economic growth in Nigeria? In answering this question, this study attempted to assess the influence of monetary policy tools on external credit and economic growth nexus in Nigeria, using annual data covering 36 years for the period 1980–2015. The study adopted the Cobb–Douglas production function and estimated a specified model using autoregressive distributed lag cointegration approach. The study found out that cash reserve requirement, which is credit policy easing, is significant in growing the Nigerian economy, as compared to monetary policy rate. The implication of this is that, if credit policy easing is properly implemented, it could be efficient in offsetting adverse external credit shocks.

AB  - The role of monetary policy in determining long-run economic growth from an Islamic perspective is explored. The monetary authority regulates the financial sector to allocate resources and finances its budget through seigniorage and zakat revenue. It is shown that, in an environment in which financial institutions use capital-augmented technologies to transform resources into output and private agents maximize intertemporal utility over consumption and money balances, a rise in inflation hampers growth and reduces welfare, while financial innovation (or equivalently financial regulation) promotes growth and improves welfare. Therefore, the injunction against fixed interest payments induces the monetary authority in an Islamic economy to develop and innovate alternative financial instruments that do not have fixed nominal values and do not bear predetermined rates of interest.

AB  - To achieve high and sustainable economic growth, full employment and stable prices, countries are using macroeconomic policies called; the fiscal and the monetary policies. Regarding the effectiveness of these theories, there are two different arguments; monetarists and Keynesian. The Keynesians argue that relative to the monetary policies, fiscal policies are more effective in influencing the economy especially during the liquidity trap. However, monetarists argue that money supply is the most significant driver of economic growth by influencing the households demand for goods, firms production and hence economic growth. Hence, monetarists believe that monetary policy is more effective than fiscal policy. Having the above contradicting ideas, using the Johansen cointegration approach, this study examined whether the fiscal or the monetary policy is more effective on the economic growth of Ethiopia for the period running from 1981 to 2008. The study shows that both fiscal and monetary policies have significantly increased the economic growth of Ethiopia. However, relative to the monetary policies, the fiscal policies are more effective. Finally, the study recommends that policy makers should focus on both policies to enhance the Ethiopian economy.

AB  - The price of oil more than halved in less than 5 months since September 2014, after nearly 5 years of stability. This chapter analyzes the reasons behind the recent drop in oil prices in both the demand and supply side of the oil market. Specifically, it sheds light on one of the most important reasons in the demand side, which is coming from the monetary policy that has been neglected in most interpretations. The authors of this chapter in their earlier research (Yoshino and Taghizadeh-Hesary, Int J Monet Econ Finance 7(3):157–174, 2014) found that this latter reason had significant impact in inflating the price of oil in 2009 following the subprime mortgage crisis when the world economy was in recession. By the easy monetary policy of the United States (US) and some other developed economies following the crisis, in early 2009 a large amount of liquidity entered into the oil market, since the developed economies were in recession, so they need a safe place in which to invest. In 2014 and 2015, following the recovery of the US economy and especially its capital market, liquidities that had moved from the disordered developed economies’ capital markets to oil and commodities markets during the global financial crisis of 2008–2009 in order to keep their real values, are coming back to capital markets, hence it reduced the global oil demand sharply which pushed the oil prices down.

AB  - While the oil price shocks of the 1970s can be explained by pure supply factors, starting in the 1980s oil prices increasingly began to come under a different type of pressure. Oil prices accelerated from about $35 per barrel in 1981 to beyond $111 per barrel in 2011. At the same time interest rates subsided from 16.7 % per annum to about 0.1 %. This chapter explains how this long-term price increase in most cases, was caused by expansionary monetary policies that heightened oil prices through interest rate channels. Aggressive monetary policies stimulated oil demand and blew up oil prices, a trend that led to slower economic growth. As for elasticities the results described in this chapter show that demand is price elastic and, unlike some earlier literature states, it is significantly elastic to income too. In the last section, the results show that oil prices adjust instantly, declaring the existence of equilibrium in the oil market during the period from 1960 to 2011.

AB  - This chapter develops a New Keynesian model to examine a theoretical global economy with two basic macroeconomic components: an energy producer and an energy consumer. (From now on in this chapter whenever we refer to the “energy” or “energy prices”, we refer to “crude oil” and “crude oil price”, which is the main source of energy.) This simple economy uses these two components to evaluate how oil prices affect the consumer economy’s gross domestic product and inflation from 1960 to 2011. This model assumes that changes in the oil price transfer to macro variables through either supply (aggregate supply curve) or demand channels (aggregate demand curve). In order to examine the effects of this transfer, an IS curve is used to look at the demand side and a Phillips curve is used to analyze inflationary effects from the supply side. The empirical analysis concludes that movements in the oil price mainly affect the economy through the demand side (shifting the aggregate demand curve) by affecting household expenditures and energy consumption. This analysis provides several additional findings, among which is that easy monetary policies amplify energy demand more than supply, resulting in skyrocketing crude oil prices, which inhibit economic growth.

AB  - This research examines how monetary policy has affected crude oil prices after the subprime mortgage crisis. Our earlier research (Taghizadeh-Hesary F, Yoshino N, OPEC Energy Rev 38(1):1–20, 2014) found a significant impact of easy monetary policy on energy prices from 1980 to 2011. This chapter reports that the quantitative easing of United States (US) monetary policies weakened the US dollar by shifting US investors to invest in the oil market and other commodity markets. An empirical analysis shows that the weaker exchange rate of the dollar pushed up the oil price in 2009–2012, while world gross domestic product was not significant at all since the global economy was in a recession in that period. This trend had the effect of imposing a longer recovery time on the global economy, as oil has been shown to be one of the most important production inputs.

AB  - This chapter assess the impact of crude oil price movements on two macroeconomic variables—gross domestic product (GDP) growth rate and the consumer price index inflation rate—in three economies: the United States and Japan (developed economies) and the People’s Republic of China (PRC) (emerging economy). These economies were chosen for this research because they are the world’s three largest oil consumers. The main objective of this research is to see whether these economies are still reactive to oil price movements. The results obtained suggest that the impact of oil price fluctuations on developed oil importers’ GDP growth is much milder than on the GDP growth of an emerging economy. On the other hand, however, the impact of oil price fluctuations on the PRC’s inflation rate was found to be milder than in the two developed economies that were examined.

AB  - Japan has reached the limits of conventional macroeconomic policies. Recently, the Bank of Japan, in order to overcome the deflation and achieve sustainable economic growth, set the inflation target at 2 % and implemented aggressive monetary policy to achieve this target as soon as possible. Although prices started to rise after the Bank of Japan implemented monetary easing, the main reason for this price elevation may not come directly from easy monetary policy, but other sources such as higher oil prices. High oil prices in yen, which is the result of a depreciated yen, is one of the main causes of the inflation. Moreover, this chapter shows that quantitative easing may not stimulate the Japanese economy. Aggregate demand that includes private investment did not increase significantly in Japan when the interest rate was lowered. Private investment displays this unconventional behavior because of uncertainty about the future and the aging population. We believe that the remedy for the Japanese economy is not monetary policy. The government needs to look for serious structural changes and growth strategies.

AB  - This research evaluates the impact of oil price shocks on oil producing and consuming economies; we used a simultaneous equation framework for different economies with business relations. As expected, we found that oil producers (in this study, Iran and the Russian Federation) benefit from oil price shocks. However contrary to previous findings, they also benefit from the indirect effect through their trade partners. For oil-consuming economies, the effects are more diverse. In some economies, output falls in response to an oil price shock, while some others seem to be immune. Generally, those economies that trade more with oil producers gain indirect benefits via higher demand from oil producers. For instance, the Netherlands, Germany, France, Italy, the United States, the United Kingdom, and the People’s Republic of China get negative direct effects and positive indirect effects from oil producing economies. This is exactly the result that we anticipated. India has both negative effects directly and indirectly and seems to suffer more in a positive oil price shock. For Japan, Spain, Switzerland, and Turkey the results are reversed. They benefit from an oil shock directly and indirectly.

TI  - Can monetary policy drive economic growth? Empirical evidence from Tanzania
AU  - Nyorekwa, Enock Twinoburyo
AB  - The role of monetary policy in promoting economic growth remains empirically an open research question. This paper attempts to bridge the knowledge gap by investigating the impact of monetary policy on economic growth in Tanzania during the period from 1975 to 2013 – using the autoregressive distributed lag (ARDL) bounds-testing approach. The study uses two proxies of monetary policy, namely, money supply and interest rate, to examine this linkage. The empirical results of this study confirm the existence of long-run monetary policy neutrality – irrespective of the proxy used to measure monetary policy. However, the short-run results only confirm the existence of monetary policy neutrality – but only when the interest rate is used as a proxy for monetary policy. When money supply is used to measure monetary policy, a negative relationship between monetary policy and economic growth is found to predominate

T2  - Research in International Business and Finance
AB  - In the present paper, we assess the long-run relationship between FDI inflows and the financial environment in 16 EU countries. For this purpose, we use a cointegration technique for heterogeneous panels and the FMOLS and DOLS estimators, over the period 2001–2015. We show that financial conditions are important for FDI inflows. More precisely, the monetary uncertainty, calculated as the difference between the recorded and the forecasted interest rate values, negatively affects the FDI inflows. In addition, the banking stability, measured through different Z-score specifications, positively influences the foreign investment. However, this result is influenced by the way the Z-score is calculated. We further report a positive relationship between the business cycle and the FDI entrance. The robustness analyses based on alternative specifications of monetary uncertainty and banking stability confirm our findings. These results are also supported by a PMG estimation. Therefore, authorities must pay special attention to monetary policy predictability and to banking stability in order to facilitate the investors’ access to finance and their investment decision.

AU  - Liu, Chun
AB  - The game between the growth rate and quality of the Chinese economy under the conditions of the new normal economy is a hot and difficult issue in the current new normal of socialist economic development with Chinese characteristics. Traditional monetary policy regulation focuses on the regulation of the rate of economic growth. The new changes in the current economic development situation are more inclined to promote the improvement of the quality of economic growth. Therefore, how to adapt to the new normal of economic development has put forward new requirements for the regulation and reform of monetary policy. Based on the relationship between China’s monetary policy regulation and the quality of economic growth under the conditions of the new normal economy, this paper selects statistical data on monetary policy regulation and the quality of economic development and growth from 2001 to 2016 to construct a dynamic panel data model of the economy and regulate monetary policy Predictive analysis with the quality of economic growth. The results show that after 2016, the economic growth rate has further slowed down and the quality of economic growth has improved significantly. In particular, it has been found that the contribution rate of the three industries after 2013 has increased significantly year-on-year. Optimize and upgrade.

AB  - This paper studies the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the sustainability of Chinese economic growth, government debt, and income inequality by constructing a new Keynesian dynamic stochastic general equilibrium (NK-DSGE) model. The choice of monetary policy targets is then analyzed to hedge the impact of the pandemic. We find that: (1) the aggregate demand and labor demand shocks caused by the COVID-19 pandemic posed serious challenges to the sustainable development of the economy and debt, and increased social inequality; (2) when the impact of the pandemic is mainly reflected in the recession in aggregate demand, monetary policy should pay more attention to the target of price stability; (3) when the impact of the pandemic is mainly reflected in a decline in labor demand, monetary policy should focus more on the target of economic growth; (4) when the pandemic has a significant impact on both aggregate demand and labor demand, a monetary policy which focuses more on the target of economic growth is conducive to minimizing welfare losses. Targeted policy implications, such as selecting monetary policy targets according to different manifestations of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and placing emphasis on monetary policy tools to stimulate consumption, alleviate unemployment, and alleviate social inequality, are suggested to improve the sustainability of the Chinese economy.

T2  - International Finance
AB  - Previous studies on whether the nature of the exchange rate regime influences a country's medium-term growth performance have been based on a tripartite classification scheme that distinguishes between pegged, intermediate and flexible exchange rate regimes. This classification scheme, however, leads to a situation where two of the categories (intermediate and flexible) characterize solely the exchange rate regime, whereas the third (pegged) characterizes both the exchange rate regime and the monetary policy framework. Our study refines this classification scheme by accounting for different monetary policy frameworks, classifying monetary arrangements based on the presence of an explicit monetary policy ‘anchor’, such as the exchange rate or other targeted nominal variable. We estimate the impact of exchange rate arrangements on growth in a panel-data set of 60 countries over the period 1973–1998. We find evidence that exchange rate regimes characterized by a monetary policy anchor, whether they are pegged, intermediate, or flexible, exert a positive influence on economic growth. We also find evidence that intermediate/flexible regimes without an anchor are detrimental for growth. Our results thus suggest that it is the presence of a monetary policy anchor, rather than the type of exchange rate regime per se, that is important for economic growth. Furthermore, our work emphasizes the importance of considering the monetary policy framework that accompanies the exchange rate arrangement when assessing the macroeconomic performance of alternative exchange rate regimes.

AB  - This research work examined Effect of Monetary Policy Instruments on Economic Growth of Nigeria from 1985-2016. The study was anchored mainly on the quantity theory of money. The researcher used secondary data from the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) Statistical Bulletin from 1985-2016. The data collected were analyzed using descriptive statistics such as Mean, Standard Deviation and Skewness and the relationship between the variables of the model was tested using Autoregressive Distributed Lag Model (ARDL) regression analysis after the data was found to be stationary and integrated of different orders. The result of the ARDL regression analysis shows that monetary policy rate has positive but insignificant relationship (p>0.05) with economic growth, whereas liquidity ratio has a negative relationship with economic growth. The negative relationship between liquidity ratio and economic growth is significant at 5% (p<0.05) level of significance. Thus, this leads to the acceptance of the null hypothesis for hypothesis one and two as the p-values of the f-statistic are greater than 0.05 (insignificant at 5% level of significance). This study concludes that monetary policy does not affect economic growth in Nigeria significantly. It is thus left for further study on fiscal policy or the combination of the two to see the effect on economic growth. It was recommended that the Central Bank of Nigeria should further develop the financial sector through making more funds available to the private sector by reducing monetary policy rate which affects interest rate ceiling on loans to the private sector. And that there should be consistency in policy objectives of the CBN. Policy inconsistency often sends the wrong signal to stakeholders in various sectors.

AB  - The paper contributes to understanding the impact of financial system indicators on economic growth. A particular emphasis is placed on financial structure indicators, which measure the specific organization of the financial system, namely, banking sector concentration, foreign bank penetration, government regulation and the efficiency of the banking industry - as opposed to depth indicators, which measure financial market liquidity. In this respect (1) the concentration of banks was found to have a detrimental impact on growth. However, concentration may also have indirect and positive impacts on growth depending on a countries initial stage of economic development, i.e. for comparatively more developed countries, the negative impact of concentration on long-run growth is lower. (2) Financial liquidity indicators, which work through both physical capital accumulation and total factor productivity, have a strong impact on economic growth. The catalyst role capita, finally, determines the growth path of an economy. Low initial real GDP is positively related to the growth path of economies in terms of the "latecomer advantage". Given the detrimental effects of banking sector concentration on economic growth, a tentative policy conclusion would be that antitrust authorities should strive to maintain competitively structured markets. In order to increase competition in an environment subject to mergers, which significantly reduce the number of financial services providers, obstacles to the mobility of customers should be removed, for example by setting and enforcing transparency rules regarding products and prices for financial services.

AB  - Monetary policy was for a long time sidelined because adherents to Keynesian ideas considered it merely complementary to fiscal policy. But monetary policy attracted renewed interest with the failure of Keynesian theory to explain the parallel rise in inflation and unemployment in the late 1960s. Because monetary policy is one of the main instruments of economic policy, it contributes to the achievement of the latter’s objectives. While it is considered to have some effect on the control of inflation, its impact on economic activity remains the subject of lively debate among economists.

The unit root testing result suggests that all variables are stationary at first difference; therefore, the Johansen Cointegration and Error Correction Model has been employed to analyze the association between variables. The finding shows that money supply, interest rate and inflation rate negatively effect on the real GDP per capita in the long run and only the real exchange rate has a positive sign. The error correction model result indicates the existence of short run causality between money supply, real exchange rate and real GDP per capita.

AU  - Igbafe, Timothy
AB  - This study examined the effectiveness of monetary policy in stimulating economic growth in Nigeria between 1990 and 2019.
Secondary data were sourced mainly from CBN publications. The theoretical framework was based on the Keynesian
transmission mechanism. In the cause of empirical investigation, various advanced econometric techniques like Augmented
Dickey Fuller Unit Root Test, ARDL Bounds Test and Error Correction Mechanism (ECM) were employed and the result revealed
that all the variables were stationary at first difference except monetary policy rate that was stationary at level, meaning that the
variables were integrated of different order justifying ARDL Bounds Test and error correction mechanism test. The ARDL Bounds
Test result indicated that there is long run relationship among the variables with the lower bound and upper bound less than the
calculated at 5% level of significant. The result of the error correction mechanism (ECM) test indicates an 88% adjustment back
to equilibrium. It is therefore recommended that since economic growth in Nigeria is greatly influenced in the long-run by interest
rate and reserve requirement making monetary policy an effective tool in stimulating economic growth. Nigerian government
through its monetary authorities should unveil other policies that will stimulate economic growth not only in the long run but also,
in the short run period.

AU  - Tarawalie, Abu Bakarr
AU  - Kargbo, Noah
T2  - International Journal of Economics and Financial Issues
AB  - This paper empirically examines the relative effectiveness of fiscal and monetary policies on economic growth in Sierra Leone. The study utilizes annual time series data, spanning from 1980 to 2017, within an autoregressive distributed lag Bound Testing estimation framework popularized by Hashem, and Yongcheol (1998). The unit root test results show that all the variables are integrated of order one, i.e. I(1), and the cointegration bound testing results confirm the existence of cointegration amongst the variables. The study reveals that monetary policy is more effective than fiscal policy in promoting economic growth in Sierra Leone. Specifically, the findings show that money supply, real exchange rate and inflation are the significant variables that influence economic growth in the long run. Whilst the finding shows a positive relationship between money supply and economic growth, it however reveals a negative relationship for both real exchange rate and inflation on growth during the study period. The short run dynamics also reveals that money supply, government revenue, government expenditure and war dummy are the main variables influencing real GDP growth in Sierra Leone. Furthermore, the result shows that 24% of the disequilibrium in real GDP is corrected within a year. The study recommends that monetary and fiscal policies should be well coordinated and government should implement a balanced budget in order to overcome the issue of fiscal dominance in the Sierra Leone economy.

AB  - In this paper, we estimated affecting and important variables of fiscal and monetary policy on economic growth with comparing 3 models (BMA), (DMA) and (DMS) base on accuracy review of estimate model (MSFA), (MAFA). We have understood (BMA) model is an optimal model due to lower prediction error indicators that have shown in table [1]. So we identified the most important and affecting variables on economic growth with considering 62 indicators base on empirical data for determining affecting variables on economic growth, that with using BMA model. By doing the calculations and investigating the effect of 62 factors that have been effective in empirical studies on economic growth, it has been determined that the effect of 11 variables will be meaningful and these variables have always retained their effect, and in the presence of other variables, they have retained their effect. These variables are determined according to the posterior probability (i.e., the highest importance in explaining the economic growth and in other words the most likely to be present in the model). Capital Investment(K), Employment(L), Liquidity(M), Interest Rate(R), Inflation Rate(P), Government Expenditure(G), Balance of Payments (BP), Taxes(T), Oil Revenues (Troil), Gini Coefficient (Gni) and Saving Rate (S) are the affecting and important variables of fiscal and monetary policy on economic growth.

AB  - This paper examines the impact of monetary policy on economic growth and inflation in Nepal. The impact on economic growth and inflation have been observed using monetary policy instruments/indicators such as CRR, bank rate, interbank rate, M1, M2, private sector credit based on quarterly data from first quarter of 2006 to fourth quarter of 2018. The impact on economic growth and inflation rate has been examined separately. The econometric methods like ADF test, ARDL Model, Bound Test, Error Correction Model, Residual Test and Stability test have been used in the study. The empirical results show that economic growth and inflation are influenced by monetary policy. CRR, bank rate, broad money and private sector credit are significant to have impact on economic growth. Likewise, money supply (M1 and M2) has impact on inflation. The result shows that it takes longer time to have impact of broad money and private sector credit on economic growth than on inflation.

AB  - This study examined the impact of financial market and monetary policy on the Nigerian economy since Nigeria introduced democratic rule in 2001 to 2020. Financial market was proxied by total market capitalization, while monetary policy was proxied by money supply, and interest rate the moderator variable. The ADF unit root was adopted to test the level of stationarity of the variables, and all the variables attained stationarity either at first difference or at second difference. The study adopted the regression analysis as the data analysis method. Findings from the study revealed that: Market capitalization, a proxy for financial market had positive and significant impact on Gross Domestic Product, a proxy for the Nigerian economy, Money supply, a proxy for monetary policy had positive and significant impact on Gross Domestic Product, a proxy for the Nigerian economy and Interest rate, a moderator variable had a positive but not significant impact on Gross Domestic Product, a proxy for the Nigerian economy. The study therefore recommends that: Government should restore confidence in the financial market by showing true commitment and sincerity of purpose in the capital market probe, there is need for a diversified investment instruments in the capital market whereby debt and derivative instruments will assume as much prominence as ownership instruments and Government should do everything possible to provide a safe and conducive investment climate by nipping in the bud, the prevalent activities of terrorist and kidnappers. This will not only encourage the Nigerian investors, but also attract foreign investors into the Nigerian capital market.

AB  - This study investigates the dynamic impact of monetary policy on stock return in the manufacturing sector of Pakistan over the period of 2001-2010. Monetary instruments that have been used in this study include cash reserve ratio and discount rate whereas company-specific variables have been represented by sales growth, leverage and size. Results reveal that monetary policy and company specific factors have a significant impact on stock returns, there by sustaining the notion of monetary policy transmission. Cash reserve ratio and the discount rate is found to be negatively impact on stock returns while inflation have positive impact and money supply has positive has negative impact on stock returns. Company-specific variables, size of the firms has a significant negative impact on stock returns while sales growth and leverage are insignificant. The results of this study suggest some important implications for investors. Whenever the SBP increases the cash reserve ratio (CRR) and discount rate, investors should be more vigilant in considering these factors while making an investment decision because an increase in the cash reserve ratio generates less return on their investment portfolio.

TI  - IMPACT OF MONETARY POLICY ON FISHERY FOR ECONOMIC GROWTH OF NIGERIA
AB  - This study examined the impact of monetary policy on fishery growth in Nigeria economy. It adopted the error correction model (ECM) techniques to analyze the times series data. The result of the ECM confirms the existence of long-run equilibrium between the dependent and independent variables. Available information reveals policy instability and duplication of programs and projects under different policies. Analysis also shows fluctuation of fishery output over the years. The AugmentedDickey Filler (ADF) test indicates stationarity one-difference lagged length, except inflation rate. The study shows that long run relationship exists among the variables. The core finding of this study shows that money supply and interest rate are significant monetary policy instruments that drive the growth in Nigeria. It is consequently recommended that the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) should introduce more monetary instruments that are flexible enough to meet the ever-growing financial sector in order to attract both domestic and foreign investors; while more stringent punishment should be made for non-compliance to the monetary policies by financial institutions.

AB  - The article presents the study results of the European Central Bank Monetary Policy influence on the Poland, Hungary, Czech Republic, and Slovak Republic financial indicators. By running vector autoregression models and applying Granger causality tests the study reveals the impact of the European Central Bank Monetary Policy on the yield of government bonds, interest rates and the inflow of foreign investments into the CEE countries. The results of the analysis demonstrate that the ECB monetary policy had an overall positive impact on the economies of Poland, Hungary and Czech Republic. In the context of a general decrease of interest rates under the influence of the ECB's unconventional monetary policy, these countries managed to achieve sustainable economic growth along with a decrease in the ratio of government debt to GDP and the ratio of interest payable on debt to GDP as well as stock indices growth. The opposite situation is observed in the euro area countries with a high debt burden, primarily in Greece and Italy. Although the ECB policy had led to the decrease of the interest payable on debt to GDP of the high debt euro area countries, the trend of the ratio of government debt to GDP growth for them (except Ireland) has an upward trend. In this situation, the ECB cannot significantly change the goals of its monetary policy, because any, even slight, increase in the discount rate will lead to a new euro area debt crisis with an epicenter in Italy and Greece. The situation may get worse after a probable sharp decline in the US stock market, caused by its current overheating

AB  - This paper analyzes the banks’ behavior in selecting their portfolio composition and their impact on the effectiveness of monetary policy transmission process in Indonesia. We employ an analytical model of the banking portfolio behavior based on microeconomic theory to understand how banks’ portfolio behavior in maximizing their profit links to the efficacy of monetary policy. This study finds that micro banking factors affects the effectiveness of monetary policy. This study also finds structural changes in banks and borrowers have altered the effectiveness of monetary policy to encourage the economic growth and hindered the process of economic recovery. As perception on risk has large impact in supporting the effectiveness of the monetary policy, effort to reduce risk through the formation as credit bureau, credit guarantee scheme, and rating agencies is critical as it will improve transparency and availability of debtor information. The need for better coordination and harmonization between macro and micro policies would be beneficial.

AB  - Monetary and Fiscal policies are instruments which the government of any nation can employ to effectively achieve the desired growth of their respective economies. This study investigates the extent to which monetary policies can promote economic growth in Nigeria from 1980-2017. Secondary data were used from the Statistical Bulletin of the apex bank in Nigeria (CBN) and National Bureau of Statistics. Unit root test, Johansen co-integration and the vector error correction model (VECM) were employed in analyzing the data collected for this study. The result showed that approximately 62% of GDP is explained by variables in the model while 38% is accounted for and explained by other variables not included in the model but are captured by the error term. In addition, monetary policies did not have a significant impact on Nigeria’s economic growth in the short run, but significantly affected the country’s growth in the long run.

AB  - The impact of monetary policy changes on the monetary market and stock market in China is investigated in this study. The changes of two major monetary policies, the interest rate and required reserve ratio, are analyzed in a study period covering seven years on the interbank monetary market and Shanghai stock market. We find that the monetary market is related to the macro economy trend and we also find that the monetary change surprises both of lowering and raising bring significant impacts to the two markets and the two markets respond to the changes differently. The results suggest that the impact of fluctuations is much larger for raising policy changes than lowering changes in the monetary market on policy announcing and effective dates. This is consistent with the “sign effect”, i.e. bad news brings a greater impact than good news. By studying the event window of each policy change, we also find that the “sign effect” still exists before and after each change in the monetary market. A relatively larger fluctuation is observed before the event date, which indicates that the monetary market might have a certain ability to predict a potential monetary change, while it is kept secret by the central bank before official announcement. In the stock market, we investigate how the returns and spreads of the Shanghai stock market index respond to the monetary changes. Evidences suggest the stock market is influenced but in a different way than the monetary market. The climbing of returns after the event dates for the lowering policy agrees with the theory that lowering changes can provide a monetary supply to boost the market and drive the stock returns higher but with a delay of 2 to 3 trading days on average. While in the bear market, the lowering policy brings larger volatility to the market on average than the raising ones. These empirical findings are useful for policymakers to understand how monetary policy changes impact the monetary and stock markets especially in an emerging market like China where the economy is booming and the policy changes impact the markets as surprises by the central bank without a pre-decided schedule. This is totally different from previous studies on FED, which follows pre-decided schedules for monetary policy changes.

AB  - The paper empirically examines the redistributive effect of monetary policy and assesses whether financial development plays any role in shaping monetary policy — inequality relations in developing countries. We uncover evidence supporting the redistributive consequences of monetary policy especially in more financially developed countries. We further note that while financial development raises income inequality in countries with low financial development, it leads to a reduction in income inequality in high financial development countries. As a side result, economic growth contributes favorably to income equalization in these countries. Finally, such financial indicators as financial access, financial efficiency and financial stability also condition the impacts of monetary policy on income distribution, although they are independently insignificant. Our results hint that the improvements in information and in efficiency rather than depth and access that would attenuate the negative impacts of contractionary monetary policy on income distribution.

TI  - THE IMPACT OF MONETARY POLICY ON THE MACROECONOMIC PERFORMANCE IN SRI LANKA.
AU  - Lalani, J. M. G.
AB  - Central Bank of Sri Lanka sets price stability and economIc stability as its mam
monetary policy objective goal. Review of past empirical works reveals that no study
has examined the impact of monetary policy shocks on macroeconomic variables,
using a UVAR framework with context to Sri Lanka. This study attempts to identify
the various factors of monetary policy affect on macroeconomic performance in Sri
Lanka. Specific objectives are to examine the impact of monetary policy on economic
growth, inflation and to identify the solutions for mitigating the lack of
macroeconomic performance in Sri Lanka.To that end; researcher uses a five variable
unrestricted VAR model by utilizing quarterly time series data over the period 1978 2015
in order to focus on the impact on small open economy. Real Gross Domestic
Product and Colombo Consumer Price Index were used as non-policy variables.
Broad money supply, interbank call market rate and exchange rate were used as
potential monetary policy indicators. Impulse response functions and variance
decompositions are employed to capture the impact of monetary policy on the
economic growth and inflation. Impulse response for the model with average call
money market rate presents theoretically consistent results for output and inflation.
Broad money supply presents theoretically consistent with output and inflation only
for some periods. One standard deviation exchange rate appreciation has a positive
effect on output only for some periods which indicate theoretical inconsistency.
Negative impact on economic growth rate shows theoretical consistency of the
estimated results only for some periods. One standard deviation exchange rate
appreciation has a significant effect on reducing inflation, in 71h_1 Olh quarter following
the shock. A shock on economic growth rate, average call market rate and exchange
rate it will have 79%, 16% and 3% variation of the fluctuation in economic growth
rate. A shock to economic growth rate will have 96% of variation of the fluctuation in
the inflation rate. At 5% significant level price level, money supply, average call rate
and exchange rate can't jointly cause for econ2mic growth rate. Economic growth rate
and growth of money supply are most important variable of deciding inflation rate.
