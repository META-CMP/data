T2  - Economics of Sustainable Development
AB  - Domestic savings is a vital source of investment funds, especially for developing economies. It is thus essential that internal savings capacity in these economies is increased to enhance investment financing and economic growth. Since increased reliance on external capital flows can result in economic instability, achieving a higher national saving rate is a critical macroeconomic objective for many developing countries. However, domestic savings remain low in many of them including Kenya, posing a serious development challenge. Fiscal and monetary policies have been a major focus by governments in trying to improve on gross domestic saving. The main purpose of this study was to analyze the role of fiscal and monetary policy on gross domestic savings in Kenya. This study was informed by the theory of Life cycle hypothesis. The study utilized explanatory research design. Yearly time series data was sourced from Economic surveys, World Bank reports and Statistical abstract of the period between 1990 and 2017. The time frame was viewed as the economic reform period; this was started in the country in the 1990s. Johannes co-integration methods were applied together with its vector error correction estimation approach to determine coefficients that define the relationship between variables under study and the gross domestic savings. Augmented Dickey Fuller test was applied for unit-root test. The results obtained from the regressions were spurious free. The regression result revealed that monetary and fiscal policy variables explained domestic savings in Kenya. The study recommends that monetary and fiscal policy implemented by the government should promote a favorable investment atmosphere through appropriate stabilization of lending rates, inflationary rates, and promoting income growth to ensure increase in national savings for economic sustainability in Kenya.

T2  - The Journal of Economic Studies and Policies
AB  - In this paper we have analyzed the asymmetric effects of monetary policy on aggregate activity by applying co-integration analysis and error correction model using Iran’s annual data from 1971-2011. Three types of asymmetric effects have been considered in this paper: 1) whether negative and positive monetary policy shocks have different effects on output; 2) whether big or small shocks have different effects; and 3) whether low-variance, negative shocks have asymmetric effects on output. The results about asymmetry of positive and negative monetary shocks indicate that the negative shocks have more real effects on economic growth rate than positive shocks. In addition, for all specifications, a large part of the effects of positive shocks will become neutral in next period. Results show that in different specification in regard to null hypotheses of low-variance in negative monetary shocks have large effects on output. One can say that due to price rigidity and Menu cost theory when we have negative monetary shocks, firms will not adjust their prices and under this condition the shocks have positive effects on output

AB  - In this chapter, we examine the determinants of bank net interest margin, focusing on the effect of interest rates, and thus monetary policy decisions. The analysis is carried with a panel of banks from 32 OECD countries over the period 2003–2014. The results show a quadratic relationship between net interest margins and interest rates, implying that the variation of the latter has a greater effect when interest rates are low. An important policy implication of the results is that there is a trade-off between economic growth and financial stability associated with the impact of expansionary monetary policy when the level of interest rates is very low. As a result, if the current scenario of low and even negative interest rates persists for much longer in certain countries (such as in the Eurozone), it will have a negative effect on bank profitability and consequently on financial stability.

TI  - EBSCOhost | 160927986 | THE IMPACT OF MONETARY POLICY ON GREEN INNOVATION: GLOBAL EVIDENCE.
AB  - This research investigates and robustly verifies the impact of expansionary monetary policy actions on green innovation, conducted on a panel covering 133 countries from 1960 to 2018. Overall, we find that such actions have a significantly positive effect on green innovation performance, no matter in the static or dynamic model. A lower degree of central bank independence and poorer property rights protection in developing countries may hinder monetary policies' effect to be transmitted to green innovation activities smoothly. Moreover, stringent environmental regulation contributes to magnifying the expansionary monetary policy's positive effect on green innovation, but such a positive moderating effect should be supported by good national governance quality (including better control over corruption, higher efficiency of governments and a complete law system). Accordingly, several policy suggestions are provided.

We firstly investigate the determinants of bank behavior on their favor for excess liquidity both for precautionary motive and involuntary. Furthermore we determine the threshold between the low and high excess liquidity regimes. On the next step, this paper evaluates and compares the impact of excess liquidity on monetary policy between the two regimes. The first result shows that the excess liquidity on bank with their precautionary motive is significantly determined by the volatility of money demand, the volatility of economic growth, the bank cost of the bank, and also by the lag of excess liquidity, which conform its persistence. Secondly, using the Threshold-VAR approach, this paper shows the switching regime occurs in 2005 from low to high excess liquidity. Lastly, the excess liquidity reduces the effectiveness of monetary policy on controlling inflation

T2  - Land Use Policy
AB  - There is an anomaly of “the more regulation, the more rise” in China’s housing market before 2017. However, the anomaly seems to have reversed since 2017. To analyze the mechanism that leads to this transition, we construct a Dynamic Stochastic General Equilibrium (DSGE) model, including the public expectations about monetary policies. Before 2017, housing prices still rise due to the“tight-loose-tight…” regulatory policy, which leads the public to expect that tightening policies will not continue. However, since 2017, the government strengthens the consecutive tight policy, which leads to a continuous tight policy expectation like “tight-tight-tight…”. That’s the key to stabilizing China’s housing prices. The numerical analysis shows that the persistence of tight policies and the public’s expectations are the most important factors affecting China’s housing prices. As for China’s government, it is not only necessary to maintain the tightening policy but also to guide the public to form expectations of continuous tightening policy. As for the public, it is necessary to make investment decisions by judging the persistence of tight monetary policy.

AB  - Many nations and political bodies are struggling to define attitudes and policies towards immigrants and immigration for the 21st Century. This national and global debate usually revolves around economic impacts and the legal status of individual or groups of immigrants. It is significant to deal with an issue of immigrants´needs and also how people consider them, because it is very actual topic in times of globalization. Understanding immigrants´needs means bigger chance for being accepted to the society. Public opinion will become more favourable toward immigrants and more accepting of immigration as younger, more liberal and tolerant generations replace older ones. Elderly people rely more heavily on stereotypes and lack “the ability to inhibit information,” causing people to be more prejudiced than they would like to be. The aim of the paper is to evaluate the perception of immigrants´needs by 3 generations of people – Generation Y, Generation X and Baby Boomers.
Using the method – sentence completion, respondents from the Czech republic were asked, what they consider important for immigrants´ needs and which factors influencing their satisfaction. Obtained data were processed through a grounded theory method. Independent ttest was used to evaulate results. Immigrants’ needs for community services could pose new challenges for local governments. The results are broadly discussed.

The relationship between monetary policy channels and economic growth is influenced by many economic and non-economic factors that vary depending on countries' economic and political conditions. A key factor in Iran over the last four decades has been economic sanctions. According to the cause; The purpose of this study was to investigate the non-linear effects of the sanctions index on the relationship between monetary policy transmission channels and economic growth in Iran during the period 1391-1397 with a non-linear approach and using the NARDL method. The findings of this study showed that in the period under review, the exchange rate had a negative and significant effect on economic growth, which has become stronger with the introduction of sanctions in the model. Similar results were obtained for the bank credit variable, with the difference that bank credit has had a positive and significant effect on economic growth, strengthened by the sanctions index in the model. Other results also showed that interest rates had not had a significant effect on economic growth.

AB  - Monetary policy is a policy of Bank Indonesia aimed at managing a country's money supply in order to achieve certain objectives such as maintaining monetary stability and increasing employment opportunities.
The analysis of monetary policy in Indonesia aims to discover and anticipate the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on the Indonesian economy. Research uses descriptive qualitative research methods that include different concepts in the research process using content analysis techniques as well as literature search. The results of this study show the monetary policy efforts of the Indonesian government to stabilize the economic system, supported by Bank Indonesia through the role of the Financial Services Authority in Indonesia.
At that time, the Indonesian government tried to implement this policy to relieve the Indonesian nation of the economic crisis due to Pademi Covid 19, which has an even greater impact.

AB  - The slowdown in economic development caused by the reduction in the efficiency of the functioning of state institutions determined the focus of the governments of most countries of the world on achieving sustainable economic growth, as well as ensuring macroeconomic and macrofinancial stability. A major issue that is dealt with is the weakening of the interaction of monetary and fiscal policies in Ukraine. It can be assumed that one of the reasons hindering economic growth is growing discoordination between monetary and fiscal policies. The purpose of this study is to assess the nature of monetary and fiscal policies in Ukraine in 2000–2017 and justify the need for coordination between them to stimulate economic growth. For the quantitative assessment of the influence of monetary and fiscal factors on GDP, the models of autoregression with distributed lags – ARDL are used. The analysis makes it possible to distinguish and characterize three stages of combining the rigid and stimulating monetary and fiscal policy in Ukraine in 2000–2017. The article examines the influence of the dynamics of the monetary aggregate M3, the inflation rate and the weighted average base interest rate on the growth rates of real GDP in Ukraine, the impact of using the “monetary clamp” effect on the increase in the NBU’s interest rate, and the direct effect of monetary factors on the fiscal policy. The authors conclude that the inconsistency of monetary and fiscal policies is one of the reasons for the high volatility of macroeconomic indicators. The article substantiates the conclusion that it is necessary to overcome the increasing antagonism between monetary and fiscal policies in Ukraine and to strengthen their coordination.

T2  - Economic Inquiry
AB  - Central bankers and financial supervisors can have conflicting goals. While monetary policymakers work to ensure sufficient lending activities as a foundation for high and stable economic growth, supervisors may limit banks’ lending capacities in order to prevent excessive risk taking. We show that, in theory, central bankers can avoid this potential conflict by adopting an interest rate strategy that takes accounts of capital adequacy requirements. Empirical evidence suggests that while policymakers at the Federal Reserve have adjusted their interest rate to neutralizing the procyclical impact of bank capital requirements, those in Germany and Japan have not.

TI  - The impact of fiscal and monetary policy on economic growth in the SACU member economies between 1980 and 2017 : a panel ARDL approach
AU  - Monamodi, Nkosinathi Emmanuel
AB  - This study seeks to investigate the impact of fiscal and monetary policy on economic growth in Southern African Custom Union (SACU) member economies between 1980 and 2017. Government expenditure and revenue were used as the proxy variables for the fiscal policy whereas real interest rate, inflation, official exchange rate and M2 money supply were used as the proxy variables for monetary policy. Using Lin, Levin and Chu (LLC), and Im, Peresan and Shin (IPS) unit root tests, it was found that all variables were stationary at level except for M2 money supply which was found to be stationary after first difference. Due to this, Panel Auto Regression Distributed Lags (PARDL) estimation technique was utilized in this study.
Pooled Mean Group (PMG) PARDL model estimator was used in this study. The results indicate that fiscal and monetary policy influence economic growth significantly in the long run. However, fiscal policy is only significant if government expenditure is used as the functional policy instrument rather than government revenue. In the short run, the effects of these two macroeconomic policies on economic growth are mixed.
Granger causality results indicate that the direction government expenditure, real interest rate, inflation and official exchange rate Granger cause economic growth. These causality links are uni-directional in nature. Lastly, the results also indicate that private investment is crowded out in the long run because of significant high levels of government expenditure in the long run across SACU member economies. In the short run, private investment is crowded out because of significant high level of government expenditure only in Swaziland.
As some of the recommendations of this study, SACU member governments should redirect their public expenditures into investing more in human capital. Investing in human capital, among other factors can include empowering the active unemployed population with relevant skills that meet labor markets for easy employment. In that case, the tax revenues would increase which could play an important role in reducing government budget deficits. Furthermore, SACU member economies’ central banks can make monetary policy more effective by using monetary accommodation. Hence, when the governments apply expansionary fiscal policy, the central banks can increase money supply to avoid interest rates from increasing (monetizing budget deficit).

AB  - Monetary policy plays an important role in achieving sustained economic growth. Researchers have tried to examine various issues related to monetary policy in developed countries. Several studied have been carried out to identify the major determinant of stock of money. However, a little research has been conducted to analyze the level of stock of money by using the money multiplier approach. In Pakistan, monetary policy is designed to control total monetary assets keeping in view the projected growth rate of GDP, monetization of the economy and likely surplus or deficit in the country's external account. The objective of this paper is to ascertain the monetary policy in controlling the total monetary assets by analyzing the behaviour of the money multiplier. The findings of this study show that the monetary base remained an important determinant of the monetary stock (M2) and the monetary policy remained an effective instrument in controlling and regulating monetary assets in Pakistan.

TI  - Impediments of Investment and Impact of Monetary Policy to Drive Investment for Economic Growth in Bangladesh
AU  - Islam, Mohammad Saiful

AU  - Hossain, Mohammad
AB  - Economy of Bangladesh seems out of the wood with some
favorable macroeconomic and microeconomic indicators such as,
Moody’s rating of Ba3 (stable outlook) for last six consecutive years,
Fitch ratings of BB-(stable outlook) for second time, stable foreign
exchange rate, sufficient foreign exchange reserve, low cost external
borrowing, surplus in balance of payment, low fuel price in
international market, controlled inflation rate, less pressure in
government subsidy, declining lending interest rate ( however not in
a single digit yet), some recent mega projects implemented by
Government of Bangladesh etc. But, Bangladesh is not being able to
turn over a new leaf because of moving around 6 % GDP growth rate
over the last decade resulting from sluggish private sector investment
growth in the economy of Bangladesh. There are some road blocks
that can be responsible for sluggishness of investment growth in
Bangladesh such as high lending interest rate compared to other
Asian countries, political unrest, inadequate power (electricity, oil,
gas etc.) generation and supply, infrastructure problem, scarce land
availability, corruption in public and private organizations, illegal
transfer of investable funds abroad, lack of confidence on
government policies, high interest rate of government financial
instruments (National Savings Deposit) as safe source of alternative
investment etc. In this context, we have identified to what extent
above mentioned factors are responsible for investment sluggishness
in Bangladesh. Besides, we have observed how the tools of monetary
policy can be used effectively to accelerate investment for economic
growth in Bangladesh. This paper also investigates the impact of
monetary policy to drive investment growth in Bangladesh based on
the credit disbursement by financial institutions to the three major
sectors of GDP that includes agriculture, industry and service sector
against GDP of those particular sectors. We have developed
regression model to estimate the required level of loan disbursement
from financial institutions to achieve targeted level of GDP growth
rate of fiscal year 2015-16. All the primary and secondary data have
been analyzed using SPSS software. At the end of the paper, we have
recommended some measures to improve in each and every
impediments of investment and tools of monetary policy for ensuring
investment growth and achieving targeted economic growth in
Bangladesh.

TI  - Monetary policy objectives and economic outcomes: What can we learn from a wavelet-based optimal control approach?
AU  - Crowley, Patrick M.

T2  - The Manchester School
AB  - It has recently been widely recognized that monetary policy objectives change through time as our understanding of monetary policy and its impact on the macroeconomy evolves. In recent years there has been an extensive review of the framework for monetary policy at major central banks around the world, given the practical problems that have been encountered with inflation targets. This paper is a contribution to this debate, in that the aim of this paper is to evaluate the consequences of adopting different monetary policy objectives in the U.S. macroeconomic policy setting. To accomplish this, we first decompose U.S. macroeconomic data using a time-frequency domain technique, namely discrete wavelet analysis. We then model the behavior of the U.S. economy over each wavelet frequency range and use our estimated parameters to construct a tracking model. To illustrate the usefulness of this approach, we simulate jointly optimal fiscal and monetary policy with different short-term monetary targets: an inflation target, a money growth target, an interest rate target, and a real economic growth target. The results show that the most effective monetary policy targets to achieve economic growth are either inflation targets or economic growth targets.

AU  - Nwabueze, Okeke
AB  - One can hardly find a country without monetary policy. As a
matter of fact, monetary policy has gained a solid ground in
the Nigerian economy. However, in light of various economic
problems in Nigeria, it would seem the benefits of monetary
policy are yet to be fully harnessed. The purposed of this study
is to analyse the impact of monetary policy with Nigeria being
the case study. With regards to the data analysis, regression
analysis was applied. The study covers the effectiveness of
monetary policy from the period 1985 to 2011. The study
revealed that the level of effectiveness of monetary policy is
highly influenced by the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN).

T2  - Economics
AB  - This study explores the relative effectiveness of monetary and fiscal policies on economic growth in Bangladesh 
for the period from fiscal year 1974 to2015 employing cointegration and Vector Error Correction Model (VECM). We use nominal GDP as a proxy for economic growth, while broad money supply (M2) and reserve money (RM) as proxies for monetary policy. Total government revenue (TR) and total government expenditure (TE) are used as proxies for fiscal policy.
The Johansen cointegration tests reveal that monetary policy (M2 and RM) has a greater long run positive impact on economic growth over fiscal policy in Bangladesh. The results of VECM show that there is a weak long run causality running from monetary and fiscal policies to economic growth. VECM also finds that GDP, M2 and TR play a part to adjust any disequilibrium, while TR picks up the disequilibrium rapidly and guides the variables of the system back to equilibrium. VECM Granger causality/block exogeneity Wald test results show that M2 is the leading indicator with respect to economic growth in Bangladesh in the short run. Moreover, economic growth is a leading indicator with respect to fiscal policy in the short run. Thus, we conclude that monetary policy is the more effective channel than fiscal policy to promote economic growth
in the short run and long run in Bangladesh.

TI  - Inflation and Mexican economic growth: long‐run relation and threshold effects
AU  - Adrián Risso, W.
AU  - Sánchez Carrera, Edgar J.
T2  - Journal of Financial Economic Policy
AB  - Purpose – The purpose of this paper is to estimate the long‐run relationships and threshold effects between inflation and economic growth in Mexico. Design/methodology/approach – The paper shows the existence of such relationship in a cointegrated vector on economic growth (log of real gross domestic product (GDP)) and inflation rate finding a corresponding elasticity significantly negative. Moreover, the causal relationship between these two series is studied using a more robust Granger causality test, without finding any directional causality between them. Findings – The estimated threshold model suggests 9 percent as the threshold level (i.e. structural break point) of inflation above which inflation significantly slows the Mexican economic growth. Research limitations/implications – This paper uses the cointegration technique, and finds a significant and negative long‐run relationship between inflation and economic growth for the Mexican economy. In addition, it is found that inflation is weakly exogenous. In the period 1970‐2007 real GDP was elastic with respect to inflation, and therefore, considering the estimated coefficient, an increase of 1 percent on inflation produces a decrease of 1.5 percent on real GDP. Since, for most of the period under consideration Mexico experienced inflation rates higher than 10 percent, this result is consistent with most of the research suggesting that high levels of inflation produce a negative effect on economic growth. Practical implications – The analysis could be useful for policymakers in providing some clue in setting an optimal inflation target. For instance, the Mexican Central Bank could apply an expansionary monetary policy for supporting economic growth until the inflation rate does not exceed the threshold level. In fact, the threshold analysis suggests that if the inflation rate exceeds 9 percent, then Mexico's current favorable economic performance might be jeopardized. Originality/value – Specifically, this paper focuses on two questions: is there any long‐run relationship between economic growth and inflation in Mexico? Is there a statistically significant threshold level of inflation above which inflation affects growth differently than at lower inflation rates in Mexico? Motivated by these questions, this present paper first examines cointegration techniques and then, threshold estimations.

AB  - Monetary policy has an important role in a country's economy. The central bank plays a role in carrying out monetary policy for price stability through various mechanisms. This study aims to determine the contribution of conventional and Islamic monetary instruments to economic growth in Indonesia. This study uses time series data from January 2013 to December 2020 and is analyzed using the Vector Error Correction Model (VECM) method. From the results of the analysis that has been carried out, it can be seen that in the long run, interest rates, exchange rates, the Islamic Interbank Money Market (PUAS), and Bank Indonesia Sharia Certificates (SBIS) have a significant effect on economic growth. IRF results show that exchange rates react negatively to shocks from GDP over 48 periods. The FEVD results show that the interbank money market (PUAB) has the most significant contribution after GDP in explaining the 10 percent variability of economic growth.

AU  - de Bondt, Gabe
AB  - Empirical results for the euro area show that an important channel through which monetary policy – measured traditionally by the short-term interest rate as well as by the Eurosystem balance sheet total – affects economic growth is the confidence of borrowers as well as of lenders. Impulse responses and variance decompositions show that this channel is most effective via the short-term interest rate. Moreover, the state of confidence significantly matters for economic growth, particularly for investment (compared to private consumption) and for industry value added (compared to services). The findings are robust across adding other transmission variables, impulse definition, and other measures of monetary policy and confidence. The importance of a “feel good” factor among lenders provides new empirical evidence in the old debate that the situation of the financial sector does matter for growth.

Therefore, it was inevitable not to have countries' exports, imports and foreign trade affect from this. In this study, the effect of monetary policy determinants (economic growth, exchange rates, inflation, money supply, interest rate) in Brazil, Russia, India, China, South Africa and Turkey (BRICS-T) on export, is analyzed. In the study, quarter data were used for 1996q1-2018q2 period. According to causality analysis of Dumitrescu and Hurlin (2012), a bidirectional causality is found between economic growthexport, inflation-export, money supply-export and interest rate-export. However, one-way causality was found from exchange rate to exports.

However, since the central banks has the main task of stabilizing inflation and unemployment rate in normal level, so they have some of their policies in such a way that remain hidden from view of economic agents. This increases the uncertainty in monetary policy, which in turn can affect economic growth, inflation and unemployment. In this study, using quarterly data for the years 1372-90, the economic effects of uncertainty in monetary policy will be studied on economic growth, inflation and unemployment rates in Iran. The results suggest that the increase of uncertainty in monetary policy will be followed by increasing volatility in economic variables.

Regardless of the fact that both policies are independent in the implementation of their goals and apply different measures and instruments, they are not at odds in shaping economic policy, on the contrary, they complement each other and jointly contribute to ensuring macroeconomic stability and economic growth. In the Republic of Serbia, the joint effect of monetary and fiscal policy measures is reflected in the provision of macroeconomic and price stability and the reduction of public debt and a stable budget, which are key prerequisites for long-term economic growth.

T2  - Journal of Applied Economics
AB  - The freedom and growth literature has consistently shown that nations which have fewer restrictions on private agents and transactions tend to higher levels of economic growth. It is less clear, however, whether freedom causes growth, growth causes freedom, or the two are jointly determined. To assess these possibilities, Granger-causality tests are performed on annual freedom indicators developed by the Heritage Foundation and national growth rates. The underlying component indexes, which include Trade Policy, Taxation, Government Intervention, Monetary Policy, Capital Flows and Foreign Investment, Banking, Wage and Price Controls, Property Rights, Regulation, and Black Markets, are also tested in addition to the summary freedom rating. The tests suggest the average level of freedom in a nation, as well as many of the specific underlying components of freedom, precedes growth. However, growth may precede one of the component indexes (Government Intervention), and no relationship is found to exist between growth and two of the indexes (Trade Policy and Taxation).

AB  - Based on the BEKK model and the GARCH mean-value equation model, this paper analyzes the volatility correlations among real estate price, money supply and economic growth, and examines the impact of various volatilities on economic growth. It has been found out that the volatility of real estate price and the co-volatility between real estate price and money supply have significant impacts on GDP growth rate, and furthermore lead to decline of GDP growth rate. The volatility of real estate price growth rate does not significantly affect economic growth rate volatility, while the co-volatility between money supply and real estate price changes sharply, and the co-volatility between real estate growth rate and economic growth rate does not show significant influence on economic growth rate's volatility. The conclusion is that the volatility of real estate price should be controlled, but currently it is not necessary for the central bank to directly target on real estate price.

With the breakout of sub-prime loan crisis and the bursting of real estate price bubble, global economy goes to severe recession, and the research on relationship between asset price and monetary policy has become a hot issue. More and more central banks are recognizing the influences of asset price on inflation and economic growth.1 There is no doubt that the real estate price and the bursting of price “bubble” have a far-reaching implication on the monetary policy during the financial crisis.

The institutional quality factors were included as part of independent variables to bridge the gap between monetary policy and poverty reduction in Nigeria. The study used Error Correction Model (ECM) technique for the estimation, and the results show that there exists a strong link between monetary policy and poverty reduction. The findings also reveal that institutional quality, proxy by political and economic institutions, is among the major factors that influence poverty in Nigeria. The study concludes that monetary authority should implement low inflationary monetary policy that will not only encourage investment, raise employment opportunities and economic growth, but also improves wellbeing of the people in the country.

AB  - The paper considers the role and place of monetary policy in ensuring the reproduction of modern economy. Monetary policy conducted by the Bank of Russia is based on the IMF’s universal recommendations, which are inconsistent both with the conditions of reproduction of the Russian economy and with specific features of the current period of structural changes in the world economy. The ongoing change of technological and world economic orders is accompanied by fundamental changes in the composition of the industries that determine economic growth, as well as in the system of institutions for managing economic reproduction. The resulting opportunities for a breakthrough in the development of the Russian economy can be implemented only in conditions of an appropriate monetary policy focused on lending to promising areas of economic growth within the existing production factors. The goal of the present paper is to substantiate the mismatch between the monetary policy and the potential opportunities for the growth of the Russian economy in the conditions of changing technological and global economic orders. The paper criticizes the draft major directions of the unified state monetary policy for 2019 and for the period of 2020–2021 and proves that they are inconsistent with modern knowledge about the laws of economic development and growth opportunities of the Russian economy.

TI  - Macroeconomic and Monetary Policy Issues in Indonesia
AU  - Hossain, Akhand Akhtar
AB  - Following the acquisition of its sovereignty from the Netherlands in 1949, Indonesia experienced serious economic and political problems during the 1950s and 1960s, before entering a three-decade-long period of rapid economic growth. Hard-hit by the financial crisis of the late 1990s, Indonesia undertook a wide range of economic and financial reforms. These reforms served to prepare it well for the 2007-08 global financial crisis, through which Indonesia passed relatively unscathed.
Drawing on empirical research, this book presents a comprehensive empirical study on the key macroeconomic relations and monetary policy issues in Indonesia. The book analyses monetary, fiscal and exchange-rate policies, looking at their interactions and impacts on the economy. It demonstrates how important macroeconomic management for monetary and financial stability is to sustained national economic growth and development.
Data from the 1970s is compared and contrasted with 1950s data to analyse macroeconomic policies and issues in an historical context. Statistical and econometric techniques are juxtaposed with general empirical results to supplement informative discussion of macroeconomic and monetary developments. This book is a useful contribution to studies on macroeconomics and international development, as well as Southeast Asian studies.

AB  - Following record low interest rates and a depreciating US dollar, crude oil prices came under increasing pressure during the period 2003M5–2007M10. Oil price process parameters changed dramatically toward consistently rising prices. Short-term forecasting implied the persistence of the observed trend, as market fundamentals and underlying monetary policy were supportive of these trends. Market expectations derived from option prices anticipated further surge in oil prices and indicated a significant probability of right tail events. A tightening of monetary policy may be essential for restoring stability to oil markets and in turn for sustained economic growth.

AB  - The study examines the impact of monetary policy (proxied by money supply and interest rate) and tax revenue on foreign direct investment (FDI) in Jordan employing time series data period from 1991 to 2017. The Vector Error Correction Model (VECM), the Canonical Cointegrating Regression (CCR) and the Fully Modified Ordinary Least Squares (FMOLS) methods are applied in empirical estimations. Estimation results reveal that money supply has a positive and statistically significant impact on the FDI while, tax revenue has a negative impact on FDI in Jordan. Also, we find that the impact of interest rate is statistically insignificant.The results of current study are useful for the policymakers to formulate appropraite policies and support the literature for further researches in the case of developing economies.

AB  - In recent years, the effect of monetary policy on Macroeconomic Variables, and examining the role of central bank independence have been a challenging debate to which it has not produced any similar results in different studies. Accordingly, this study aims at examining the effect of the shock caused by monetary policy on macroeconomic variable considering the index of central bank independence. In this study, according to existing theoretical principles, we estimate Structural Vector Auto Regression (SVAR) which contain Monetary Policy Variables (legal reserve rate & interest rate), index of central bank independence, index of interest rate, inflation rate and oil price and use Impulse Response Function and Variance Decomposition for interpreting the results. In this order, we use Iran’s macroeconomic database from 1978 to 2016. This study came to a conclusion that the increase of legal reserve rate has, on the one side, meaningfully reduced economic growth rate, and, on the other side, central bank independence contributes to Variance Decomposition of inflation and economic growth rates. Additionally, central bank independence affects economic growth rate positively, and inflation rate negatively.

According to the monetary policy decisions of the Central Bank of China (Taiwan), maintaining price, financial stability and fostering economic growth are the ultimate goals of monetary policy during the empirical period. First, this article uses the cointegration tests to determine the operating targets, the intermediate targets and the ultimate goals of monetary policy. Then, a forward-looking aggregate demand–aggregate supply model for a small open economy is specified, and policy discretion is included in this model. Finally, the model is estimated by a linear state space model and is used to analyse the short-run effects of a systematic monetary change.

TI  - Exchange Rate Pass-Through in Emerging Market Economies: What Has Changed and Why?
AU  - Mihaljek, Dubravko

T2  - Bank for International Settlements Papers
AB  - through had been documented for the 1990s. However, the pass-through still seemed to be high: in countries with a history of high inflation, exchange rate changes were essentially fully passed into domestic CPI within a period of six months. For the great majority of emerging market countries, the period since 2001 has been much more successful in terms of overall macroeconomic performance than the 1990s. Many central banks have implemented significant changes in their monetary policy frameworks. In larger economies, exchange rates were in many cases freed and inflation targeting was introduced. In a number of smaller countries, hard peg regimes were introduced in order to anchor inflation expectations. Many emerging market economies have experienced a dramatic decline in inflation partly as a result of these changes. Inflation has also declined globally as international and domestic competition has intensified since the late 1990s. In this environment, one might expect to observe a further decline in the pass-through of exchange rate changes to domestic inflation. Against this background, this note provides estimates of the pass-through from exchange rate and foreign price changes to inflation for 14 emerging market countries for the period from 1994 to mid-2006. The main question addressed is whether the exchange rate pass- through has changed over time and, if so, what the likely determinants of this change have been. To verify whether the exchange rate pass-through has declined, estimates from this paper are compared with those for an earlier period (late 1980s to 2000) from Mihaljek and Klau (2001), using essentially the same data set and estimating framework. The paper also addresses some issues that have not been extensively analysed in the literature, such as the asymmetric and threshold effects of exchange rate changes on inflation, and the impact on the pass-through of the trend appreciation of real exchange rates in the catching-up economies. The paper is organised as follows. Section 1 discusses recent developments in the literature and presents central banks' assessments of the exchange rate pass-through, which were provided in answers to the questionnaire prepared for this meeting.

TI  - Effectiveness of the Easing of Monetary Policy in the Japanese Economy, incorporating Energy Prices
AU  - Yoshino, Naoyuki

T2  - Journal of Comparative Asian Development
AB  - Japan has reached the limits of conventional macroeconomic policies. In order to overcome deflation and achieve sustainable economic growth, the Bank of Japan (BOJ) recently set an inflation target of 2 per cent and implemented an aggressive monetary policy so this target could be achieved as soon as possible. Although prices started to rise after the BOJ implemented monetary easing, this may have been for other reasons, such as higher energy prices as a result of the depreciated Japanese yen. This paper shows that quantitative easing may not be able to stimulate the Japanese economy. Aggregate demand, which includes private investment, did not increase significantly in Japan with lower interest rates. Private investment displays this unconventional behaviour because of the uncertainty about the future and because Japan's population is ageing. The paper concludes that the remedy for Japan's economic policy is not to be found in its monetary policy.

TI  - IMPACT OF MONETARY POLICY AND MACROECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT ON ISLAMIC BANKING OPERATIONS IN A DUAL BANKING SYSTEM OF MALAYSIA
AU  - MULKIAMAN, MOHAMMED
AB  - The emergence of Islamic banking and finance since 1984 had contributed to the financial development leading to economic growth in Malaysia. Since Islamic banks operates within the dual banking system in Malaysia, it is inevitable that Islamic banking operations have interacted with the monetary policies and outcomes of the existing (conventional) system and as a result interact with interest rate related developments as well. In addition, macroeconomic interaction in the sense of Islamic banking contributing to economic growth will be higher if Islamic banks grow and increase their market share in the industry perhaps through applying legitimate Islamic compliance products and valid contracts. 
This research, hence, aims to assess the impact of monetary policy as well as macroeconomic outcomes on Islamic banking operations and vice versa in the case of Malaysia in particular in the post-1990 period. In doing so, each research question is examined and answered in three separate yet connected empirical papers. Each econometric analysis is based on two steps Engle-Granger tests with different timelines and sampling due to availability of the data. The main tests conducted was two steps Engle-Granger approach which involved Ordinary Least Square estimation, Residual testing, and Cointegration test. Vector Error Correction Model and Granger Casusality were also employed for further investigation of the long and short-run relationship between variables.
The finding indicates that the Islamic banks do have long run dynamic relationship with economic growth. However, the conventional banks are the dominion due to small market share of the Islamic banks which is less than 30 per cent. 
With regards to the interest rate interaction, both conventional and Islamic interbank money market rates moving closely in the long run statistically indicates that Islamic inter-bank money market is co-integrated in long-run because both conventional and Islamic banks are subjected to the same monetary policy. While saving interest rates of the conventional banks and profit rates of the Islamic banks are not associated but moving parallel need to adjust their return rates in the long short and long run either slightly higher or lower to remain competitive in the market. 
The findings on the relationship between Islamic banks saving profit rates spread show that they are affected by financial factors such as inflation rate and real interest rate. This indicates that Islamic banks are exposed to the interest rates risk, as they operate under the dual banking system and reign by the same monetary policies.
The results indicate that there is a close and inevitable interaction between Islamic banking operations and monetary policy outcomes. In particular close operational relationship between Islamic banking profit rates and interest rates should be considered as a source of worry in the face of the religious positioning of the prohibition of interest rate. The outcome reflects that prohibition of riba is only considered as the form nature of Islamic law (Shari’ah), while the operations of Islamic banks are vulnerable to interest rates risk in everyday life.  However, in dual banking system such interactions will be inevitable.

TI  - Threshold Cointegration Approach for Assessing the Impact of US Economic Policy Uncertainty on Monetary Policy Decision of African Countries
AU  - Ltd, ICB-InterConsult Bulgaria
T2  - Scientific Annals of Economics and Business
AB  - This study uses threshold cointegration technique to ascertain the relationship between United States (US) economic policy uncertainty (EPU) and monetary policy rate (MPR) of each of the four African countries, namely Egypt, Ghana, Namibia and South Africa using monthly data from March 1998 to April 2020. The impact of US EPU on MPR of each country is assessed by examining the linear cointegration, asymmetric cointegration and causal relationships in the frequency domain between the US EPU and MPR of each African country. The findings provide evidence of long-run threshold cointegration and the adjustment mechanisms towards long-run equilibrium are asymmetric in the short run for the MPR models for Ghana, Namibia and South Africa in the M-TAR specification except for Egypt’s MPR model which does not provide evidence of asymmetric adjustment towards the equilibrium position. The bivariate analysis performed in the spectral frequency domain suggests unidirectional causality between US EPU and MPR of each country and that, the US EPU influences the MPR of each country in the long run. The findings provide important guidelines to monetary policy reviewers to take policy stance that would stimulate economic growth amid US policy uncertainties.

The model is calibrated to the U.S. economy. We find that the monetary policy has no effect on firm-size growth, but a negative impact on economic growth, real interest rate, skill premium, R&D intensity, and welfare; positive influence on the velocity of money. The sign of the theoretical relationships is in line with the dominant empirical evidence.

TI  - Inflation targeting monetary policy and economic growth in Ghana
AU  - Yartel, Emmanuel Nana
AB  - This study investigated the relationship of inflation targeting monetary policy and economic growth in Ghana. Inflation rate was measured by conditional variance generated by fitting an empirical Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Hetroskedasticity (GARCH) model to seasonally adjust annual consumer price inflation for the period 1960-2015. The inflation rate measure, together with macroeconomic control variables, was used to estimate economic growth models for two periods corresponding to two monetary policy regimes and a third period covering the full sample. The first period corresponds to the pre-inflation targeting regime covering 1960-2002. During this period, Ghana had adopted various monetary policy frameworks including exchange-rate targeting, discretionary monetary policy, monetary-aggregate targeting and an eclectic approach. This period was largely characterized by high inflation rate. The inflation rate in turn had significant negative impact on economic growth during this period. Nonetheless, inflation rate did not have any statistically significant impact on real economic growth during the inflation targeting monetary policy period, i.e. 2003-2015. The empirical results for the combined growth model were consistent with the findings for the two periods. The implication of this is that by adopting the inflation targeting monetary policy framework since 2003, Ghana has to some extent succeeded in achieving low and stable general price level thereby creating a conducive environment for economic growth. The government may introduce some structural reforms to unlock the economic growth potentials in the country.

TI  - Impact of Monetary Policy on Capital Inflows in Nigeria
AU  - Nwokoye, Ebele S.
AU  - Oniore, Jonathan O.
T2  - Business, Management and Economics Research
AB  - Foreign capital flows depends on the prevailing monetary forces as supported by capital flows theory and the mechanism linking these two variables is that contraction of net domestic assets through an open market sale of bonds will place upward pressure on domestic interest rates. Higher interest rates attract foreign funds, generating a capital inflow which relieves the pressure on domestic interest rates. Has this actually happened? It is against this backdrop that the present study investigated the impact of monetary policy on international capital inflows in Nigeria for a period of 22 years (1994-2015) using time series data. The autoregressive distributed lag technique revealed that the short-run and long-run significant determinants of foreign capital inflows are largely from broad money supply, nominal exchange rate, inflation rate and interest rates spread except inflation rate that is insignificant in the long-run. This outcome upholds theoretical prediction. Long-run equilibrium relationship was found between the dependent variable and the regressors. Further examination of the short run dynamics of the model showed that the speed of adjustment coefficients ECM (-1) to restore equilibrium have a negative sign and statistically significant at 1% level, ensuring that long-run equilibrium can be attained and about 89% of the short-run deviation from the equilibrium (long-run) position is corrected annually to maintain the equilibrium. Since the empirical evidence revealed that monetary aggregates such as broad money supply, nominal exchange rate, inflation rate and interest rates spread influence foreign capital inflows, it is therefore recommended that government should continue to pursue expansionary monetary policy and foreign exchange policies that would ensure competitiveness of the economy in order to attract the much needed foreign capital inflows that would engender economic growth.

AB  - The translation of legal independence into actual independence is primarily determined by the rule of law. Inspired by the economic growth literature, where the role of institutions already is incorporated, we introduce Institutional Quality Indicators that can be used as reasonable proxies for the rule of law in a country. This idea can be seen as an important extension of the existing empirical research about the relationship between inflation and the institutional design of monetary institutions. With the rule of law factor we will get a better expression of effective central bank independence. Transition economies like former socialist economies in Europe are interesting candidates for the examination of the relationship between the rate of inflation, central bank reforms and the transition process. Legal Transition Indicators will be used as proxy for the rule of law in these countries. The liberalization process seems to be an important condition for the effectiveness of legal central bank independence. With the Cumulative Liberalization Index we incorporate the liberalization process into our analysis.

TI  - Monetary Policy Shocks and Economic Growth in Morocco: A Factor-Augmented Vector Autoregression (FAVAR) Approach
AU  - Daoui, Marouane
AU  - Benyacoub, Bouchra
T2  - IOSR Journal of Economics and Finance
AB  - In response to the empirical anomalies relating to the use of VAR models in analysing the impact of monetary policy shocks, the Factor-Augmented VAR (FAVAR) models attempt to provide a practical solution. Moreover, these models, based on dynamic factor models (DFM), make it possible to summarize the information present in a large database into a small number of factors common to all the variables. In this paper, we analyse the effects of monetary policy shocks on economic growth using the FAVAR model on a large number of Moroccan macroeconomic time series (117 quarterly time series from 1985Q1 to 2018Q4). First, we present the econometric framework of the FAVAR model, then the data used and their necessary transformations. Next, we determine the number of factors before estimating the model. Then, we focus on the analysis of the impulse response functions of some indicators of economic growth in Morocco. The results of the analysis indicate that, the overall decline in GDP in response to monetary policy shocks suggests that they have a clearly negative impact on economic growth.

TI  - Tax Policy and Economic Growth: Lessons from the 1980s
AU  - Boskin, Michael J.
T2  - Journal of Economic Perspectives
AB  - The past seven years of U.S. economic policy and performance constitute a truly remarkable, if confusing, experiment. Few would have guessed in 1980 that inflation would fall rapidly to 4 percent and hold pretty steady during a lengthy recovery; that productivity growth would partially rebound, the national debt more than double, capital imports reach $150 billion in a single year; or that employment would continue to expand at rates envied by other advanced economies. Perhaps fewer still would have predicted two major and two minor tax reforms would be passed in six years, a flip-flop in depreciation schedules, and a top personal tax rate below 30 percent. While it is always easier to draw inferences concerning economic growth, its determinants, and policies affecting the determinants with long historical hindsight, this paper will attempt to provide information, evaluation, and conjecture to draw some tentative lessons about the effects of tax policies in the 1980s on long-run economic growth.

A2  - Dr Scott Beyer, Dr Gerry Jensen and Dr Robert Johnson
AB  - Purpose In the increasingly globalized economy, foreign exchange fluctuations have multiple, conflicting effects on domestic stock prices. The purpose of this paper is to examine return data to determine the relation between the dollar’s value and stock prices as it relates to monetary policy. Design/methodology/approach The authors examine US stock returns over a 40-year period, which is classified according to monetary policy and dollar trend. To better understand the impact of foreign exchange fluctuations, the authors estimate a model of stock returns using the three Fama-French factors and a momentum factor. Then the authors explore the underlying economic fundamentals that drive the sharp difference in annual returns between periods when the dollar is in an uptrend trend with loose monetary policy and periods when the dollar is in a downtrend with tight monetary policy. Findings Over the last 40 years, US stock returns were 2.5 times higher when the dollar was trending up vs down. The factor model of returns shows that equity returns are positively associated with periods when the dollar appreciated. Returns were particularly high when the dollar was in an uptrend during accommodative monetary policy. During these periods, stocks in the consumer goods and services industries provided relatively high returns. This occurred with strong economic growth due to consumer spending. Stocks exhibited the lowest returns when the dollar was depreciating and the Federal Reserve was tightening. Originality/value The key contribution of the research is that currency trends should be analyzed in the light of monetary policy. During periods of accommodative monetary policy and dollar appreciation, the US stock market provided average returns of 18.7 percent compared to −3.29 percent during a period of restrictive monetary policy and dollar depreciation. This result is driven by stronger economic growth, which is composed of consumer spending that more than offsets the dollar’s impact on net exports.

AU  - Turkeshi, Neritan
T2  - KNOWLEDGE - International Journal
AB  - Upon the monetary independence of the country from the previous joined state, it began with the creation (construction) of new own monetary system and implement its own authentic monetary policy. Besides the implementation of the projected primary monetary objectives (maintenance of price stability and stability of the purchasing power of money, i.e. internal and external value of the denar), the monetary authority cares for the realization of other basic goals of macroeconomic policy, such as: providing a higher rate of economic growth, increased foreign trade, especially exports, increasing the employment and improving the balance of payments positions. The realization of these macroeconomic objectives is possible if, with the measures of macroeconomic policy, and in this framework, monetary policy measures, are created the: favorable conditions for management(expansion of production capabilities, better utilization of available resources, adequate location and prompt reallocation of resources), improving economic relations and trade cooperation, aimed at increasing foreign trade, especially exports and improve the current account positions, and thus the position of the balance of payments.

TI  - Higher economic growth through macroeconomic policy coordination? The combination of wage policy and monetary policy
AU  - Gern, Klaus-Jürgen
AU  - Meier, Carsten-Patrick
AU  - Scheide, Joachim
AB  - Strengthening potential output is high on the agenda for economic policy in the European Union. While there is widespread agreement that structural policies have a positive impact on long-term growth, there is a controversial discussion whether coordination of macroeconomic policies can contribute to this goal. Against the background of the new economic conditions in the euro area, we analyze what could be gained from a combination of wage policy and monetary policy. Using a small theoretical macroeconomic model, we show that coordination between wage policy and monetary policy can be beneficial under certain assumptions. A policy of sustained wage moderation results in an increase in employment and potential output. Assuming that expectations are not completely forward-looking and prices are sticky, the upward shift in potential output will not be matched by a similar increase in aggregate demand. To prevent an output gap from emerging, the optimal monetary policy is to lower interest rates. However, a central bank aiming at price stability will only do so when the announcement of a policy of sustained wage moderation is credible. Simulations with a large macroeconometric multicountry model confirm that a coordination of German wage policy and ECB monetary policy would help to realize the beneficial effects of wage moderation somewhat faster, although the quantitative effect is relatively small. The long-run gain in employment would accrue regardless of a coordination with monetary policy. According to the simulations, employment in Germany would increase by about 750,000 persons in the long run if wages increase one percentage point slower than usual over a period of five years. Frequently, countries with a particularly positive economic development are said to have benefited from a coordination of macroeconomic policies. However, only a small part of the growth and employment success in these countries can be accounted for such a coordination. In the case of the United States, it is hard to see any evidence of ex ante policy coordination at all. In the Netherlands and in Ireland, a consensual strategy of wage restraint for improving the competitiveness of the economy and stimulating employment has been a significant factor of the economic success. It was important in both cases that significant supply side reforms were implemented by the governments at the same time, whereas monetary policy played no active role. Coordination of macro policies is severely complicated by the pronounced differences in national wage bargaining systems. The systems would have to be harmonized and centralized to create a single European wage policy. It is, however, unlikely that centrally designed harmonization of labor market institutions in the EU can cope with the differences across Euroland regarding productivity and employment. In the framework of the European Union, the presumed positive effects of policy coordination are stressed over and over again, for example in the Broad Economic Policy Guidelines. However, clear definitions and mechanisms how such a coordination can be achieved are missing. The fundamental difficulty concerning a coordination between wage policy and monetary policy arises from two facts: First, there is no such thing as “the” wage policy at the European level. Second, the statute of the ECB does not allow a binding commitment by the central bank. This does not mean, however, that the ECB would not take account of what is happening, for example, to wage developments. According to the monetary policy strategy, it should react if there is an increase in the growth rate of potential output as a result of wage moderation. For example: If the social partners in a large country such as Germany give a credible signal that wage increases will be moderate for several years, the ECB could accommodate this change. However, such a strategy cannot be reversed in that the ECB moves first hoping that wage moderation will follow.

T2  - Economic Analysis and Policy
AB  - China has experienced rapid economic growth in recent decades. The benefits of economic growth are indisputable. However, risks are also generated that can jeopardize the sustainability of economic progress. Real estate bubbles, for example. The rapidly soaring house prices are one of the severe challenges in China in recent years. The real estate tax, monetary policy, and macro-prudential policy are the three main measures of the Chinese government to stabilize house prices. This paper studies the topic of which policy or policy portfolio can be an effective long-run mechanism of house price regulation by incorporating the real estate sector into the Dynamic stochastic general equilibrium (DSGE) model. Three important conclusions are drawn from the numerical simulation analysis based on the data of China. First, employing any policy portfolio can mitigate the fluctuation of house prices more effectively and decrease the loss of social welfare relatively compared to implementing a single policy. Second, the long-run regulating effect of the policy portfolio of monetary policy and macro-prudential policy can suppress the fluctuation of house prices in China while minimizing social welfare loss. Third, whether the real estate tax is combined with monetary policy or macro-prudential policy, the long-run regulating effect is insignificant. The real estate tax cannot be used to regulate house prices in China.

TI  - How to Improve the Effectiveness of Monetary Policy in the West African Economic and Monetary Union
AU  - Kireyev, Mr Alexei
AB  - The West African Economic and Monetary Union (WAEMU) is a currency union with a fixed exchange rate and limited capital mobility and, therefore, an independent monetary policy in the short run. The Central Bank of West African States (BCEAO) is conducting the single monetary policy with the main goal of preserving price stability and supporting economic growth. However, the effectiveness of its monetary policy remains low, with a weak reaction of market interest rates and inflation to BCEAO’s policy actions. The paper concludes that, while the institutional setup and the instruments of monetary policy are adequate, the transmission mechanism of monetary policy remains constrained by liquidity management practices, shallow and segmented financial markets, and interest rate rigidities. To improve the effectiveness of monetary policy the BCEAO should be more proactive in determining the stance of fiscal policies, develop financial markets, and liberalize controlled interest rates. The BCEAO is undertaking important reforms in these directions.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic affected global economic growth, including Indonesia's economic recession for four quarters from Q2 2020 to Q1 2021. This study uses Schumpeter's growth theory to analyze the interest rate policies and innovations that encourage economic growth in Indonesia in the long term. This study uses a quantitative approach with the Auto Regressive Distributed Lag (ARDL) model with the variables of GDP, BI interest rates, consumption, innovation, and investment credit. The study results show that Bank Indonesia's accommodative interest rate policy with low-interest rates during the recession due to the Covid-19 pandemic positively influences economic growth. However, in the long-term, interest rates must compete with interest rates from other countries to encourage investment capital flows to Indonesia. The findings show that innovation has not yet affected economic growth in Indonesia, but economic growth fosters innovation to accelerate technology transfer from developed countries through foreign investment. Therefore, the support of the Government and Bank of Indonesia to provide incentives through tax breaks and low-interest rates to business actors developing R&amp;D and innovation will encourage accelerating technology and innovation growth in Indonesia.

AB  - This article examines the role of the banking channel in transmitting Russia’s monetary policy. As the financial market is forming and data samples are increasing, there are emerging new conditions for getting a deeper insight into various aspects of monetary policy conducted by the Bank of Russia. The article explores the dependence of bank lending on monetary policy. The author tries to establish whether there are causal statistically significant instruments of monetary policy for the volumes of corporate lending. As independent variables, the author investigates the impact of the monetary base, the money supply, the refinancing rate, and the interbank lending rate. The assessment was conducted using the generalized method of moments. Based on a quarterly sample of data from 2002 to 2013, the author establishes the statistically significant impact of the money supply, the monetary base, the interbank lending rate, and the refinancing rate. The resulting empirical findings substantiate the hypothesis about the existence of a bank lending channel in Russia.

AB  - This paper critically examines the dynamic interaction between monetary policy tools in stimulating economic growth, as well as stabilizing the economy from external shocks in Nigeria. The paper considered key monetary time series variables and real growth of output in formulating Vector Autoregressive (VAR) models which showed interdependence interaction between the period of 1970 and 2007. The time series properties of the selected variables are examined using the Augmented Dickey-Fuller unit root test and the results revealed that only growth of real output and broad money supply are stationary at levels, while saving, lending and exchange rates were found stationary at first difference. The long-run dynamic interaction was established through the Johansen’s Trace and Maximum Eigenvalue tests. The pair-wise Granger-Causality test conducted showed that the growth rate of real output is not a leading indicator for any monetary variables. Other innovation accounting tests were also carried out like impulse responses function to test for the response of growth in real output to innovation shock on monetary variables. Also, the forecast error variance decomposition (FEVD) is used to decompose the monetary shock on the growth rate of real output in Nigeria. Proper policy recommendations were proffered based on the results emanated from the econometric analyses.

AB  - ABSTRACT: This study investigates the dynamic impact of broad money supply (m3) on economic growth (GDP) per capita in South Africa using time-series data from 1980 to 2016. The study has employed the autoregressive distributed lag (ARDL)-bounds testing approach to cointegration and error correction model to investigate the impact of m3 on GDP per capita. The model is specified with four macroeconomics variables, namely, Gross Domestic Product (GDP) per capita, Broad money supply (M3), Interest rate (INT), Inflation rate (INF). The findings reveal that there is statistically significant positive relationship between money supply and economic growth both in short run and long run. The government of South Africa should maintain consistency and follow “the Taylor  rule” to allow money supply to increase at a steady rate keeping pace with the economic growth. In respect to such rule will help South Africa Reserve Bank to avoid the inefficiencies that caused by execution of discretionary policy.

But with the new fiscal policy, it will be able to face up to the first priority of monetary policy, namely, a cut in the rate of inflation. Such a policy will undoubtedly involve a substantially slower rate of growth in real output, and the path from here on will not be smooth.

The study employed descriptive approach to the study with data sourced from the Central Bank of Nigeria Statistical Bulletin of various issues. Previous study was also consulted to enrich the work. The most salient observations from the study include first: all the countries that adopted inflation targeting recorded a reduced inflation figure and improved economic growth after adopting inflation targeting than before the adoption. Second, Nigeria is absent from the list of countries that have adopted inflation targeting as a monetary policy framework, while South Africa and Ghana are the only countries in Africa that have adopted inflation targeting. Based on the observations some recommendations were made, mostly the need for the monetary authorities in Nigeria to adopt and implement fully the framework considering the harmful and suicidal effect of inflation on economic growth and investment on the economy.

Securities and the endogeneity aspect of the money supply are explicitly introduced. This paper shows that the steady state under optimal growth is a saddle point, that the dynamic behavior of the capital-labor ratio and real per capita consumption is identical to that found in the usual literature in which money is not introduced, and that the optimal monetary policy is “counter-cyclical.”

Monetary policy plays an increasingly important role in China’s economy. With the Chinese economy in rapid development, the country’s tourism market experienced significant growth. This study uses the Granger Causality test and factor-augmented vector auto-regression (FAVAR) model to identify the effects of monetary policy on China’s tourism market through four transmission mechanism channels. Our results show that macroeconomic growth promotes China’s tourism market development. Moreover, the money supply channel, exchange rate channel, and other assets channel have significant and adverse effects on China’s tourism market development.

AB  - This study examines the impact of United States monetary policies on domestic mortgage rates, incorporating a holistic set of macroeconomic variables in its analysis. Two obstacles have prevented this integration in the past: the data gap in the federal funds rate during the zero lower bound (ZLB) period; and the utilization of a single equation rather than a system of equations to model the relationship between the mortgage rate and its determinants. First, we establish that the shadow federal funds rate introduced by Wu and Xia (2015) is a valid proxy for monetary policy during the ZLB period, and we use dimensionality reduction to create proxy variables for important macroeconomic measures. Second, we utilize the generalized impulse response approach to measure in level and first difference the impact of monetary policy and the macroeconomic environment on the long-term mortgage rate. Generally, the effect of macroeconomic variables outweighs that of monetary policy. In addition, omitting macroeconomics variables overestimates the impact of monetary policy on the mortgage rate in level and first difference. For example, shocking the first difference (level) of the federal funds rate by one standard deviation overestimates the impulse responses by 15% (51%) and the variance decompositions by 27% (37%). The current research implies that a noticeable increase in the mortgage rate is associated with an economic environment characterized both by tightening monetary policy and strong economic growth. Further, the impact of monetary tightening on the mortgage rate is expected to weaken if secular stagnation continues to prevail.

TI  - Impact Of Monetary Policy on Bank loan - A Case study of Mercantile Bank
AU  - Sumaiya, Hasem
AB  - The implication of a range of factors on the bank's credit channel of the monetary policy transmission was investigated in this study. One of the most important tools that the government uses to manage the economy is monetary policy. As little more than a result, understanding the trends in the area is a critical topic in economic research. Since the 1990s, Bangladesh's monetary policy objectives, and also the instruments and operational mechanisms for implementing them, have started to experience substantial improvements, have included those of other governments throughout the world. Even though maintaining economic stability (inflation) and stimulating economic growth have traditionally been recognized as essential requirements of the Bangladesh Bank's (BB) monetary policy, consecutive economic downturns in the global economy have changed dramatically Bangladesh's conventional monetary policy strategy. The conclusions of this research which was based on yearly data from the Mercantile Bank’s loan Department (2017-202) and Bangladesh’s monetary policy statement (2017-2021) shows that the lending is affected by changes in the interest rates of the quantitative measures of monetary policy. This research, on the other hand, shows how the loan channel works inside the market system. The impact of monetary policy on bank lending is influenced by the market power. For the banking industry, the findings have significant policy consequences. Although more competition grows angst about economic stability, more market power has a negative relationship with the bank lending and monetary policy transmission in these scenarios. Such findings might support counter banking strategies as a method of accomplishing the intended monetary policy aim. As a result, credit market inefficiencies in our model only account for a small amount of amplification and propagation of genuine monetary policy shocks.

AB  - The purpose of the article is to identify actual condition and recent changes in monetary policy of the Bank of Russia. The article considers the main directions of the monetary policy of the Bank of Russia, especially in correspondence with Russia’s deep political and economic problems. The author underlines negative aspects of the Bank of Russia’s monetary policy that took place in 2014. The attention is focused on consequences of inflation targeting policy influence on the economy, and on the use of monetary control instruments at the level of bank lending, rates of economic growth, etc. The research conducted by the author is based on dynamicsof macroeconomic indicators. The author makes the conclusion that there is a change of the Bank of Russia’s monetary policy paradigm, which tends to correspond with the purposes of economic growth. The author also offers possible directions of improving Russia’s monetary policy, including double-purpose, which, in the author’s opinion, is of paramount importance at the present stage of Russia’s economy development under the conditions of economic and political instability, crisis and shocks.

AB  - In the article I discuss some possible explanations for two features of financial globalization over recent years; first, the fact that expected returns have fallen significantly in advanced countries, even though economic growth has accelerated; and second, the fact that capital is flowing from poor to rich countries rather than the other way round, a phenomenon known in the literature as the “Lucas Paradox”. The “incomplete” nature of globalization, notably the persistent differences in institutional quality between North and South, might explain both puzzles as well as the emergence of global imbalances. Alternative explanations based on a fall in risk premia and accommodative monetary policy conditions fit the facts less well. I then discuss the implications for monetary policy.

AB  - In evaluation of countries’ economic performance and policy, Some macroeconomic indicators plays a key role due to its impact on other macroeconomic variables. Employment, income distribution, price level, consumption and investment are very important economic variables that are affected by economic growth. Therefore, one of the most important goals of economic policies is to achieve a stable high economic growth rate. Because of that, recognizing the factors that determine the effect of monetary policy on economic growth, makes it possible for policy makers to plan for increasing the economic growth. The aim of this study is to examine the financial development and the impact of globalization on influence of monetary policies on GDP. For this purpose, data of 34 high-income countries for 2000-2014 and Auto Generation Vector Panel Model have been used. This study showed that Despite of openness the reaction of GDP to the impact of monetary policy is positive. In other words, monetary policy with trade openness leads to an increasing in GDP trend. one of the policy proposals of this study is trade liberalization by removing tariffs and Import restrictions.

AB  - Based on the analysis of monetary history since medieval public deposit and settlement banks to the present, the article reveals the logic of the formation of public demands on monetary policy and monetary authorities' responses for them. As the time interval under consideration covers periods of states building and defence, economic turmoil and deep institutional changes, the findings on the optimal monetary policy differ from those offered by foreign experts often based on analysis of Â«best practicesÂ» for specific period of 1990th - early 2000th. It has been founded that monetary policy has always been a part of economic strategy, of some model of economic growth and ultimately of social contract. It has been shown that the legitimization of monetary policy by society and the formation of its credibility are carried out by a number of criteria: stability of the national currency, economic growth, full employment, financial stability and justice (assessment of credit availability and distribution effects of monetary policy). The features of the future monetary policy regime growing within the existing monetary regimes have been highlighted. The basic problems and contradictions of monetary regime in Ukraine have been revealed and the ways for its correction have been shown.

AB  - The easing monetary policy after the global financial crisis triggered wide concerns on the responses of income inequality. In this paper, we investigate impact of monetary policy shocks on income inequality. We propose a general equilibrium model and show that monetary policies could affect income inequality by affecting the earnings of high-income households in financial markets and business operations. Using a TVP-FAVAR model, we find contradictory distributional effects of monetary policy shocks in China and the US. Specifically, expansionary monetary policy shocks persistently increase income inequality in China but decrease income inequality in the US. Moreover, the impacts are volatile in the short-term, but stabilise after 10 periods. The investigation on the responses of top 1% and bottom 50% income share confirms the finding of contradictory distributional effects of monetary policy shocks.

AB  - This paper examines, through the concept of mutual information based on Shannon’s entropy, the impact of monetary policy on the loss of efficiency in the financial markets due to speculative bubbles. The proposed information measure is useful to quantify the efficiency with which stock markets respond to the implementation of monetary policy. The findings show that an increase in both money supply and credit growth, as well as declining interest rates, lead to strong market inefficiencies during the initial periods of formation of a bubble. Moreover, empirical evidence suggests that when a loose monetary policy (money supply is expanded and is accessible to agents to encourage economic growth) generates inefficiencies, its instruments are not effective to realign the performance of financial markets.

AB  - To examine the effect of monetary policy on economic growth, we formulate an endogenous growth model with cash-in-advance constraints on R&D and capital accumulation as endogenous growth engines. Within this framework, we show that the relationship between economic growth and the nominal interest rate can be an inverted-U shape. Moreover, we demonstrate that the welfare-maximizing level of the nominal interest rate is larger than the growth rate-maximizing level of the nominal interest rate.

TI  - Monetary policy and economic performance - evidence from selected African countries
AU  - Fiador, Vera Ogeh Lassey
AB  - The main aim of this dissertation is to broaden the understanding of the monetary policy transmission mechanism as it operates in Sub-Saharan Africa. The ultimate goal is to aid in the appropriate design and implementation of monetary policy for the attainment of developmental goals. The dissertation empirically explores four issues on the pricing, behavioural and output implications of monetary policy. The four questions that the dissertation attempts to answer in Chapters Two to Five respectively are: 1) Does the effectiveness of monetary policy transmission depend on the financial development of an economy? 2) Can monetary policy be used as a tool in easing pressure on domestic currencies in the foreign exchange market? 3) Do banks engage in excessively risky behaviour when monetary policy is expansionary? 4) Does monetary policy influence aggregate variables like private capital formation, growth and their interrelationships? Chapter Two tests the completeness of the pass-through of the central bank policy rate to bank lending rates on one hand, and the interest rate pass-through as a function of the level of financial development on the other hand. The results show that the pass-through of central bank policy rate to bank lending rates is asymmetric for three Anglophone West African countries, namely: Gambia, Ghana and Nigeria, which are seeking to ascend onto a single monetary framework. However, there is no evidence that financial development affects the pass-through of monetary policy. These findings still prove relevant, especially with regard to the quest for effective monetary policy implementation and the ascension onto a single monetary framework by these 3 countries. The motivation for this study stemmed from policy discussions and academic debates on the premise that financial development is a key element in the pursuit of effective monetary policy implementation, focusing on the three Anglophone West African countries between 1975 and 2011. The study employs the bounds testing approach to cointegration, and the Autoregressive Distributed Lags (ARDL) by Pesaran et al., (2001). The findings show significant differences in the interest rate pass-through of the 3 countries studied. Ghana and Gambia were characterised by undershooting in the response of lending rates to monetary policy changes whilst Nigeria was characterised by overshooting in bank lending rates. Financial development proved significant in some, but not in all the cases, while economic growth proved mostly insignificant in the transmission of the policy rate to bank lending rates In Chapter Three, we show that contractionary monetary policy of high interest rates is able to correct disequilibrium in the foreign currency market in selected countries in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). The chapter also provides empirical evidence about the impact of macroeconomic fundamentals on the domestic foreign exchange market. The study assesses the impact of monetary policy on foreign exchange market pressure (EMP) in developing country contexts focusing on some selected countries in SSA. EMP is the sum of exchange rate depreciation and change in foreign reserves that is required to restore equilibrium to the domestic foreign exchange market. The study was motivated by the fact that most of the SSA countries are developing economies that have negative net export positions and stand to lose significantly from consistently deteriorating foreign exchange positions. This study thus sought to measure the ability of monetary policy to significantly address currency pressures that arise from trading on the global market. The hypothesis that a tighter monetary policy stance can lend strength to a currency was tested in this study using Generalised Methods of Moments (GMM) estimation in a dynamic panel setting. Data on 20 SSA economies for which data were available for the period 1991 to 2010 are used. The study found a negative and significant relationship between monetary policy and EMP, implying that contractionary monetary policy can ease EMP.

TI  - The Monetary Policy of the European Central Bank (2002-2015)
AU  - Micossi, Stefano
AB  - This Special Report examines the policies pursued by the European Central Bank (ECB) since the inception of the euro. The ECB was originally set up to pursue price stability, with an eye also to economic growth and financial stability as subsidiary goals, once the primary goal was secured. The application of a single monetary policy to a diverse economic area has entailed a pronounced pro-cyclicality in its real economic effects on the eurozone periphery. Later, monetary policy became the main policy instrument to tackle financial instability elicited by the failure of Lehman Brothers and the sovereign debt crisis in the eurozone. In the process, the ECB emerged as the lender of last resort in the sovereign debt markets of participating countries. Persistent economic depression and deflation eventually brought the ECB into the uncharted waters of unconventional policies. That the ECB could legally perform all of these tasks bears witness to the flexibility of the TFEU and its Statute, but its tools and operating procedures were stretched to their limit. In the end, the place of the ECB amongst EU policy-making institutions has been greatly enhanced, but has entailed repeated intrusions into the broader domain of economic policies – not least because of its market intervention policies – whose consequences have yet to be ascertained.
