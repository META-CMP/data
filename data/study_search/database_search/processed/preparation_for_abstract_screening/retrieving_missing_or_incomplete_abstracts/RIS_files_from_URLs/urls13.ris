TI  - Asset Price and Monetary Policy: The Japanese Case
AU  - Kurihara, Yutaka
AB  - After the Bank of Japan (Japanese central bank) introduced unprecedented monetary policy in March 2011, it continuously conducted aggressive monetary policy to boost the economy. Moreover, it started to conduct stronger monetary policy in January 2013. It planned to double the monetary base to combat deflation and promote economic growth. The effectiveness of this large and unprecedented monetary base rule, which is not interest rate as used in traditional monetary policies targeted to boost the economy, has received much attention not only in Japan but also all over the world. This article empirically examines whether or not this monetary base rule would have achieved stock price rising in Japan. The results show no relationship between stock prices and monetary policy. The effect of monetary base expansion on Japanese stock prices was not found. Stock prices and exchange rates in the United States, on the other hand, have had significant effects on Japanese stock prices.

TI  - Aspects of Fiscal/Debt Management and Monetary Policy Interaction: The Recent Experience of Saudi Arabia
AU  - Al-Hamidy, Abdulrahman
AB  - As Saudi Arabia’s oil export revenues constitute about 90% of its budget, its fiscal policy is largely a function of developments in the oil market. Over the years, a countercyclical fiscal stance has been used to reduce the volatility of domestic growth against the background of vacillating oil revenues. Given the structure of the economy, the need is to continue to encourage the private sector to assume a greater role in the country’s diversification efforts. Reflecting the dominance of fiscal policy in Saudi Arabia and its impact on economic growth, the primary aim of monetary policy is to assure exchange rate stability with a view to providing an environment that is conducive to financial stability and sustainable growth. The interaction between monetary and fiscal policy has changed in the current global economic and financial climate. Greater cooperation between the fiscal and monetary authorities has become indispensable in meeting macroeconomic objectives. It is envisaged that policy interaction can return to normal modes of operation as the global economic recovery takes hold.

TI  - Analysis of the Effect of Investors’ Confidence on Monetary Policy Transmission Mechanism and Economic Growth without Crude Oil Export: A Multivariate GARCH Approach

T2  - Quarterly Journal of Quantitative Economics
AB  - The MGARCH approach is an important factor for the capital market and the investors. The main goal of investors is to get a maximum profit from the output of their investment. Financial assets must be greater than other options in order to encourage the investors to invest in them (Mehrani & Bahramfar, 2004). The implementation of efficient market economy theory by governors in the recent years has partially increased the capital market's share of money in financing firms. Qualitative and quantitative development of the capital market and Islamic financial affairs as the main sources of financing in the last two decades, formulation of accounting and auditing standards required for economic entities, and other corrective actions have turned the exchange market into one of the best options for investment. According to the latest statistics, more than ten million Iranians have stock code and have invested part of their resources in the exchange market. Considering the importance of the matter, this essay aims to study and survey the effect of financial sustainability on monetary policy transfer mechanisms. The correlation between investor confidence in the markets, money growth and macroeconomic growth without oil is going to be analyzed alongside their fluctuations. The practical research in the developed markets has shown that any change in macroeconomic variables brings about subsequent changes in stock prices; therefore, it is expected that there is a strong relationship between stock prices and macroeconomic variables. The stock price index is the most important factor influencing investor decision making in the stock market, and we need to be aware of the factors that influence stock price. The process of monetary policy transfer begins from the asset market because the costs of information and transaction for most assets are lower than the costs of changing the production or adjusting consumption or investment of durable goods, especially when there is uncertainty whether policies are permanent or temporary. The asset market responds very quickly, and thus assets prices play an important role in the money transfer mechanism. Using the MGARCH estimator, this study reveals the relationships between investors' confidence ratios, real money growth, and economic activity without crude oil exports and their fluctuations. Using this estimator helps estimation of uncertainties and produces perfectly consistent criteria. In this essay, the PEG index of price-earnings to earnings growth for a variable of investor confidence is used, which is a better indicator than PE. It should be put into consideration that the potential growth of the companies can reflect the life of the investors as it uses several revenue generating factors such as brand, human capital and expectations and barriers to entry. This study investigates the effect of financial sustainability on monetary policy transfer mechanisms in Iran. The correlation between investor confidence in markets, money growth and economic growth without Iranian crude exports is analyzed along with their volatility. We particularly consider the heterogeneity of error variances in an MGARCH framework to obtain the estimated uncertainty criteria endogenously. In this paper, seasonal data of variables from the beginning of 1991 to the end of 2016 are considered. The results have shown that there is a positive correlation between macroeconomic volatility without oil and PEG investor confidence. The M2 cash flow fluctuation has negative effects on PEG. The results also indicate a bilateral Grange impact between macroeconomic volatility without crude oil exports and liquidity volume. Other results of the study are: - Monetary policy can only directly affect investor confidence and its fluctuations in a long term. There is no significant Granger relationship between macroeconomic without oil and GDP growth. - The results show the negative impact of macroeconomic uncertainty on oil noilGDP growth and the cause of the negative effect between production growth and its medium- and long-term volatility. - If monetary policy can directly control the capital market and its sustainability, given the correlation with the noilGDP and its fluctuations, production consolidation and asset price seem to be sufficient goals. Of course, having a smooth economic cycle can relatively and satisfactorily stabilize the market. However, the analysis shows the importance of monetary policy, which reflects the strong negative correlation between currency fluctuations and macroeconomic stability without oil and assets.

T2  - Journal of International Money and Finance
AB  - We consider a model to detect the relation between household debt and the transmission of monetary policy in an EU Member State with independent monetary policy and high income inequality (Romania). We find that households response to changes in monetary conditions depends on their income and indebtedness profile. The transmission of monetary policy is more effective for middle income households, which are more indebted and have adjustable rates, as lower policy rates ease the consumption constraints on these households. Low income households respond mainly to budgetary policies, as the increase in disposable income matters most for the bottom quintile. Top income quintile reacts more to monetary policy than bottom quintile, but less than middle income quintiles. Lower inequality is associated with stronger effectiveness and higher homogeneity of monetary policy transmission; in turn, higher inequality is associated with less effectiveness and higher heterogeneity of the impact of the monetary policy.

AB  - One of the responses of the monetary policies of central banks to the sustainable development on financial markets, which also affected other markets and economic growth, is the role of non-standard monetary policies, referred to as quantitative easing in the form of Asset Purchase Programme. In this paper, the following main research problem was addressed: How can the Asset Purchase Programme help the European Central Bank fulfill its mandate of supervising the financial stability and financial development? Based on this, we formulated the main objective: to identify the impact of monetary policies on the dynamics of financial markets development, labor markets, and the markets for goods and services. As part of the applied methodology, the impact of the quantitative easing on the government bond yields curve was based on an indirect assessment using the seemingly unrelated regression model, considering the use of parameters from the functional benchmark form. Through the vector error correction model, another additional impact of the application of the monetary policy mechanisms on selected indicators of the considered markets was identified. The relationship between financial markets and economic growth was determined on the basis of the two-stage least square model using endogeneity control instruments. Applying the changes identified by the above models allowed us to determine the expected change in the rate of growth of the aggregate output of the euro area countries. Based on our results, we found out that Asset Purchase Programme had an impact on the growth of government bond yields issued by euro area countries, on lowering the risk rate on corporate bond markets, and increasing the nominal value of shares. In addition, growth in inflation and a decline in interest rates were affected. Finally, the European Central Bank (ECB)’s non-standard monetary policies have positively affected and stimulated the labor market and development in goods and services markets, referred to the sustainable financial development.

AU  - Chen, Yi-Kai

AB  - The goal of this essay is to examine estimates of individual bank X-efficiency
across time. First, we estimate a translog flexible function specification of bank
efficiency during the period 1988-1997. Then, we estimate a time-series/cross-sectional
model with independent variables that reflect business cycle and monetary policy
conditions that may affect bank performance. Like Calomiris and Mason (1997, 2000),
we find that leading business conditions are positively related to bank performance.
Though this result suggests that regulators should attempt to anticipate business cycle
downturns and influence bank portfolio risk accordingly, the business condition elasticity
of bank X-efficiency is low enough to suggest that the banking sector is not significantly
susceptible to a systemic event due to business cycle conditions alone. Lead and lag
relationship between large and small banks are also examined. Like Gilbert (1997), the
entrance of large banks into the local financial market does enhance small bank
efficiency simultaneously

T2  - Problems of Economic Transition
AB  - While price stability is the primary objective of the National Bank of Georgia, the monetary and exchange policy framework is complex, comprising three interrelated priorities: monetization, de-dollarization, and competitiveness. Shaped by the existing macroeconomic environment and structural and institutional arrangements this approach has emerged from the need to achieve and maintain long-term sustainable growth. It rests on the conventional doctrine that monetary policy cannot influence long-run trends of economic growth and employment. In a broad context it views the role of the monetary authorities in facilitating overall social and economic stability by maintaining low inflation and the purchasing power of the national currency. The effectiveness of the central bank has long been constrained by undeveloped financial markets and a lack of appropriate instruments. As of 2004, however, a whole array of new mechanisms was being introduced, which were expected to improve liquidity management practices and increase the flexibility and responsiveness of monetary policy to developments in the financial sphere.

AB  - This paper mainly concentrates on examining the impact of monetary policy on income inequality in Vietnam from 2001 to 2014. In our study, monetary policy shock is represented by the difference between the real and targeted growth rates of money supply of the State Bank of Vietnam (SBV), while income inequality is measured by Gini coefficients. The results of VAR model show that monetary policy has a small and lagged effect on income inequality. Besides monetary policy, inflation, education and unemployment are also found to have significant impact on income inequality, while economic growth has insignificant effect on this variable. Based on these findings, we suggest that the SBV should pay more attention at the inequality consequences caused by its monetary policy.

The benefits of de-dollarization in enhancing the effectiveness of monetary policy are exaggerated. In the early stages of transitional development, dollarization has promoted exchange rate and price stability, and financial re-intermediationFinancial re-intermediationin the CLMV countries. Trade expansion, financial deepening, and consequent economic growth can be attributed to an environment of exchange rate and price stability provided by dollar anchoring. When macroeconomic stability, banking culture, and regulations are firmly established, a gradual de-dollarization process can take place, thereby improving the effectiveness of monetary policy in the long run.

The study covers the secondary data of 10 developed and 30 underdeveloped countries throughout 2004–2018. It is concluded that monetary policy effectiveness and financial inclusion do not have a contemporaneous impact on each other. Nevertheless, the reduced-form Vector Auto-regressive witness the reverse causality between financial inclusion and monetary policy effectiveness in developed countries. Thus, effective monetary policy enhances financial inclusion in a country, and a higher degree of financial inclusion lowers the inflation rate and makes monetary policy effective. One way causality from monetary policy effectiveness to financial inclusion can be observed in under-developed countries. Using the Structural Vector auto-regressive technique and financial inclusion index composed of three-dimension to examine the relationship of monetary policy effectiveness and financial inclusion in developed and developing countries is considered the study’s significant contribution.

AU  - Keshavarz, Hadi

T2  - Economic Strategy
AB  - One of the most important institutional factors determining the effectiveness of monetary policy is trust in the monetary authority. Trust in the monetary authority from the perspective of economic policy in the short run will lower inflation expectations and in the long run will lead to long-term structural reforms that will increase economic growth and reduce inflation. In this regard, this study attempts to model the effect of trust in monetary authority on macroeconomic variables by modeling a dynamic stochastic general equilibrium model. The results of the model show that improvement in trust to monetary authority by affecting the expectations of economic agents and lowering the (price) expectations increases investment and employment and provides economic growth. Also, by Scenario in the model and considering different levels of trust, it was found that improving the level of trust enhances the impact of shocks on economic variables. In other words, increasing in trust to the monetary authority reduces the response of economic agents to the risk and thus makes money more attractive to the productive sector, thereby enhancing the effect of shocks such as monetary shocks on economic growth. Therefore, policymakers' efforts to rebuild and raise trust in monetary authority can help improve economic conditions.

T2  - JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL STUDIES
AB  - The study focuses on revealing key monetary policy instruments that can influence stock market development and elaborating whether shocks from financial markets and other macroeconomic conditions are further transferred to the real sector, as expected under the monetary transmission mechanism. This paper is an extension of our previous theoretical and empirical research expanding to ten developed and eight developing economies for the period of 1999-2020 using panel data and vector autoregressive models, impulse response functions, and scenario analysis. Firstly, it was examined that actions of monetary policymakers were efficient for stimulating the development of stock markets mostly for developed countries, whereas stock indices in most developing countries seemed not to be sensitive to changes in monetary conditions. Using scenario analysis and impulse response functions, it was discovered that in developing countries, including Poland and Ukraine, an expansionary policy focused on increasing money supply would mitigate deceleration and facilitate the growth of stock indices in the next four quarters, whereas, in developed countries, including the USA, a decline in interest rates under expansionary regime would stimulate the development of stock markets. Finally, the evolution of financial markets together with macroeconomic, social, and political conditions was concluded to be a statistically important factor of economic growth, as initially expected.

This is done in order to either “achieve some combination of inflation and output stabilization” (Mathai, 2009) or, more generally, to target either a certain level of a specific (nominal) interest rate - the refinancing rate - or the monetary base (Bofinger et al., 2001, pp. 63). The latter defined objective of monetary policy is more general as it lets open the question whether and if so, how monetary policy affects the real sphere measured by macroeconomic variable such as Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and the unemployment rate.

AB  - Chen, Y. and Cheng, Q., 2020. Investment heterogeneity among sectors and asymmetric effects of monetary policies: A case study of China's marine economic development demonstration zone. In: Liu, X. and Zhao, L. (eds.), Today's Modern Coastal Society: Technical and Sociological Aspects of Coastal Research. Journal of Coastal Research, Special Issue No. 111, pp. 198–203. Coconut Creek (Florida), ISSN 0749-0208.As China's economy enters the “New Normal” monetary policy, an important tool for macroeconomic regulation plays an increasingly important role in balancing supply and demand and ensuring sound and sustained economic growth. The present study divides the monetary policy transmission channels into two categories, namely, the currency channel and the credit channel. Based on the monthly statistics on China's overall economic growth and on the nation's marine economic development demonstration zones from January 2005 to December 2018, empirical approaches of VAR modeling and variance decomposition were applied to evaluate how monetary policies affect the investment decisions of state-owned enterprises and private enterprises in China's marine economic development demonstration zones. The research revealed obvious asymmetry in the monetary policy transmission mechanism. Further research found that the currency transmission channel has a larger impact on the investment decision-making of private enterprises than the credit channel, whereas they have practically an equal impact on the investment decision-making of state-owned enterprises. Targeted measures should be taken to support key areas and weak links in China's marine economic development, and collaborative efforts from multiple parties are needed to optimize the monetary policy transmission mechanism.

AB  - The study investigated the nexus on the responsiveness of Nigeria economy to monetary policy from 1986-2018. The study employed the Ordinary Least Square method for the estimation. The study tested for descriptive statistics, tested for unit root where real gross domestic product and exchange rate are integrated of I(2), money supply, monetary policy, inflation, liquidity ratio and external reserve are integrated of order I(1) and interest rate is integrated of order I(0). The study also used the Johansen co-integration test to confirm the long run relationship among the variables. The result of the study reveals that monetary policy has a positive impact on economic growth In Nigeria. The study concluded and recommended that there is need to reduce the excessive government expenditure in line with the objectives of monetary policy of the government. Again, monetary policy measures should be well co-ordinated so that the desired behavioural changes in the real sector will be achieved

T2  - Macroeconomic Dynamics
AB  - This study explores the growth and welfare effects of monetary policy in a scale-invariant Schumpeterian growth model with endogenous human capital accumulation. We model money demand via a cash-in-advance (CIA) constraint on research and development (R&D) investment. Our results can be summarized as follows. We find that an increase in the nominal interest rate leads to a decrease in R&D and human capital investment, which, in turn, reduces the long-run growth rates of technology and output. This result stands in stark contrast to the case of exogenous human capital accumulation in which the long-run growth rates of technology and output are independent of the nominal interest rate. Simulating the transitional dynamics, we find that the additional long-run growth effect under endogenous human capital accumulation amplifies the welfare effect of monetary policy. Decreasing the nominal interest rate from 10% to 0% leads to a welfare gain that is equivalent to a permanent increase in consumption of 2.82% (2.38%) under endogenous (exogenous) human capital accumulation.

T2  - Cogent Business & Management
AB  - The impact of monetary policy on bank performance and risk is driven by bank individual characteristics and the COVID-19 pandemic, and the joint effect of bank individual factors and the coronavirus has been under-researched so far. To fill this void, this research applies the dynamic two-step system generalized method of moments (S-GMM) estimator to a sample of representative commercial banks on a quarterly basis for a small open emerging market such as Vietnam. We find that monetary policy expansion stimulates both banks’ performance and risk in a COVID-19 pandemic. Interestingly, the effectiveness of monetary policy expansion on banks’ operating outcomes is dependent on the interaction between the heterogeneity of the bank’s balance sheet items and the COVID-19 outbreak. More specifically, the performance-decreasing effects of monetary policy loosening are more pronounced in banks with small size, high liquidity, low capitalization, and high credit risk in the shadow of the COVID-19 crisis. Meanwhile, the risk-increasing impacts of monetary policy easing are conspicuous in well liquid, less capitalized, and high credit risk banks in an uncertain time of the COVID-19 crisis. These results are robust to alternative proxies of monetary policy instruments.

AB  - This paper examines firms’ access to bank and market finance when allowance is made for differences in firm-specific characteristics. A theoretical model determines the characteristics such as size, risk and debt that would determine firms’ access to bank or market finance; these characteristics can result in greater (or lesser) tightening of credit when interest rates increase. An empirical evaluation of the predictions of the model is conducted on a large panel of UK manufacturing firms. We confirm that small, young and risky firms are more significantly affected by tight monetary conditions than large, old and secure firms.

AB  - This paper investigates the effectiveness of monetary policy instruments under dollarization in association with economic growth and inflation using 30 countries from 2000 to 2016. The estimation results indicate that first, the monetary aggregates, M2, are more relevant policy instruments while the interest rates including policy rates exhibit overall limited effectiveness under dollarization. Second, the effectiveness of monetary aggregates in association with economic growth is more significant and sizable in the countries with floating exchange rates. Finally, the relevancy of interest rate rules for monetary policies is relatively improved for the de-dollarization countries.

TI  - Monetary Policy, Private Capital Formation and Economic Growth – The Case of Sub-Saharan Africa
AU  - John Gachunga, Muhia
AU  - Kuso, Yasin
AB  - The study sought to test the impact of the policy rate on growth and investment in some selected countries in the Sub-Saharan Africa region. Data for nine (9) countries over a 23-year period was captured and a dynamic panel model estimated. Based on the study results, the major findings were: growth in SSA is cyclical whilst private capital formation is a persistent and smooth function in the region. Growth is positively related to the policy rate, following the McKinnon and Shaw (1973) hypothesis, but stock market development has no effect on growth or private capital formation. The overall impact of trade openness is ambiguous and the policy rate is not a critical factor to private capital formation in the SSA region. Based on the purpose of the study it can be concluded, that while private capital is obviously positively influential on growth, the formation of private capital to stimulate growth is not driven by the monetary policy stance.

AB  - This article examines the determinants economic growth under the perspective of monetary policy in the case of Pakistan over the period of 1980 to 2018. Economic growth has been used as dependent variable, whereas exchange rate, consumer price index, unemployment rate and money supply have been used as independent variables. For empirical analysis data from 1980 to 2018 has been used. For checking the stationarity of the variables augmented Dickey-Fuller unit root test has been used. This study has used ARDL test for examining the cointegration among the variable of the model. The estimated results of the study show that the exchange rate has a positive and significant impact on economic growth in the case of Pakistan. Inflation has a positive, but insignificant impact on economic growth in the case of Pakistan over the selected time period. Unemployment rate negative and significant impact on economic growth in the case of Pakistan. The estimates show that monetary policy has a positive and significant impact on economic growth in the case of Pakistan. This study suggests that for raising the level of economic growth in the case of Pakistan, a soft monetary policy is needed to lower level of unemployment.

And it shows that, far from being either necessary or good for economic growth, excessive inequality tends to lead to weaker economic performance. In light of this, it argues for a range of policies that would increase both equity and economic well-being.

TI  - Inflation and Economic Growth
AU  - Barro, Robert J.
AB  - Data for around 100 countries from 1960 to 1990 are used to assess the effects of inflation on economic performance. If a number of country characteristics are held constant, then regression results indicate that the impact effects from an increase in average inflation by 10 percentage points per year are a reduction of the growth rate of real per capita GDP by 0.2-0.3 percentage points per year and a decrease in the ratio of investment to GDP by 0.4-0.6 percentage points. Since the statistical procedures use plausible instruments for inflation, there is some reason to believe that these relations reflect causal influences from inflation to growth and investment. However, statistically significant results emerge only when high- inflation experiences are included in the sample. Although the adverse influence of inflation on growth looks small, the long-term effects on standards of living are substantial. For example, a shift in monetary policy that raises the long-term average inflation rate by 10 percentage points per year is estimated to lower the level of real GDP after 30 years by 4-7%, more than enough to justify a strong interest in price stability.

AB  - Mainstream monetary theory rests on two arguments: inflation is determined by demand, and interest rates are used to return inflation to its target: central banks are the guardians of inflation. However, for post-Keynesians, inflation cannot be caused by demand, and there exists a poor and unreliable relationship between interest rates and aggregate demand. The whole theoretical edifice of the neoclassical approach collapses. Therefore, if monetary policy is based on a wrong interpretation of inflation and the link between aggregate demand and interest rates, the result can be and has been catastrophic. It leads to periods of crisis in aggregate demand.

AB  - Economic growth has become the primary goal for the advancement of societies, with tangible improvements in the fundamentals of life, and has been intended for all governments to be a critical destination for raising low living standards. Economic growth needed to infuse the spirit of diversity into the trade interaction movement. By diversifying markets and the economy, the need for financial inclusion has emerged through the mainstreaming of financial and banking services at a reasonable cost to the largest number of the public. In particular, low income segments, the employment of the banking business has stimulated activities, services and tasks to include bank accounts and introducing the ATM into the service, finding points of sale, as well as loans and settling the salaries of State employees, Remittances at the local and external levels have a significant impact on the modernization of the cultural, behavioral and social system of members of this Iraqi society. On the other hand, economic stability is one of the objectives of monetary policy, as it is the way to achieve economic growth in the country. The emergence of a new phenomenon, such as fiscal inclusion, affects monetary policy and enhances its effectiveness within the country, as fiscal inclusion increases the degree to which members of society respond to changes in monetary instruments. Fiscal inclusion would affect the totality of economic variables, including monetary policy rates. The two researchers found that there was a correlation between fiscal inclusion and the monetary policy of monetary policy rates.

AB  - This study investigates the effect of exchange rate movements on real output growth in Nigeria. Based on quarterly series for the period 1986 to 2010, the paper examines the possible direct and indirect relationship between exchange rates and GDP growth. The relationship is derived in two ways using a simultaneous equations model within a fully specified (but small) macroeconomic model. A Generalised Method of Moments (GMM) technique was explored. The estimation results suggest that there is no evidence of a strong direct relationship between changes in exchange rate and output growth. Rather, Nigeria's economic growth has been directly affected by monetary variables. These factors have tended to sustain a pattern of real exchange rate, which has been unfavourable for growth. The conclusion is that improvements in exchange rate management are necessary but not adequate to revive the Nigerian economy. A broad program of economic reform is required to complement the exchange rate policy adopted.

AB  - This study investigates the mixed impact of fiscal-monetary policies on economic
growth in Vietnam, an emerging economy in the Asia-Pacific region. The Vector autoregressive method (VAR), a quantitative technique, is employed on a quarterly database collected in 2004–2018.
The cointegration test indicates a long-term cointegration relationship between these macroeconomic
policies and the growth of gross output. The variance decomposition and impulse response function
conclude that the impacts of these policies on economic growth are quite weak and faint. However,
our results indicate that monetary policy is more significant than fiscal policy in supporting economic
growth. The results imply that these economic policies may give priority to other macroeconomic
objectives instead of promoting economic growth in the studied period. Hence, policymakers need to
have more solutions to improve the efficiency of these policies in Vietnam in the future.

TI  - The Impact of Monetary Policy on Housing Prices in China
AU  - Chen, Shen
AU  - Wei, Wan
AU  - Huang, Peng
AB  - This paper examines the impact of monetary policy on housing prices in China with a VAR model. Granger causality tests, impulse response functions, and variance decompositions are used to analyze the impacts of two monetary policy variables, market-based short-term interest rates and money supply, on housing prices. The results show that a contractionary monetary policy will cause the growth rate of housing prices to decline in China. In particular, a positive shock to market-based interest rates measured by the 7-day interbank offered rate has a significant and negative effect on housing prices in a range from five months to one and a half years after the shock takes place. However, our paper finds no evidence that supports the significant impact from money supply on housing prices. The results of our paper imply that the market-based short-term interest rates are effective monetary policy instruments for the central bank in China to conduct its policy to affect housing prices.

AB  - In this paper, we examine the impact of competition in the banking industry on financial market activity. In particular, we explore this issue in a setting where banks simultaneously insure individuals against liquidity risk and offer loans to promote intertemporal consumption smoothing. In addition, spatial separation and private information generate a transactions role for money. Interestingly, we demonstrate that the industrial organization of the financial system bears significant implications for the effects of monetary policy. Under perfect competition, higher rates of money growth lead to lower interest rates and a higher volume of lending activity. In contrast, in a monopoly banking sector, money growth restricts the availability of funds and raises the cost of borrowing.

AB  - The real exchange rate was not at the center of the first generation of neoclassical growth models, nor was it prominent among the policy prescriptions that flowed from those models. Recent analyses, in contrast, have paid it more attention. This article, based on the author's W. Arthur Lewis Lecture to the Institute of Economic and Social Studies,1 discusses different approaches to conceptualizing the role of the real exchange rate in the growth process. La tasa de cambio real no fue el centro de la primera generación de los modelos de crecimiento neoclásicos, ni tampoco fue prominente entre las prescripciones de políticas que surgieron de esos modelos.

Arthur Lewis dictada en el Instituto de Economía y Estudios Sociales, discute diferentes enfoques para conceptuar el papel de la tasa de cambio real en el proceso de crecimiento. Le taux de change réel ne faisait pas partie intégrante de la première génération de modèles néoclassiques de croissance – il ne figurait pas non plus parmi les ordonnances politiques émanant de ces modèles. Des analyses récentes, par contre, leur ont prêté plus d'attention. Le présent article, fondé sur la conférence prononcée par W.

TI  - EFFECTS OF SOUTH AFRICAN MONETARY POLICY IMPLEMENTATION ON THE CMA: A PANEL VECTOR AUTOREGRESSION APPROACH
AU  - Seleteng, Monaheng
AB  - The paper investigates the effects of South African monetary policy implementation on selected macroeconomic variables in the rest of the Common Monetary Area (CMA) looking specifically at the response of a shock to South African key interest rate (repo rate) on macroeconomic variables such as the regional lending rates, interest rate spread, private sector credit, money supply, inflation and economic growth in the rest of the CMA countries. The analysis is conducted using impulse-response functions derived from Panel Vector Autoregression (PVAR) methodology. The estimates are conducted using annual data for a panel of four CMA countries for the period 1980 – 2012. The results show that a positive shock to South African repo rate significantly affects lending rates, inflation and economic growth in the entire CMA countries. South African repo rate has more impact on lending rates in the entire CMA. This is then followed by the impact on inflation and then economic growth.

AB  - A healthy fiscal and monetary policies form the basis for economic growth and sustainability of an economy. This work seeks to look at the effect of monetary and fiscal policies on economic growth in Nigeria, to examine how government tax alter the effect of monetary policy, To see how interaction of government recurrent expenditure with monetary policy does alter the effect of monetary policy rate, money supply and inflation on economic growth in Nigeria, and to see if the interaction of government capital expenditure with monetary policy affects monetary policy rate, money supply and inflation on economic growth in Nigeria. This study uses time series data from 1995 to 2021 which were sourced from the Central Bank of Nigeria Statistical Bulletin. The variables used in this study include; Money Supply (MS), Inflation (INF), Monetary Policy Rate (MPR), Government Tax Revenue (GTAX), Total Government Capital Expenditure (TGCE) and Total Government Recurrent Expenditure (TGRE). The data were examined using Ordinary Least Square Regression method and the robustness of the model was tested using post-estimation techniques such as Durbin-Watson test for autocorrelation, Jarque-Bera test for normality, Breusch-Godfrey Serial Correlation test and the Ramsey RESET test for specification correctness. Findings indicate that contractionary policies have caused reduced economic growth and the increase in monetary base in the economy has contributed significantly to economic growth. The study recommends Contractionary monetary policies should be matched with increase in taxation while expansionary monetary policies should be combined with a downward review of tax rates in the country.

Specifically, it investigates the impact of monetary policy rate, money supply, liquidity ratio, and change in maximum lending rate on bank credit in Nigeria. Design/methodology – A monthly time series data from 2007-2019 were sourced from the Central Bank’s of Nigeria statistical bulletin. The sourced data was subjected to multiple regression analysis using the fully modified ordinary least square regression to estimate the parameters of the model. Results – Findings reveal that money supply significantly and positively influence bank credit in Nigeria; while liquidity ratio significantly but negatively influence bank credit in Nigeria. On the contrary, monetary policy rate and maximum lending rate were found not to significantly affect bank credit in the case of Nigeria.Policy Recommendation - Study therefore, recommend that monetary authorities especially, the Central Bank of Nigeria should pay more attention to lowering the liquidity ratio while increasing money supply in order to engender banks credit creation ability and further stimulate the Nigerian economy for growth.

However, growth rate has slow down since the third quarter of 2014. Through this paper, we aim at investigating the impacts of monetary policy on industrial sector growth, and determine whether the long-run industrial sector growth in China can be foster by the effectiveness of monetary policy. It also examines the interrelationships among the variables employed and determines the steady-state relationships between industrial sector growth and monetary policy. Time-series econometric techniques such as unit roots, ARDL and ECM are employed to monthly data for the year 1994:1 to 2013:12.According to the empirical results derived, the effectiveness of monetary policy significantly affects industrial sector growth and the short-run impact of monetary policy on industrial output production is established.

AB  - Studying the impact of monetary factors on Nigeria’s economic growth has become imperative in the face of the challenges of excess liquidity, poor access to credit, high cost of capital, inflation, and decreasing rate of economic growth. Hence this paper applied econometric modeling in the development of a prediction model for economic growth using critical indices of monetary policy. The results show that there is a significant relationship between money supply, foreign exchange rate and economic growth in Nigeria. However, the possibility of convergence of short-run dynamics of monetary policy factors to long-run equilibrium in economic growth was established. Though, the speed of adjustment with respect to foreign exchange rate was observed to be slow.

TI  - THE INFLUENCE OF INTEREST RATE DEREGULATION AND MONETARY POLICY EFFECTIVENESS ON ECONOMIC GROWTH IN NIGERIA
AU  - Ohiomu, Sylvester
T2  - Journal of Academic Research in Economics (JARE)
AB  - This study examined the influence of deregulation of interest rate and monetary policy effectiveness on Nigerian economy. The study covered the period 1970-2018 which encompasses a period of major reforms in monetary policy. The Autoregressive Distributed Lags (ARDL) approach to co-integration, structural break test and error correction mechanism (ECM) test were applied in the study. The results revealed positive impact of deregulation on economic growth in Nigeria. It also revealed that deregulation policy has been a hindrance to the efficacy of monetary policy. The study therefore recommends a guided and a well-planned deregulation policy embedded with increase in the level of money supply coupled with more attention on the productive sector of the country. Banks should be directed to make adequate credits available to investors to lubricate the economy for greater output. The Securities and Exchange Commission should re-engineer and reinvigorate optimal development of both money and capital markets to achieve the desired results.

AB  - Monetary and fiscal policies focused on macroeconomic stabilization, on the one hand, demonstrate formal success, as evidenced by the dynamics of inflation, budget deficit, and public debt. On the other hand, this does not lead to an increase in business activity and economic growth, nor does it enhance the well-being of the population. This article attempts to analyze the reasons for the standard instruments of macroeconomic stabilization used in Russia being unable to intensify the financing of economic growth: for a high level of risks in the economy, distortions in credit selection, and a lack of selective measures in monetary policy. This is an incomplete list but even it is sufficient for drawing conclusions about the need to create a whole range of new institutions and instruments and adjust the old ones, without which Russian macroeconomic policy is unable to cope with the task of ensuring economic growth.

AB  - The nexus between trade conflict and monetary policy is of great importance in international political and economic analysis. By employing data from a panel of global countries covering the period 2000–2015, this paper empirically analyzes the impact of trade conflict on monetary policy and how it works. We document the evidence that trade conflict has caused targeted countries to implement loose monetary policy. We also find that the impact of trade conflict is not only effective in the current year, but also continues in the next five years. In addition, we show that the significant impact on monetary policy is manifested in non-OECD countries and transition countries but not in OECD countries and non-transition countries. Consequently, we believe our findings should shed light on those policy makers in target countries, who can hopefully prepare for potential trade conflict and avoid similar disputes from interfering with the effectiveness of monetary policies in the domestic economy by providing practical currency and valuation strategies.

This paper analyses the importance of monetary policy for economic growth and for macroeconomic (in)stability using a newly built database with original information collected by the authors. It provides an empirical illustration of the relationship between the declared objectives and targets of monetary policy in different countries and their economic performance (measured by GDP growth rate, GDP per capita and other indicators) through discriminant analysis framework.

T2  - IMF Staff Papers
AB  - This paper develops a new public domestic debt database covering 93 low-income countries and emerging markets over 1975–2004 to estimate the growth impact of domestic debt. Moderate levels of noninflationary domestic debt, as a share of GDP and bank deposits, are found to exert a positive overall impact on economic growth. Granger-causality regressions suggest support for a variety of channels: improved monetary policy; broader financial market development; strengthened domestic institutions/accountability; and enhanced private savings and financial intermediation. There is some evidence that, above a ratio of 35 percent of bank deposits, domestic debt begins to undermine growth, lending credence to traditional crowding out and bank efficiency concerns. Importantly, the growth contribution of domestic debt is higher if it is marketable, bears positive real interest rates, and is held outside the banking system.

AB  - This paper investigates the financial stability’s effect on the monetary policy transmission mechanisms. The correlations between investors’ confidence in the markets, money growth and economic growth are analyzed along with the correlations within their volatilities. Specifically, the heteroskedasticity of the errors is exploited in a Multivariate GARCH framework to obtain endogenously estimated measures of uncertainty. By a two-step estimator, the indirect interplay of money growth and financial markets is highlighted at different time horizons. The results contrast previous literature supportive of the “Great Moderation” as causing the recent financial crisis. Effectively, by accounting for the breaks in volatility series due to structural shifts in monetary policy, a low period of macroeconomic volatility is found not to drive directly low financial stability.

To do this we modify two models of economic growth by considering the role of entrepreneurs, risk takers, and a monetary authority which is the average agent of the economy that is assumed to be aware of how the inflation can damage equally the individuals' life style, independently of their particular levels of income, finding that the impact of the monetary instruments depends on the behavior of the population.

TI  - Macroeconomic Effects of Monetary and Fiscal Policy Interactions on Economic Growth Dynamics in Nigeria
AU  - Salis (E-SKY), Kolawole
AU  - Saibu, Olufemi
AB  - Over the years, the Nigerian economy has been faced with continuous disequilibrium and complexity in policy direction that constitutes a major setback in the growth pattern and macroeconomic instability. In this regard, the paper investigated the effectiveness of fiscal-monetary policy interactions on real output growth in Nigeria between 1999 and 2016. The dynamic analyses of variables have been captured by the multiple least square estimators. The estimated findings reveal that both fiscal and monetary policies variables are effective in stimulating economic growth in the country. However, it was found that fiscal-monetary policy interactions have significant but negative impact on real GDP in Nigeria for the period considered. Thus, it seemed that in past there was no evidence of synergy between fiscal and monetary policies interactions in achieving economic growth in Nigeria. It is therefore recommended that, in order to put Nigerian economy on the path of sustainable growth, the government must co-ordinate fiscal and monetary policies and adopt a policy-mix that will promote growth and greater welfare of the citizenry.

AB  - In the financial system and economy, the banking industry plays a crucial role. Default risk takes central stage in preserving financial stability and needs to be mitigated as it can trigger a crisis. The study examines the combined effects of monetary policy and bank competition on banking defaults. Using a sample of 95 commercial banks in Indonesia between 2009 and 2019, this study employs the Generalized Method of Moments, a two-step dynamic panel-data estimation system, to analyze it. Empirical estimation results show that monetary policy, through an increase in the benchmark interest rate, negatively affects probability of default. The extent of banking stability is also enhanced by monetary policy. Banking competition has a negative and significant effect on probability of default and has a positive effect on the banking distance to default. Furthermore, the combined impact of monetary policy and banking competition positively affects probability of default but has a negative impact on the distance of default. Building on this study, to promote a stable and more efficient banking system, policymakers should develop policies that foster complementary monetary and competition policies.

TI  - Inflation Targeting Monetary Policy, Inflation Volatility and Economic Growth in South Africa
AU  - Kumo, Wolassa L
AB  - This paper investigates the impact of inflation targeting monetary policy and inflation volatility on economic growth in South Africa. Inflation volatility is measured by conditional variance generated by fitting an empirical Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Hetroskedasticity (GARCH) model to a seasonally adjusted annualized quarterly consumer price inflation for the period 1960Q1-2013Q3. The volatility measure, together with macroeconomic control variables, was used to estimate economic growth models for two periods corresponding to two monetary policy regimes and a third period covering the full sample. The first period corresponds to the pre-inflation targeting regime covering 1960Q1-1998Q4. During this period, the country had adopted various monetary policy frameworks including exchange-rate targeting, discretionary monetary policy, monetary-aggregate targeting and an eclectic approach. This period was largely characterized by high and more volatile inflation. The inflation volatility in turn had statistically significant negative impact on economic growth during this period. Nonetheless, inflation volatility did not have statistically significant impact on real economic growth during the inflation targeting monetary policy period, i.e. 2000Q1-2013Q3. The empirical results for the combined growth model are consistent with the findings for the two periods. The implication of this is that by adopting the inflation targeting monetary policy framework since 2000, South Africa has succeeded in achieving low and stable general price level thereby creating a conducive environment for economic growth. The higher growth period of the mid 2000s followed the introduction of inflation targeting monetary policy regime. Nevertheless, higher Sacrifice Ratio of disinflation and entrenched structural bottlenecks continue to undermine growth and stifle the spillover effects from low and stable inflation to real economic activities. The government may consider to urgently implement structural reforms to unlock the economic growth potential while ensuring more flexibility in the disinflation policy regime.

AB  - This paper examines the impact of monetary policy instruments such as discount rate, reserve requirement and liquidity requirement on bank credit to the private sector in the Kingdom of Eswatini. Monthly data sourced from the Central Bank of Eswatini and Eswatini Central Statistics Office is used for the period January 2000 to December 2017. Using the Johansen cointegration test and Vector Error Correction Model, our results show that: there is one cointegration in the model and the current levels of the discount rate, reserve requirement and liquidity requirement bear a negative and significant effect to bank credit to the private sector. This indicates that the three instruments are not supportive to economic growth and they are not optimal to stimulate credit. Applying the Quadratic approach, findings of this study reveal that the optimal monetary policy mix (thresholds) to stimulate bank credit to the private sector while maintaining inflation within reasonable levels is 5.42% for the discount rate, 4.03% for the reserve requirement, 12.48% for the liquidity requirement. The study recommends that the Central Bank of Eswatini should always take into account the existence of trade-off in monetary policy instruments results in order to stimulate bank lending to the private sector.

TI  - Monetary policy dynamics and economic growth in Sub-Saharan Africa : an empirical investigation
AU  - Olamide, Ebenezer G.
AB  - The broad idea behind this dissertation is to undertake an empirical investigation into the nexus between monetary policy dynamics vis-a-vis growth in Sub-Saharan African countries. Basically, the study empirically seeks to provide answers to four major questions, namely: (i)  monetary policy dynamics on growth in SSACs? (iii) What are the dynamic interactions between monetary policy variables and growth and (iv) To what extent do the identified external factors of oil and commodity price volatilities influence monetary policy dynamics in
SSACs? Due to data collection constraints, 36 countries within the four major economic blocs of EAC, CEMAC, ECOWAS and SADC were selected covering a period from 1980-2015 thereby making the residuals both time series and cross sectional in nature. The overall variables of interest as identified in the literature are gross domestic product growth rate, money supply growth rate, exchange rate, inflation rate, interest rate, government expenditures, net domestic credit, oil and commodity price volatilities, and a dummy variable for the global financial crisis. The starting point in the estimation of the models is the use of Exponential
Generalized Auto-regressive Conditional Heteroskedaticity (EGARCH) to examine the asymmetric effects of oil and commodity price volatilities on the economic growth of SSA. Relevant econometric tests such as tests for the stationarity of variables (unit root tests), long run relationship test (test for cointegration), Wald tests and Lag selection criteria were performed in order to avoid the problems of spurious regression and unreliable results. Basically, the study used panel data regressions and the panel results revealed the presence of
cross sectional dependence which necessitated the breaking down of the analyses into individual economic blocs of CEMAC, EAC, ECOW AS and SADC. In order to capture the first objective of the study, the Panel-ARDL approach of cointegration analysis, which most satisfies the outcomes of the unit root tests was employed. The fixed and random effects models supported by dynamic panel model formed the basis of the analysis for objective two. An eightvariable Structural-VAR was employed to generate Impulse Response Functions and Variance Decompositions for the analysis of objectives three and four of the study. Under the first objective, the GDP, which represents output, was confirmed as an important determinant of monetary policy dynamics across the four economic blocs, even though, this was more grounded in SADC and CEMAC where financial deepening is very effective. The second variable investigated, which is money supply growth rate (financial deepening), is found to have a significant impact on monetary policy dynamics in SSA but the effect is more pronounced in SADC, EAC and CEMAC. The findings further underscore the effect of financial deepening or effective money supply in monetary policy effectiveness in SSA. The next variable, which is exchange rate, was confirmed from the results as an important factor that affects monetary policy dynamics across the four economic blocs in SSA. Although it plays different roles across the economic blocs, the impact has generally been shown to be
significant on monetary policy dynamics in SSA. Unlike other variables however, inflation did not display an overwhelming influence as an important variable affecting monetary policy dynamics in SSA as a whole. In spite of this, its effect was found significant in the two largest economic blocs of ECOW AS and SADC. However, government expenditure, net domestic credit and gross capital formation fail to exhibit a noticeable impact as determinants on monetary policy dynamics across all four economic unions in SSA. The result of the impact of
monetary policy variables on the economic growth of SSA shows that the dynamics in monetary policy during the period under review have a significant impact on the economic growth of SSA but this varies from one economic bloc to another. For instance, exchange rate shows a more diverse result as it reveals that its impact is more pronounced in ECOW AS than the other three blocs. The influence of other macroeconomic variables such as inflation rate accounted for significant changes in the economic outlook of SSA with their attendant effects on the relationship between monetary policy and economic growth as well. The results of the dynamic interactions between monetary policy variables and economic growth of SSA show that monetary policy dynamics is greatly influenced by the external shocks from both oil and commodity price volatilities and the transmission mechanism channels indicate that this is passed through the monetary policy rate to exchange rate, and from exchange rate to GDP growth rate in CEMAC. As for the other economic blocs, the medium of transmission is through exchange rate to monetary policy rate and finally to GDP growth rate. Consequently,
the medium of transmission of external shocks to the domestic economies in SSA is exchange rate for ECOW AS, SADC and EAC but in CEMAC, monetary policy rate is the medium of transmission. In summary, expansion of the economic base of the region, increase in domestic output, policy harmonization, import restrictions and improved infrastructural facilities coupled with increased agricultural productivities are some of the proffered policy recommendations for the SSACs.

TI  - The imperatives of e-banking for monetary policy in Nigeria.
AU  - Bamidele, A.
T2  - CBN Economic and Financial Review (EFR)
AB  - The electronic delivery of banking services is fast gaining wide acceptance in many jurisdictions including Nigeria. The importance of this channel of banking service delivery has been strengthened by advancement in information and communications technology (ICT) that has reshaped global financial architecture. This paper examines the crucial nature of electronic banking (e-banking) to monetary policy implementation in Nigeria and advocated necessary actions for enhancing the effectiveness and efficiency of monetary policy execution for the achievement of the ultimate target of economic growth and development. It is postulated that, subject to initial conditions and establishment of risk mitigating factors, e-banking is beneficial to monetary policy execution, financial sector and economic development in Nigeria as speed and convenience endears banking culture to greater segment of the economy while the proportion of money stock under the discretionary control of the monetary authorities is increased. Although, some seigniorage income may be lost, the Central Bank of Nigeria's contribution to the economy should be measured in terms of achievement of its mandate of price stability and efficient payments system in a stable financial environment that engenders balanced and sustainable economic growth and development.

TI  - The monetary policy change in Turkey in 2009 and its implications for inflation and growth
AU  - Karaman, Kıvanç
AU  - Yıldırım-Karaman, Seçil
AB  - In 2009, the Central Bank of the Republic of Turkey switched from a strict rule-based inflation targeting policy to a discretionary policy aiming for financial stability and growth. This paper investigates the consequences of this policy shift for monetary transmission, inflation rate and economic growth using the Synthetic Control Method. More specifically, the paper presents a counterfactual estimation of the inflation rate and the economic growth in Turkey after 2009. The estimation results suggest that the growth rate would have been similar afterwards, but the inflation rate would have been on average three percentage points lower had the CBRT stuck to the inflation targeting policy. This finding lends support to the argument that for developing countries inflation targeting works as a transparency and credibility tool and improves economic outcomes.

AB  - The objective of the study is to examine the relationship between monetary policy, domestic prices, financial development and economic growth in a context of Pakistan by using a consistent time series data from 1980 to 2016. The results show that real interest rate increases exchange rate that negatively influenced on country’s economic growth, which confirmed that contractionary monetary policy is ineffective to stabilize country’s economic growth. The trade linearization policies hurt Pakistan’s economic growth, which invalidate the positive effect of globalization in developing countries. The inbound FDI has a positive impact on economic growth, whereas exchange rate and changes in price level both have a negative impact on inbound FDI in a country. The domestic saving rate substantially increases inbound FDI in a country. The positive impact of money supply on inflation confirmed the monetarist view of inflation, i.e., money supply leads to inflation. Thus, the overall conclusion confirmed the sound viability of expansionary monetary policy in a given country for sustained growth.

AB  - This paper uses 13,766 firm-year observations between 2003 and 2013 from China to investigate the effects of monetary policy on corporate investment and the mitigating effects of cash holding. We find that tightening monetary policy reduces corporate investment while cash holdings mitigate such adverse effects. The cash mitigating role is especially significant for financially constrained firms, non-state-owned enterprises (non-SOEs) and those firms located in a less developed financial market. Cash holding also improves investment efficiency when monetary policy is tightening and tightening monetary policy enhances the ‘cash-cash flow’ sensitivity. Our empirical evidence calls for a critical evaluation on the monetary policies implemented in China which are less effective for state-owned enterprises. It also calls for a necessity for local government to further develop regional financial markets to protect vulnerable businesses, such as non-SOEs and financially constrained firms, from external shocks in order to maintain their sustainable growth and competitive advantages.

AB  - A significant proportion of the trade basket of many developing countries is comprised of primary commodities. This implies relative price movements in commodities may have important consequences for economic growth and poverty reduction. Taking a long-run perspective, we examine the historical relation between a new aggregate index of commodity prices, economic activity, and interest rates. Initial empirical tests show that commodity prices present a downward trend with breaks over the entire industrial age, providing clear support for the Prebisch–Singer hypothesis. It would also appear that this trend has declined at a faster rate since the 1870s. Conversely, several GDP series such as World, Chile, China, UK, and US, trend upward with breaks. Such trending behavior in both commodity prices and economic activity suggests a latent common factor like technological innovation. To assess the relationships between economic series, we apply a stationary VAR (Vector Autoregression) to model movements around trends. Strikingly, there is evidence that commodity prices Granger cause income and interest rates, while interest rates Granger cause commodity prices. From these results and the related impulse response function analysis, the historical perspective provides some useful information for contemporary policy makers. For example, loose monetary policy has tended to support higher commodity prices. Moreover, commodity price movements have an asymmetric country effect on economic activity; periods of falling commodity prices will support GDP growth for commodity importers like the US but depress growth for commodity exporters such as Chile.

AB  - The aim of this paper is to present an estimation about the evolution of the monetary policy transmission mechanism in Romania over a specific period of time, by using a time-varying vector autoregression model. Impulse responses to a monetary policy shock are computed and sign restrictions are used in order to identify a monetary policy shock. The assumption that is being used as a starting point is that a monetary policy shock is the one that leads to an increase of the interest rates and in the same time to a decrease in inflation and output growth. The aim of this study is to observe whether the impulse response functions show evidence of significant variation across time. The importance of analyzing this phenomenon comes from the importance of ensuring price stability as long as sustainable economic growth for Central Banks.

TI  - A Keynesian factor in monetary policy: the Economic Growth Incentive Method (EGIM)
AU  - De Koning, Kees
AB  - In the U.S. over the past 17 years competition among banks to provide home mortgages has failed. The reason is that there is a finite need for new housing starts at around 1.8 million homes per year and that there is a finite need for funds if house prices are to move in line with the CPI inflation index. In 1997 new home mortgage funds of $125,260 were allocated for each new home, with a median house price level of $145,900. The turning point was already reached in 1998 and in 2006 home mortgage funds per new home had grown to $574,550. In 2006 on basis of the CPI index for new homes, not 1.8 million but nearly 5.5 million new homes could have been build; way above the need.

Over the period 1998-2007 the economic value of the output achieved with the money input had dropped considerably and the indebtedness of new mortgagees had increased dramatically. Both were a cause of a slow down in economic growth. The funding bubble burst in 2007.

The actions taken by the Federal Reserve saved the banks- bar one- and other financial institutions, but the Fed did not address the financial plight of individual households. Quantitative easing bought up $2.4 trillion of past government debt, which helped lower long-term interest rates. What was not considered was to give a cash injection to individual households to be repaid out of future tax revenues. Such tax advance should not be personalized but repaid to the Fed out of future general tax revenues over a period of say 10 years: the Economic Growth Incentive Method. A Keynesian factor can be introduced into monetary policies. The U.S. has gone through a six-year adjustment period since the beginning of 2008 in order to get back to economic growth. The Eurozone has not achieved the same result. The EGIM method would be very helpful for the Eurozone countries.

AB  - The study examined the effect of monetary policy instruments on banking sector credits in Nigeria. The researcher employed three price-based monetary policy tools including monetary policy rate, cash reserve ratio, Treasury bill rate while liquidity ratio was also introduced as a control variable. Data analyses involved Augmented Dicker-Fuller (ADF) unit roots test, Johansson co-integration test, Vector Error Correction model and Impulse Response Function (IRF). The Co-integration result showed that there is long run relationship between monetary policy tools and bank credit such that MPR and LIQ has significant positive long run effects while TBR and CRR had significant negative long run effects on bank credit in Nigeria. The Vector Error Correction Mechanism (ECM) showed that monetary policy in Nigeria is a reliable short term mechanism for controlling the banks in Nigeria vis-à-vis financial intermediation functions. The impulse response function has shown that all the monetary policy variables (MPR, CRR, TBR and LIQ) have negative effects on bank propensity to grant credit in Nigeria. The study generally recommends that price-based monetary policy tools should be used in short term regulation stance of the government.

TI  - Monetary policy transmission mechanism in Fiji: an empirical analysis of the quarterly model

AB  - Fiji’s central bank, the Reserve Bank of Fiji (RBF) since its inception in 1983, has been pursuing monetary policy with the mandated objectives of economic growth with price stability and an adequate level of exchange reserves. In 1988, as part of financial sector reforms, RBF discontinued the use of direct instruments and switched on to employment of indirect instruments for influencing interest rates. For the past two decades, RBF has been conducting regular open
market type operations in its own paper, known as RBF Notes for liquidity management. The yield to maturity of its
91-day RBF Notes determined through tender system, known as policy indicator rate (PIR) signals the monetary policy
stance of RBF. This paper undertakes an empirical study of transmission mechanism of monetary policy over a 17–year
period (1990Q1-2006Q4). Using variance decomposition and impulse response analysis, we find that money channel is
the most important one amongst the four channels of transmission mechanism investigated.

TI  - Monetary Policy in a Schumpeterian Growth Model with Two R&D Sectors
AU  - Huang, Chien-Yu

AU  - Yang, Yibai
AU  - Zheng, Zhijie
AB  - We explore the growth and welfare effects of monetary policy in a two-sector Schumpeterian economy with cash-in-advance (CIA) constrained R&D investment in both sectors. We show that a nominal interest rate increase generates two effects on equilibrium labor allocation: a manufacturing-R&D-reallocation effect and a cross-R&D-sector effect. The former reduces economic growth by shifting labor from R&D to production, whereas the latter can enhance it by shifting labor from the less productive R&D sector to the more productive one. Unless the high productivity R&D sector is severely more CIA-constrained than the low productivity one, aggregate R&D overinvestment is sufficient but not necessary for the Friedman rule of monetary policy to be suboptimal. Our benchmark parameterization suggests that a positive nominal interest rate is optimal despite that it exacerbates the aggregate R&D underinvestment problem.

TI  - Monetary vs. Fiscal Policy: An Empirical Investigation in Tanzania, 1966–2013
AU  - Mkupete, Mkupete Jaah
AU  - Ndanshau, Michael O A
AB  - This study examines the relative importance of fiscal and monetary policy on economic growth in Tanzania by using quarterly time series data for the period 1966: I to 2013: IV. The hypotheses tested are that fiscal rather than monetary policy tools exert a relatively stronger and larger influence on economic activity; and the impact of fiscal policy is more predictable than that of monetary policy. The analysis was based on the original and a modified St. Louis equation in the form of a Distributed Lag Model estimated by using the Restricted Vector Autoregressive (VAR) model and Autoregressive Distributed Lag (ARDL) technique. The study finds that monetary policy tools, measured by money supply, had a relatively stronger, larger and predictable impact on economic growth than fiscal policy, measured by government expenditure. Also, the shocks associated with changes in money supply were larger than the shocks due to changes in fiscal policy. However, over the short-run the shock due to changes in fiscal policy on economic activity was larger; and that of monetary policy was larger over the long-run. The estimation results suggest that the modified St. Louis equation was more superior to its original form. The results suggest the relative dominance of monetary over fiscal policy, implying that stabilization policy can be successfully pursued by the former rather than the latter policy. However, either of the policy should not be used exclusively because even fiscal policy is found to have an effect on growth, at least over the short-run period.

TI  - The asymmetric impacts of monetary policy on housing prices: A viewpoint of housing price rigidity
AU  - Tsai, I-Chun
T2  - Economic Modelling
AB  - Previous studies have discovered the defensive characteristics of housing prices, which is also known as downward price rigidity. This paper discusses whether this feature would result in an asymmetric relationship between housing prices and monetary policy. This paper first uses the loss aversion behavior of traders to assess the viability of housing price rigidity in the housing market and to deduce further that if downward housing price rigidity actually existed, then the impact of monetary policy on housing prices should be asymmetric. For empirical tests, this paper uses data from the UK housing market and then uses the money supply as the proxy variable of monetary policy. The relationships between these two variables are observed. This paper performs estimation using both traditional and threshold error correction models by comparing the coefficients of both models. The results indicate that housing price is indeed asymmetrically adjusted to money supply. When housing prices increase to reflect a loose monetary policy, a modification behavior is evident. Conversely, housing prices cannot easily reflect a tight monetary policy. This result indicates that housing prices tend to overreact in upturn and underreact in downturn. The results imply that when implementing relevant policies for the housing market, the government should consider the asymmetry of housing price changes. Otherwise, the situation can easily result in the creation of a bubble or the collapse of the housing market because of incorrect policies.

TI  - Stock market, economic growth and EU accession: evidence from three CEECs

T2  - International Journal of Monetary Economics and Finance
AB  - This paper estimates a bivariate VAR–GARCH (1,1) model to examine linkages between the stock market and economic growth in three CEEC countries (the Czech Republic, Hungary and Poland). The empirical findings suggest that there is unidirectional causality running from stock markets to growth in the levels; this linkage becoming stronger following EU accession, which appears to have been beneficial, presumably as a catalyst for institutional building and development. The same holds in most cases for volatility spillovers as well. In addition, Germany is confirmed to act as a locomotive for these countries, and a tight monetary policy is found to affect both economic and stock market growth adversely.

AB  - The European Central Bank started to stimulate the European economies in 2009 since the countries of the European Union have been facing the low growth and low inflation after both the global financial and sovereign debt crisis The aim of the paper is to evaluate the effects of very low and negative interest rates on financial position of manufacturing firms in the Slovak Republic with the use of balance sheet channel. The results confirm that firm-specific determinants affect the capital structure of firms. When assessing the impact of monetary policy on financial structure in the environment of low interest rates, our findings support the existence of balance sheet channel in the Slovak Republic, that is apparent in short-term structure.

TI  - RE-EVALUATION OF THE IMPACT OF MONETARY POLICY ON AGRICULTURAL OUTPUT IN NIGERIA
AU  - Nwosu, Mukosolu Jennifer
AB  - This research work is an empirical effort attempted to re-evaluate the impact of monetary policy on agricultural output with annual secondary data from 1980 to 2015 sourced from Central Bank of Nigeria Statistical Bulletin. The ordinary least square techniques was employed for its estimation. The result shows that the independent variables interest rate, cash reserve ratio and deposit money bank credit to agriculture have  significant impact on the Agricultural sector in Nigeria which means that monetary policy instruments is relevant to agricultural. From the study the government is advised to seek a proper role for monetary policy in promoting strong and sustainable growth in a stable macroeconomic environment in Nigeria through monetary authority also the government should advocate for a moderate interest rate which is needed for a sustainable economic growth and development.
