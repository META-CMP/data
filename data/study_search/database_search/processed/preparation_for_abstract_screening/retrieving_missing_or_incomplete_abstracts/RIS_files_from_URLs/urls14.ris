AB  - The study examined the impact of monetary policy innovations on growth rate of output in Nigeria. This study utilized times series data within the period of 1985 to 2012 which was sourced from the statistical bulletin of Central Bank of Nigeria, Nigerian Investment Promotion Commission (NIPC) and Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The study employed Vector Autoregressive (VAR) estimation technique in the analysis of data. The result showed that money supply exerts significant influence on growth of output in Nigeria while exchange rate and interest rate were insignificant. The study recommended that exchange rate and interest rate should be regulated. It also suggested the need for monetary authorities to implement policy that effectively enhanced money supply.

T2  - PLANNING MALAYSIA
AB  - Housing affordability is a global concern, especially among researchers and policymakers around the world in both developed and developing countries. In Malaysia, it has been a decade since the median multiple house price reaching more than a tripled median household income threshold in term of housing affordability. This indicates that housing in Malaysia is seriously unaffordable. In general, this study was conducted to examine the impact of monetary policy on housing affordability in Malaysia. This study focuses on investigating both short and long-run relationships between money supply and interest rate on housing affordability. To achieve this goal, Autoregressive Distributed Lag (ARDL) estimation techniques were employed on a quarterly data from the first quarter of 2008 until the first quarter of 2021. The findings showed the existence of long-run cointegration between all indicators except for the interest rate. In addition, money supply, interest rate, and employment were found to be significant in the short run. In the matter of policy implication, it is best for policymakers to focus on regulating money supply rather than controlling interest rate in promoting housing affordability.

T2  - Studies in Economics and Finance
AB  - Purpose The purpose of this paper is to assess the effect of securitization on US bank lending and monetary policy transmission. Design/methodology/approach The authors use a sample of 174 US commercial banks from 2001 to 2008 and regress the ratio of total loans per total assets on variables related to securitization activity, variables related to bank-specific characteristics, economic growth and monetary policy, as well as interaction terms that are the product of this variable with securitization and bank-specific characteristics. GLS and SUR techniques are used. Findings The results show that a greater recourse to securitization is associated with an increase of US bank lending capacities. Furthermore, it makes banks (especially less liquid ones) less sensitive to a monetary tightening. The authors conclude that when securitization is used as a risk management tool, the efficacy of monetary actions is confirmed. However, when securitization is considered as a substitute for liquid assets, monetary actions become ineffective. So, an increase in federal rates cannot, in this case, affect bank lending. Originality/value The paper contributes to a better understanding of how securitization affects bank lending and the effectiveness of monetary policy. The volume of securitized assets should now be considered as a part of traditional liquidity measures.

On using new macroeconomic theory and multivariate cointegration procedure, this study demonstrates empirically that there exists a positive long-run relationship between aggregate defense spending and aggregate output in Turkey. In addition, the CUSUM and CUSUMSQ tests confirm the stability of the aggregate output function. The results obtained from this study are, by and large, in line with the previous studies concerning Turkey.

AB  - To reveal the effect of monetary policy on corporate financing, this study compared the effect of tightened monetary policy on bank loans and commercial credit financing for real estate companies and manufacturing companies. We further analyzed the land purchase behaviors of typical real estate companies under different monetary policies. The results indicated the following: (1) The effects of monetary policy were heterogeneous among different industries. Tightened monetary policy significantly inhibited the financing scale of manufacturing companies in terms of both bank loans and commercial credit, but it had no effect on real estate companies. (2) The phenomenon of financing discrimination was found to exist among listed Chinese companies. Bank credit preference for state-owned enterprises was demonstrated for both the real estate and manufacturing industries. Lastly, (3) when positive expectations regarding real estate market development were not changed, government intervention through monetary policy was ineffective. These findings can provide a reference for real estate market regulation and credit allocation. The government should seek to change overly positive expectations regarding housing prices and strengthen the construction of a prudential regulation system to avoid the systemic financial risks caused by the real estate market. Meanwhile, it is necessary to relax the financing constraints of private enterprises and change the soft budget constraints of state-owned enterprises to eliminate credit discrimination.

AB  - In response to the empirical anomalies relating to the use of VAR models in analysing the impact of monetary policy shocks, the Factor-Augmented VAR (FAVAR) models attempt to provide a practical solution. Moreover, these models, based on dynamic factor models (DFM), make it possible to summarize the information present in a large database into a small number of factors common to all the variables. In this paper, we analyse the effects of monetary policy shocks on economic growth using the FAVAR model on a large number of Moroccan macroeconomic time series (117 quarterly time series from 1985Q1 to 2018Q4). First, we present the econometric framework of the FAVAR model, then the data used and their necessary transformations. Next, we determine the number of factors before estimating the model. Then, we focus on the analysis of the impulse response functions of some indicators of economic growth in Morocco. The results of the analysis indicate that, the overall decline in GDP in response to monetary policy shocks suggests that they have a clearly negative impact on economic growth.

TI  - Monetary policy in Lebanon
AU  - Daher, Nassar
AB  - This study is focused on the application of the monetary policy instruments in Lebanon throughout the 1993-2002 period and their impact on the Lebanese economy, namely the business cycle.
Theoretically, we survey the techniques of monetary control and identify the process whereby these techniques might affect the macroeconomic behavior. Theories of how to conduct the monetary policy view the latter as an economic instrument which uses money
supply and interest rates as intermediate objectives to help achieve a healthy business cycle-growth in output, low unemployment and low inflation. Empirically, we identify the techniques of the monetary policy applied in Lebanon during the years 1993-2002 and analyze their impact on the macroeconomic situation. We provide evidence that neither economic growth nor unemployment reduction were
considered as ultimate targets for the monetary authority in Lebanon. Since 1993, the Lebanese monetary policy has been targeted at maintaining strength and stability in the exchange rate, controlling the inflation rate, and most importantly, financing the current expenses of the public sector. Moreover, interest rates that are supposed to be
consequences of the application of the monetary policy instruments were artificially manipulated by the Lebanese Government to achieve its targets. High interest rates on treasury bills discouraged private investment in the productive sectors of the Lebanese economy. Most foreign and local capital was invested in highyield government bonds rather than in high-value economic growth and employment-promoting activities. This was the major contributor to the decline in lending opportunities to the productive sectors and to the allocation of larger national resources to bondholders-the majority from wealthy and high-income classes. Monetary policy in Lebanon constituted a major obstacle to productive investment and consequently to economic growth and unemployment reduction. This study provides
evidence in favor of this argument confirming that the recent economic crisis in Lebanon is the result of the bad application of the monetary policy instruments throughout the 1993-2002 period.

TI  - Fiscal and Monetary Policy on Economic Growth
AU  - C, Shu
T2  - European Research Studies Journal
AB  - This paper contributes to the debate between the monetarists and fiscalists concerning the relative effectiveness of monetary and fiscal policy. Employing data from 16 Asian and Latin American countries, it sheds new light on the debate by attempting to address two questions. First, which set of policies is more effective in affecting the sources of economic growth and promoting growth? Second, does the interaction between relative competence of policies and policy competence have implications on economic growth. The work reveals that in this group of countries there does not seem to be a prevailing rule as to which set of policies is more important in determining economic growth. The interaction between policy relative effectiveness and policy competence also appears to present a mixed picture. In some countries which have achieved sustained fast growth, the more successful set of policies is also more effective. However there are cases where policy is reasonably competent and the more successful set of policies is more effective, and yet the economy has a disastrous growth performance, and cases where policy conduct is largely adequate and the worse set of policy exerts more influence, and yet the economy accomplishes reasonable growth.

T2  - The Quarterly Journal of Austrian Economics
AB  - Austrian business cycle theory has been criticized on the basis of “rational expectations.” That is, reasonably high quality entrepreneurs—which are required for economic growth—should be able to foresee the business cycle and thereby avoid making malinvestments. As noted by Evans and Baxendale (2008), this argument ignores the fact that entrepreneurs are heterogeneous in quality. American housing data from the past 25 years suggests that entrepreneurs are more likely to make errors when interest rates are unusually low. This suggests that during the boom either entrepreneurs become foolish—or, as suggested by Evans and Baxendale (2008), fools become entrepreneurs.

AB  - This article provides a fresh insight into the dynamic nexus between oil prices, the Saudi/US dollar exchange rate, inflation, and output growth rate in Saudi Arabia’ economy, using novel Morlet’ wavelet methods. Specifically, it implements various tools of methodology: the continuous wavelet power spectrum, the cross-wavelet power spectrum, the wavelet coherency, the multiple and the partial wavelet coherence to the annual sample period 1969–2014. Our results unveil that the relationships among the variables evolve through time and frequency. From the time-domain view, we show strong but non-homogenous linkages between the four variables. From the frequency-domain view, we uncover significant wavelet coherences and strong lead-lag relationships. From an economic view, the wavelet analysis shows that Saudi economy is still exposed to several global risk factors, which are mainly related to the oil market volatility, and the pegging of the local currency to the US dollar. Such risk factors strongly and negatively affect the real economic growth, exert more pressure on inflation, and substantially limit the freedom to pursue an independent monetary policy.

The model shows that high nominal growth leads to an increase in the market share of innovative firms as menu-cost burdens are relatively heavier for less innovative firms. This reallocation effect yields a positive effect of monetary expansion on both real growth and welfare. The optimal nominal growth can be strictly positive even under nominal rigidity. Moreover, menu costs can improve welfare. Japanese firm-level data are consistent with the model implication in that under higher inflation, large firms grow faster than small firms.

TI  - Monetary Policy Experience of Pakistan
AU  - Hanif, Muhammad Nadim
AB  - Using monetary policy rate and/or changes in certain liquidity ratios, State Bank of Pakistan influences cost and/or availability of money and credit in the country to achieve (government announced) inflation target without being prejudice to real economic growth target. Earlier, SBP had been following monetary aggregate targeting to achieve its objectives. Reserve money had been used as an operational target. After weakening of broad money growth and inflation relation (as a result of financial sector reforms and restructuring), SBP transferred the operational target to the overnight money market repo rate. Various monetary conditions indicators are used to decide on the direction and magnitude of monetary policy stance. Budget deficit (with its financing mix), money supply (with its composition), local currency prices of imported goods, wheat support price, and expected (higher) inflation play an significant role in generating inflation while real income growth, and (international trade) openness help dampening it. Inflation in Pakistan has been found equals to rate of broad money growth minus the real output growth which simply shows inflation in Pakistan has mainly been a monetary phenomenon. Monetary policy has provided stable background for the economy as we saw standard deviations for inflation and broad money growth to be same during 1951-2010. Financial sector reforms and restructuring (after end 1980s) helped lower the (broad money growth and) inflation volatility in the country.

Exacerbating this situation is a monetary policy in crisis as over a decade of generally high interest rates have failed to address inflationary pressures. Thus, the Botswana experience challenges generally accepted wisdom on the relationship between interest rates and inflation. The main lessons learned highlight the need for (i) enhancing the knowledge and information base; (ii) tempering monetary policy to prevailing mores; and (iii) ensuring the provision of good governance at the central bank. Policy and programme recommendations that are offered are relevant not only to Botswana but also to other developing countries that face similar challenges.

T2  - Pacific-Basin Finance Journal
AB  - This research investigates the role that China's monetary policy has played in maintaining financial stability after crises in the 21st century. We construct a financial stability index (FSI) with eight variables from four characteristics that reflect variations in the financial stability of China, and analyze the dynamic impacts of China's monetary policies on financial stability with a time-varying parameter vector-autoregressive (TVP-VAR) model. The three major crises that China has been involved in the past 15 years (i.e., the 2008 global financial crisis, 2015 stock market crash in China, and the ongoing COVID-19 crisis) indicate that the scale of social financing, stock market performance, and the degree of financial deepening in China have great influences on financial stability. We observe supportive evidence, moreover, that both quantitative and price-based monetary policies can promote financial stability after crises in China, especially in the short term. The quantitative policy is more effective than price-based monetary policy and has become the main policy tool in China. At a time when the world economy is still suffering from the COVID-19 crisis, the quick economic recovery is an imperative task for all countries. It is of great theoretical and practical significance to understand the relationship between monetary policy and financial stability after crises.

AB  - The transmission mechanism of monetary policy is the medium to connect monetary factors and real economy. The impact of the policy can lead to various variables change in the process of economic. In recent years, the research on monetary policy to the transmission mechanism of real estate price has become a hot issue. The monetary policy as a regulation of the Chinese real estate price basic tools. So research and design the mechanism of money supply and interest rate level play an important role in economic. How to make the monetary policy can not only make the consumption and investment stability, but also makes the real estate bubble has decreased. Ultimately achieve the healthy and stable economic growth target .And becomes the focus of policy making. This paper will first use the ANOVA to examine the interaction between money supply and interest rates. Finally, using the VAR model to calculate the weight of each factor.

AB  - Inflation in the euro area has been significantly below its target level since the end of 2013. This can be passed on to long-term inflation expectations and is a reflection of the very progressive recovery. At a time when price stability was coming under threat, the Eurosystem embarked on a new phase of monetary accommodation in the summer of 2014, marked notably by massive purchases of government securities and negative policy rates. According to Eurosystem estimates, the asset purchase programme and the other non-standard measures taken since 2014 are expected to have an effect on average annual inflation of around 0.5 percentage point over the period 2015-2018 and a cumulative effect on the economic growth of the euro area of about 1.6 percentage points by 2018.

AB  - This study investigated the effects of monetary policy on JSE portfolios using a GARCH(1,1) framework. Results for the period 1990 - 2009 were compared with those based on four sub-periods. The analysis shows that discount rate changes are important in describing mean returns and return volatilities. The significance of these effects varies during different states of the economy; according to the definition of the market portfolio; and depending on whether or not the asymmetric effects of monetary policy changes are modelled. The effects of positive and negative policy changes are somewhat asymmetric on the JSE.

AB  - Macroeconomic data for G7 countries during 1959-2005 were analyzed to examine the asymmetric effects of monetary and government spending policies on economic growth. A key feature of this study is analysis of the changing distribution of real GDP across countries and over time by quantile regression (QR) model and comparison of the results with OLS and LAD estimates. The empirical results of this model differ from those obtained by OLS and LAD estimates since the QR method processes more information from the sample distribution. The nonlinearities derived from conditional QR revealed considerable differences, including differences in sign and in the magnitude of the two government policies on real output across various business cycle stages.

AB  - Monetary policy is expected to affect the real economy through transmission mechanism of selected channel in accordance to the changes in the global development of the domestic economy, such as credit channel, exchange rate channel, and asset price channel. The aim of this study was
to examine the effect of monetary policy on aggregate output and sectoral output of the Indonesian economy by using vector auto regression (VAR) model. Based on quarterly data covering the period of 2000.1 to 2014.4, we found that the effect of monetary policy surprise at the sectoral level
is heterogeneous. Some sectors are more sensitive and some others are less susceptible to monetary policy surprise. In order to achieve the desired objectives of monetary policy, we showed that there is a need of certain monetary policy to some sectors which are more focused in Indonesia.
Indonesia’s economic growth and effect of monetary policy through transmission mechanism also need to be seen from expectation channel.

AB  - We provide a new method to model changes in monetary policy of the Bank of England (BoE) as well as the impact of these changes on UK economy. This is important as central bankers have widened the range of instruments in their monetary policy toolbox. Specifically, we estimate a proxy for the monetary policy stance and then analyse a time-varying parameter vector autoregressive with stochastic volatility model to explain the BoE’s trade-offs when making policy decisions and as well as to demonstrate dynamic impacts of monetary policy on inflation and economic growth. The empirical results show that our estimated monetary policy proxy is better at capturing the BoE’s policy when the interest rate lower bound becomes binding.

AB  - This study examined the effect of monetary policy variables, financial deepening indicators and Nigeria economic growth from 1981-2018. Time series data was sourced from Central Bank of Nigeria Statistical bulletin and publications of Nigeria Bureau of Statistics. Real gross domestic products was proxy for dependent variables while the independent variables were Monetary Policy Rate, Treasury bill ratio, Treasury certificate ratio, Percentage of money supply to gross domestic product and Percentage of credit to private sector to Gross domestic products. Ordinary least square methods of cointegration, granger causality test, unit root test and Vector error correction model. The estimated regression model I shows that the effects of monetary policy variables proved 81.8 percent variations in percentage of real gross domestic products can be explained by the changes in the explanatory variables. Monetary policy rate and treasury certificate are positively related to Nigeria real gross domestic products while treasury bill rate is negatively related to the dependent variable. The estimated regression model II that 75.7 percent of variation in Nigeria real gross domestic products is explained by variations in independent variables while the remaining 24.3 percent of the variation in the model is captured by the error term, and the estimated regression line above, the results show that M2/GDP is positive while CPS/GDP have a negative impact but statistically insignificant over Nigeria real gross domestic products. From the findings, the study concludes that monetary policy variables and financial deepening indicators have significant effect on Nigeria economic growth in the post structural adjustment programme. This study recommends that the monetary policy of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) should be directed to deepen the financial sector.

AB  - Many emerging markets have undertaken significant financial sector reforms, especially in their banking sectors, that are critical for both financial development and real economic activity. In this paper, we investigate the success of banking reforms in India where significant banking reforms were implemented during the 1990s. Using the argument that well-functioning credit markets would reflect a credit channel for monetary policy at work, we test whether a change in monetary policy has a predictable impact on borrowing behaviour of several types of firms, including business group affiliated, unaffiliated private firms, state-owned firms and foreign firms. The empirical results suggest that unaffiliated private firms have the most vulnerable to monetary policy stance during tight policy regimes. We also find that during tight monetary policy regimes, bank credit of smaller firms is more sensitive to changes in the interest rate than that of large firms. In an easy money regime, monetary policy and the associated change in interest rate does not affect change in bank credit, change in total debt and the proportion of bank credit in total debt for any of the firms. We discuss the policy implications of the findings.

TI  - EFFECTIVE MONETARY POLICY AS A RECIPE FOR MACROECONOMIC STABILITY IN NIGERIA
AU  - Olusegun, Joseph
AB  - The basic objective of this paper was to investigate effective monetary policy as a recipe for macroeconomic stability in Nigeria, using annual time series data from 1981 to 2014. The paper employs OLS methodology with all the BLUE assumption. The results show that considering the magnitude, 1% increase in RGDP (proxy for economic growth) is brought about by 0.86% increase in narrow money supply (M1), 0.63% increase in broad money supply (M2), 258% decrease in inflation rate (INFLARATE), 1276.3% increase in lending rate (LEDRATE), and 143.9% increase in gross fixed capital formation. This implies that an increase in lending rate and other related variables will lead to a significant increase in real GDP, proxy for economic growth in Nigeria. The estimated value of R2 (goodness of fit) of 0.67 or 67% shows that 67% systematic variation in Real GDP is caused by variation in narrow money supply, broad money supply, inflation rate, lending rate, and gross fixed capital formation. This indicates that indeed, monetary policy has an effect on macroeconomic stability in Nigeria. The study seems to suggest that concerted efforts should be made by the government to focus on increment in narrow and broad money supplies which will aid in the financing of the country’s monetary growth, balancing the price increase, stimulating increased spending, and further enhancing the country’s macroeconomic variables.

AB  - This chapter argues that economic growth can also be influenced by monetary policy, although, by monetary policy we have in mind a richer range of policies than simply money supply control. It reviews the orthodox approach to the channels of transmission of monetary policy and deals with the literature on monetary policy in small islands. The chapter explores the possibilities of monetary policies in small open economies. Orthodox monetary theory rules out the possibility for monetary policy to promote economic growth in very small open economies, such as island economies. The discussion about the monetary policy effectiveness usually distinguishes two alternative transmission mechanisms. Most literature on monetary policy in small island economies points out ineffectiveness to promote economic growth. The chapter analyzes how monetary policy can contribute to the development of small island economies. The conclusion that follows then is that small island economies would not have the possibility to implement their own monetary policy.

AB  - The static growth of foreign direct investment since 2006 and current growth per capita of 3.11% in 2015 about 4.89% in 1980 spark a growing interest in the role of monetary policy. The unexplored causal relationship between monetary policy, unemployment, foreign direct investment and economic growth in Malaysia represents a zone of the request, as it could spell issues for these countries in their arrangement in accomplishing growth per capita. This study plan to examine the dynamic relationship between monetary policy and economic growth for Malaysia during 1980-2015. It contended that presence of the structural break in the data generating process prompts to size distortion and false conclusion in the ADF model (Perron, 1989 and Lee and Strazicich, 2003). Henceforth, this study begins with testing for stationarity properties which consider structural breaks notwithstanding the conventional ADF test. We agree with the monetarist that changes in the money supply do not affect real variables over the long haul as no evidence of causality from inflation to output nor any causality from money supply to price level from this study. Instead of the money supply, results from VAR Granger Causality found that interest rate observed to granger caused growth per capita, money supply, inflation, unemployment and foreign direct investment. This study demonstrates that changing approach of monetary policy in Malaysia from monetary targeting to interest rates targeting, in fact, a fruitful execution. We found evidence of bidirectional causality between unemployment and growth per capita in this study also in line with Mohd Noor et al., (2007). Here, we propose that Malaysia needs to elevate foreign direct investment in term of expanding growth per capita as upheld by the result of VAR granger causality where foreign direct investment found to granger caused unemployment and growth.

AB  - This paper surveys the particularities of monetary policy as a powerful governmental weapon in countries with transitional economies. The paper combines the theoretical analysis with empirical studies. Because in transitional economies the particular channels of monetary policy are diverse, continually changing, and uncertain reduce-form evidence are used to evaluate the empirical evidence. The brief view of relationships between movement in money supply (M1 and M2) and output level (nominal GDP) in Georgia illustrates the close correlation between them. Georgian economy like others transitional economies suffers from "Great Transitional Depression" and macroeconomic equilibrium occurs at recessionary gap. In transition countries initially supply is more elastic and elasticity increases more rapidly than that in developed countries. In these circumstances expansionary monetary policy effects real aggregate economy stimulating economic growth with mild inflation. In industrialized countries accommodating discretionary monetary policy entails cost-push inflation without any change in long-run GDP.

This is due to the fact that in recent years in our country it has not been possible to ensure the investment attractiveness of financial assets, including shares, due to rising prices and high rates of depreciation of the national currency. The high growth rates of the money supply in recent years have undoubtedly stimulated the expansion of effective demand and contributed to the maintenance of positive GDP growth rates (although this has not always been possible). The current macroeconomic situation, including the current dynamics of inflation and forecast indicators, as well as the need to ensure stable and balanced economic growth, requires the central bank to take concrete and more effective measures to ensure price stability.

AB  - Sustainable economic growth and development is undoubtly, one of the most challenging issue nowadays, in the developing countries, particularly in Pakistan. Therefore, economists mainly focus on the importance of the fiscal, monetary and trade policies in escalating economic growth. This study investigate empirically the impact of fiscal, monetary and trade policies on economic growth of Pakistan, employing ARDL bounds test approach. From an evaluation of the overall analysis and results, it is concluded that, on fiscal policy variables side, development expenditure have positive and significant effect, while, current expenditure have also significant but negative effect on economic growth. On monetary policy variable side, money supply have also positive and significant effect on economic growth. Finally, on trade policy variable side, trade openness have positive and significant effect on economic growth. The results of this study confirm the finding of most previous study, since the advent of the endogenous growth theory and new trade theory. The study suggest that the level of fiscal policy variables, development expenditure could be effectual while current expenditure has been detrimental to economic growth. In the same way, on monetary policy variable side the level of money supply could also be effectual in an augmenting economy. Finally, the level of trade policy variable, trade openness could be effectual in managing economic growth.

The results indicate that various economic factors including initial conditions, investment, population growth, trade orientation, inflation, financial development, and the growth of the government sector contribute significantly to economic growth. In addition to economic variables, we find the degree of political freedom to be a significant contributor to economic growth. Finally, we find some evidence that economic growth by the members of the CFA Franc Zone has not fared well in comparison to other African countries.

TI  - The Impact of Monetary Policy on Price and Exchange Rate Stability in Suriname
AU  - Jahangir-Abdoelrahman, Saira
T2  - Social and Economic Studies
AB  - In general, monetary policy as an instrument of macroeconomic management is aimed at promoting price stability, full employment, economic growth and balance of payments equilibrium. In small open economies, however, exchange rate stability becomes a prime concern of the central bank because of its high correlation with price stability. The commercial banks, which constitute the core of the financial system, directly influence price and exchange rate stability through their domestic credit supply, while their impact on the other macroeconomic objectives is more indirect. Previously, the Central Bank of Suriname had restricted credit expansion by imposing credit ceilings on the commercial banks, which limited credit growth in line with increase of long-term resources. This implies that commercial banks are not allowed to create money which, given the economic situation in Suriname, is consistent with the balance of payments objective. As commercial bank credit is an intermediate target of monetary policy, the Central Bank does not influence interest rates directly. However, due to high inflation in the recent past, interest rates became increasingly negative in real terms, leading to capital flight and further depreciation of the national currency. To counter these developments the Central Bank succesfully started issuing its own securities offering positive real interest rates, while simultaneously intervening in the foreign exchange market. D'une manière générale, la politique monétaire en tant qu'instrument de gestion macroéconomique a pour but la promotion de la stabilité des prix, le plein emploi, la croissance économique et l'équilibre de la balance des paiements. Dans les petites économies ouvertes, cependant, la stabilité des taux de change devient une préoccupation principale de la banque centrale à cause de sa forte corrélation avec la stabilité des prix. Les banques commerciales, qui constituent le noyau du système financier, inflencent directement la stabilité des prix et des taux de change à cause de leur offre de crédit national alors que leur effet sur les autres objectifs macroéconomiques est plus indirect. Auparavant la Banque Centrale de Suriname avait restreint l'expansion des crédits en imposant des plafonds de crédit aux banques commerciales qui limitaient la croissance de crédit dans le cadre de l'augmentation des ressources à long termes. Cela signifie qu'on ne permet pas aux banques commerciales de créer de l'argent qui, étant donné la situation économique à Suriname, est compatible avec l'objectif de la balance de paiements. Comme le crédit des banques commerciales est un indicatif intermédiaire de politique monétaire, la Banque Centrale n'influence pas les taux d'intérêt directement. Cependant, à cause du taux élevé d'inflation au cours des temps derniers, les taux d'intérêt sont devenus de plus en plus négatifs en termes réels, et cela a conduit à une fuite de capitaux et une plus grande dépréciation de la devise nationale. Pour déjouer ces développements, la Banque Centrale a commencé à émettre, avec succès, ses propres valeurs offrant des taux d'intérêt interessants, tout en intervenant simultanément dans le marché des devises étrangères. Por regla general, la política monetaria como un instrumento de administración macroeconómica, se propone la promoción de la estabilidad de precios, empleo total, crecimiento económico y equilibrio del balance de pago. No obstante, en las pequeñas economías abiertas, la estabilidad de la tasa de cambio es de importancia primordial al banco central, debido a su alta correlación con la estabilidad de precios. Los bancos comerciales que constituyen el núcleo del sistema financiero, ejerce influencia directa sobre la estabilidad de la tasa de cambio y precios mediante su suministro de crédito doméstico, mientras que su impacto sobre los otros objectivos macroeconómicos es más indirecto. Previamente, el Banco Central de Suriname limitó la expansión del crédito mediante la imposición de límites de crédito de acuerdo con el aumento de recursos de largo plazo. Esto implica que los bancos comerciales no son permitidos de crear dinero, que dado la situación económica en Suriname, es consistente con el objetivo del balance de pago. Como el crédito de bancos comerciales es objetivo intermediario de la política monetaria, el Banco Central no ejerce influencia directa sobre las tasas de interés. No obstante, recientemente debido a la alta inflación las tasas de intereses fueron cada vez negativas en términos reales, conduciendo a la huída de capital y además, la depreciación de la moneda nacional. Para contrarrestrar estos desarrollos, el Banco Central comenzó con éxito, la emisión de sus propias seguridades, ofreciendo reales tasas de intereses positivas, mientras intervino simultaneamente en el mercado de divisas.

AB  - This chapter attempts to evaluate the costs or benefits of relying on forecasts when choosing monetary aggregate policy actions. From the earliest systematic writings on monetary theory, writers have observed a relation between money and the price level. Neutrality remains a central proposition for all monetary theory. In principle, government can increase economic welfare by providing the optimal rate of monetary expansion and inflation. For the United States, there are a large number of public and private forecasts of quarterly and annual data. An international rule for compatible monetary policies creates a public good. Smaller countries could choose to import enhanced price and exchange rate stability by fixing their exchange rate to a basket of the currencies of major countries or to one of those currencies. The solution is to make the monetary authority accountable for its actions without making it subservient to elected officials.

TI  - Monetary Transmission Mechanism in Nigeria: A Causality Test
AU  - Ishioro, Bernhard Ozofere
T2  - Mediterranean Journal of Social Sciences
AB  - For decades the major focus of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) has been the formulation and implementation of monetary policies on how to achieve the macroeconomic goals of low inflation, interest rate and exchange rate regulation, and sustained economic growth. But the real sector of the Nigerian economy has performed poorly in terms of sustainable economic growth, low inflation and stable interest and exchange rates. This has resulted in a erratically stable economy; monetary policy-shocks debarred sectors and highly vulnerable macroeconomic aggregates. This study examines the channels of monetary transmission mechanism in Nigeria. The main objective of the study is to identify and validate the existence of some channels of monetary transmission mechanism in the Nigerian context. The study reviewed both the theoretical, empirical and methodological literatures. The Granger causality test was adopted in the estimation of the relationship between the various channels and selected macroeconomic aggregates. Based on the results of our analysis, the study concludes that three channels are functional in Nigeria-the interest rate, exchange rate and the credit channels. We recommend that the exchange rate and interest rate channels should form a fundamental basis for inflation targeting in Nigeria.

AB  - This article examines asymmetric effects of monetary policy on real estate price growth dynamics. We estimate a Markov Switching model using monthly data from 1994 to 2015 for the Colombian house prices’ growth rates. Empirical results suggest that housing price growth has a larger magnitude decrease with a contractionary monetary shock in higher volatility periods than during calm ones, but is not as persistent as in less volatile ones. This suggests that monetary policy is more effective in terms of reducing housing price growth during crisis periods than those when economic conditions are more favorable.

AB  - Almost every country and the European Economic Community, too, wants to have stable prices in its territory and to attain appropriate economic growth and thus full employment. Many economies — industrial and developing countries alike — have succeeded in reducing their inflation rates distinctly in recent years. After the second oil price explosion at the end of the 1970s had been overcome, the rates of economic growth — also of both industrial and developing countries — settled down at around 3 per cent a year. Now, however, the expansionary forces appear to be flagging. At all events, recent economic growth has not been strong enough to solve the main problem currently facing national economies, that is, unemployment. Unemployment rates have remained high. In a number of countries — notably the United States and, to some extent, the Federal Republic of Germany — economic growth rates have exceeded the average. In those nations the unemployment rates have declined. In other countries where economic growth has been below the average, such as France and the United Kingdom, they have risen further.

AB  - The function of monetary and fiscal policies in economic growth is discussed in the present study with the help of yearly data from 1973 to 2014 with reference to Pakistan. The inspiration for the study is that there exists financial insecurity and the modifications to improve the circumstances appear necessary in Pakistan. To test the time series characteristics, the DF and ADF methods are used. The ARDL Model is applied to discover the long-term association among fiscal or monetary policy and economic growth. The study concludes that Currency in Circulation (CIR1), Government Development Expenditures (GDE1), Foreign Exchange Reserves (LFER) and Budget Deficit (BD) are imperative components of GDP in case of Pakistan. The result recommends that GDP is inclined by means of the variables Currency in Circulation, Government Development Expenditures and Foreign Exchange Reserves. The relationship between GDP and the Currency in Circulation found to be negative while, Government Development Expenditures and Foreign Exchange Reserves have positive effect on GDP in Pakistan. It means that the two policies are evenly imperative for development in Pakistan.

TI  - The role of pensions: exploring the link between pension funds, monetary policy and economic performance: a case study of the Netherlands
AU  - Matthíasardóttir, Diljá
AU  - Zarges, Lara
AB  - Shocks to the European Central bank’s unconventional monetary policy trigger Dutch pension funds to search for yield: A structural VAR analysis shows that the pension funds reallocate their asset holdings from bonds towards equity and alternatives. The latter suggests the existence of a portfolio rebalancing channel through institutional investors in the euro area. Moreover, we emphasize that the portfolio reallocation induced by monetary policy has increased the overall riskiness of the funds’ investments, which has potentially systemic risk implications. As the Dutch pension sector has evolved into a key player in financial markets, we additionally investigate the
domestic real effects of a further increase in its size. In this context a second SVAR approach shows that an expansive shock to total asset holdings boosts economic growth. Nevertheless this link also works in the reverse direction and hence points out the potential problems of a sudden dissaving of pension funds. Our case study is restricted to the Netherlands, where the pension sector accounts for almost 200% of GDP, which is an exceptional case in the euro area. However, our results are of general interest for the aging societies in Europe as they improve the understanding of pension funds’ potential importance for economic policy in a period of demographic change.

We use panel data of 36 banks, consisting of 21 public sector banks and 15 private sector banks. The period of analysis is 2004-05 to 2016-17. It is observed that monetary policy shocks have signicant impact on the Tier-I capital of banks through its eect on interest margins and prots. An expansionary policy is found to increase the protability of Indian banks which expands their stock of Tier-I capital. The analysis suggests that bank capital is an important channel to study the transmission mechanism for Indian economy.

AB  - This study examined the extent to which monetary policy has influenced export diversification in Nigeria for the period 1962 to 2014. The study employed descriptive and ordinary least squares techniques. The descriptive analysis revealed that the diversification exercise in Nigeria can only be expressed as average. The regression estimate showed that monetary policy was insignificant in influencing export diversification in Nigeria. The study concluded that monetary policy has not played a fundamental role in enhancing export diversification in Nigeria. The study recommended that monetary policy should be purpose driven towards the achievement of export diversification. This can be achieved by employing selective-sectoral monetary policy measures in accelerating investment in various non-oil sectors of the economy such as the mining, manufacturing and tourism sectors.

AU  - Ndou, Eliphas
T2  - Empirical Economics
AB  - This paper estimates and contrasts the effects of contractionary monetary policy shocks on output in South Africa and South Korea, using a sign restriction VAR approach. I use quarterly data spanning 1980Q1 to 2010Q3. I investigate how much output movements are induced by monetary policy shocks. The main findings reveal that contractionary monetary policy shock significantly depresses real output for many quarters in South Africa. However, output declines insignificantly and transitorily in South Korea, indicating monetary neutrality. I attribute this difference to the transitory responses of both the monetary aggregate M2 and the exchange rate to a monetary policy shock in South Korea compared to South Africa. This implies that each country, despite targeting inflation, has a different monetary policy reaction function. Evidence shows that the monetary policy shocks explain a large portion of fluctuations in output in these emerging market economies compared to those reported for advanced countries by Uhlig (J Monet Econ 52(2):381–419, 2005) and Rafiq and Mallick (J Macroecon 30:1756–1791, 2008). Lastly, I examined the reasonableness of the estimated monetary policy shocks. Evidence indicates that the estimated monetary policy disturbances capture certain monetary policy activities based on selected major historical and recent real-time macroeconomic shocks.

AB  - Monetary policy and financial markets are intrinsically linked. Central banks conduct monetary policy by influencing financial market prices. Financial market prices reflect the expectations of market participants about future economic and monetary developments. Monetary policy works primarily through expectations. Transparency and credibility render monetary policy more effective. However, they are no substitutes for action. If a credible central bank uses words with the explicit aim of substituting them for action, it will risk losing credibility. To avoid what has been described as “the dog chasing its tail” problem, central banks must exercise caution in basing their monetary policy decisions on financial market information. The information about expected future developments reflected in market prices must be continuously cross-checked against economic and monetary indicators in what amounts to a “checks and balances” approach to monetary policy.

The empirical analysis rests on the neo-classical modelling analytical framework and combined several procedures in modern econometric analysis/estimation techniques. Our findings shows that aid flows has significant impact on economic growth in Nigeria: domestic investment increased in response to aid flows and population growth has no significant effect on aid flows. Aid flows also provides free resources to increase domestic investment, thus confirming the aid-policy-growth hypothesis. Therefore, donor governments should be aware of the political situations in recipient countries, and work with international bodies to ensure as much stability as possible. Finally, foreign aid transfers should henceforth pledge to abide by the oath to of doing no harm.

TI  - A Measurement of the Asymmetric Effects of Monetary Policy in Costa Rica
AU  - Mayorga-Martinez, Mauricio
AB  - The main objective of this research is to collect some empirical evidence on the relationship between monetary and real phenomena in the short and long run as well as the possible asymmetric effects of monetary policy. Among the factors that contribute to the asymmetry are changes in expectations, credit restrictions, and price stickiness. For Costa Rica, monetary asymmetry was intended to be captured through the use of vector autoregressions (VARs) applied to the aggregate M1 and two-stage least squares applied to the interest rates. For the former case, there is no significant evidence of a relationship of short-run movements of M1 on real growth and employment. There exists, however, some indication of an impact of changes in M1 upon the interest rates. Regarding the effect of changes, there is an asymmetric impact upon real activity when a two-period lag is used. Regarding monetary policy, these results imply the following: Monetary shocks are an important source of pressure on the aggregate demand; monetary policy may contribute to economic growth through smoothing the impact of monetary shocks; interest rates may become leading indicators of price variations; and finally, pressure groups may be interested in looking for reductions of interest rates. As a conclusion, the research points out the absences of the non-neutrality hypothesis. Variations of M1 exert pressures on real activity through time.

TI  - Estimating the Impact of Monetary Policy on Inequality in China
AU  - Sánchez-Fung, José R.
AB  - ​The paper estimates the impact of monetary policy on income inequality in China. The empirical modelling finds that a battery of monetary indicators, including a monetary overhang measure derived from a money demand equation, and the change in the unemployment rate lead to increases in the Gini coefficient. However, only unemployment is statistically significant. The lack of significance of the monetary indicators is robust to alternative specifications with variability in nominal aggregate demand instead of unemployment.

AB  - The essence of the Islamic economic system is strengthening the real sector. This research aims to analyze the effect of Islamic monetary instrument (such as SBIS, PUAS and Islamic bank financing in the real sector. This research uses the Vector Error Correction Model (VECM) as a method of analysis. The finding revealed that based on the VECM estimation test, in the long term SBIS and Islamic bank financing has a positive effect on the Industrial Production Index (IPI). Meanwhile, PUAS has an adverse effect toward Industrial Production Index (IPI). Besides, based on impulse response function (IRF) test, the shock of SBIS and PUAS responded positively by Industrial Production Index (IPI). Then based on the result of FEVD test, the variable of PUAS in the model of this research has the most significant contribution toward Industrial Production Index (IPI).

AB  - The efficiency of monetary policy substantially depends on the phase of the housing cycle since house prices are important determinants of banks’ willingness to lend. This paper presents evidence on 31 countries which shows that over the pandemic Covid-19 period, in a regime of a strong housing market, the effects of a monetary expansion are smaller than in a regime of low house prices. The findings are important for central banks which have implemented easing monetary policies responding to the Covid-19 pandemic.

TI  - The effect of the ECB’s conventional monetary policy on the real economy: FAVAR-approach
AU  - Laine, Olli-Matti Juhani
T2  - Empirical Economics
AB  - This study applies factor-augmented vector autoregressive models to investigate the effect of the European Central Bank’s (ECB) conventional monetary policy on the real economy. More specifically, the study examines how unanticipated changes in the ECB’s policy rate have affected unemployment rate and industrial production. The effect of monetary policy on unemployment rate and industrial production is estimated to be strong and statistically significant using the data from January 1999 to July 2017 or from the pre-crisis period. However, after the beginning of the crisis the responses weaken drastically and become sometimes statistically insignificant, indicating that the effect of the ECB’s conventional monetary policy became weaker after the financial crisis. This finding is extremely interesting because one could presume either weaker or stronger effect based on economic theory. Additionally, the previous studies that have analysed the possible changes in the monetary policy effectiveness in the euro area have not found any changes (e.g. Bagzibagli in Empir Econ 47(3):781–823, 2014; Von Borstel et al. in Int J Money Finance 68:386–402, 2016).

We combine survey data from Consensus Economics and data on media attention from MarketPsych to distinguish between uncertainty and perceived uncertainty among the public. We assess the corresponding nonlinear effects on stock returns, the growth of industrial production, and inflation. Our results confirm that monetary policy uncertainty tends to have negative effects on production growth and stock returns. In particular for industrial production, such effects tend to be stronger in case of higher media coverage which acts as a propagation mechanism.

T2  - Asian Economic and Financial Review
AB  - The current paper aims to investigate the stability of money demand in the case of Korea. Since the economic reforms in Korea faced considerable structural changes, it was difficult to formulate a stable money demand function. The use of unit root and cointegration tests with structural breaks suggest that economic and financial deregulations have influenced the stability of money demand. The cointegration results suggest a cointegration vector in all models, implying a long-run relationship. Furthermore, the estimated long-run equations show that the elasticity of long-run industrial production to real money is positive and very close to one. Finally, the exogeneity test shows a long-run, one-way, causal relationship from industrial production to M1 and a bi-directional causality between M1 and interest rate in both models. In the case of M3, there are long-run, one-way, causal relationships from industrial production and interest rate to M3 in both models.

AB  - The purpose of this research paper is to find out the empirical relationship between monetary policy initiatives of Reserve Bank of India and industrial production in India since April 1991–1992 to May 2015–2016. Monetary variables are the broad money and weighted average lending rate (WALR), whereas the industrial production variable is Index of Industrial Production (IIP)-manufacturing. Models used are VECM, ARDL-bound test and VAR. The study has found that there is long-run relationship between the broad money supply and IIP-manufacturing, similarly, changes in WALR have significant and immediate impact on the IIP-manufacturing. Based on these empirical results, it is argued that monetary policy variables and production share a strong relationship and policy to control only inflation may adversely impact the production in the economy.

AU  - Cocriş, Vasile

T2  - Baltic Journal of Economics
AB  - The international financial and economic crisis highlights that central banks should go beyond their traditional emphasis on low inflation to adopt an explicit goal of financial stability. Our paper addresses this highly topical issue of macro-prudential framework with the focus on effectiveness of monetary policy in affecting some financial stability indicators, in the experience of several Central and Eastern European countries during 2003M01–2012M06. Using a Structural Vector Autoregressive model and impulse response function, we analyze the impact of short-term interest rates upon industrial production, loan to deposit ratio for the banking system, stock prices and exchange rate (proxy variables for financial stability). We want to test if the interest rate is conducive to financial stability. Our empirical results show that the effectiveness of the short-term interest rate in affecting selected asset prices depends on monetary policy strategy. In the case of the Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland and Romania, the interest rate instrument used for inflation targeting is conducive to financial stability. Among countries with a fixed exchange rate regime, only in Bulgaria does transmission of the foreign interest rate impulse to domestic variables promote financial stability. Additionally, our results show that in Latvia and Lithuania adjustments to the monetary policy of the European Central Bank (ECB) are not in accordance with country-specific conditions. The paper contributes to a policy debate on the design of macro-prudential polices in the aftermath of the boom-bust cycle experienced by the Central and Eastern European countries in the second half of the last decade.

We estimate a vector autoregressive (VAR) model and find evidence of a smaller impact of monetary policy on loans made under commitment agreements than on loans not made under commitment. Our conclusion is that loan commitments effectively protect borrowers from quantity credit rationing and, thus, force monetary policy to work mainly through interest-rate channels.

AB  - Islamic bank in Indonesia exists side by side with its conventional counterpart within dual banking system, while the central bank aims to achieve price stability in the economy using conventional and Islamic monetary instruments within dual monetary system. This posits a very unique environment for Islamic bank. This research aims to examine the role of Islamic bank in monetary policy transmission mechanism using Granger Causality and Autoregressive Distributed Lag (ARDL). The balance sheet components of deposit and financing were hypothesized to function in monetary transmission process within bank financing channel. Granger causality revealed that Islamic interbank overnight rate granger causes Islamic deposit and financing. Islamic deposit and financing granger cause industrial production index. Industrial production index granger cause inflation, Islamic deposit, and Islamic interbank overnight rate. Islamic deposit and inflation granger cause Islamic interbank overnight rate. The ARDL results showed that there were cointegrating relationships in the output and inflation model. Long-term convergence could be reached to correct deviations in output and inflation by way of Islamic banks’ deposit and financing. However, short-term influence is contributed only by Islamic banks’ deposit to output. Islamic banks’ deposit does not contribute in the short-run to inflation. Islamic banks’ financing does not have short-term relationship with output and inflation. Hence, there is a declining effectiveness of Islamic banks’ financing contribution to the economy.

Romanian economy in order to identify the major shock in Romania for the last 10 years and to provide information concerning the evolution of the economy response to these shocks. That’s why, we have included in the analysis variables that emphasize the industrial production evolution, the exchange rate, the inflation, the real estate prices, the monetary aggregate M2 and the interest rate. The analysis
shows important conclusions. The exchange rate remains an
important mechanism that influences significantly the variables of the real economy, but the channel of the interest rate is being more and more consistent in the last years. The positive aspect that emerges from this study is related to the absence of output and price puzzle.

AB  - This paper, for the best of our knowledge, is the first attempt to assess the role of money in the Malaysian economy using wavelet techniques. To do so, a macroeconomic model-based policy rules has been formulated. In relation with the recurring financial crises, we analyse the relationship between the quantity of money, interest rate, inflation, exchange rate, index of industrial production and equity indices, in the case of Malaysia. In this analysis, UK economy aggregates are taken as benchmark. Therefore, the relationships between monetary policy variables and macroeconomic variables are evolving with time and have non-homogeneous trends across different time scales. Some strong correlations have been found in regard to Malaysian Monetary Policy using, major monetary aggregates; the quantity of Money, the interest rate and the exchange rate inducing some lead-lag interactions between those key variables. In addition, we analyse the effect of LIBOR on Malaysian interest rate (KLIBOR). We found that the KLIBOR is lagging behind the LIBOR in most of the time. In the end, some lessons will be drawn for the monetary policy in Malaysia, in terms of the high impact of the role of money and the expected implications regarding an effective Islamic monetary policy.

AU  - Candila, Vincenzo

T2  - Empirical Economics
AB  - Forecasting oil prices is not straightforward, such that it is convenient to build a confidence interval around the forecasted prices. To this end, the principal ingredient for obtaining a reliable crude oil confidence interval is its volatility. Moreover, accurate crude oil volatility estimation has fundamental implications in terms of risk management, asset pricing and portfolio handling. Generally, current studies consider volatility models based on lagged crude oil price realizations and, at most, one additional macroeconomic variable as crude oil determinant. This paper aims to fill this gap, jointly considering not only traditional crude oil driving forces, such as the aggregate demand and oil supply, but also the monetary policy rate. Thus, this work aims to contribute to the debate concerning the potential impact of (lagged) US monetary policy as well as the other crude oil future price (COFP) determinants on daily COFP volatility. By means of the recently proposed generalized autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity mixed data sampling model, different proxies of the US monetary policy alongside US industrial production (proxy of the US aggregate demand) and oil supply are included in the COFP volatility equation. Strong evidence that an expansionary (restrictive) variation in monetary policy anticipates a positive (negative) variation in COFP volatility is found. We also find that a negative (positive) variation of industrial production increases (decreases) COFP volatility. This means that volatility behaves counter-cyclically, according to the literature. Furthermore, the out-of-sample forecasting procedure shows that including these additional macroeconomic variables generally improves the forecasting performance.

AB  - This paper offers a unique perspective in the field of environmental economics and research by linking CO2 emissions (CO2e) and monetary policies. Through a newly-developed predictive model, the study estimated the impact of monetary policies on CO2e along with control variables, including income, remittances, urbanization, fossil fuels, and human capital in selected Asian economies for the period 1990–2014. Data were analyzed using the Pedroni and Kao co-integration tests, panel fully-modified (PFM-LS), and panel dynamic least squares (PD-LS) techniques for data analysis. Some of the main findings are as follows. First, the results showed a significant long-term positive relationship between expansionary monetary policy and CO2e. Second, the contractionary monetary policy serves an effective measure to mitigate CO2e. Third, improvements in human capital have a positive impact on reducing CO2e. Fourth, remittances and fossil fuels are also prime determinants of CO2e. Based on the present findings, the paper proposes important implications and a predictive tool for policymakers to design effective policies and strategies for reducing CO2e.

TI  - Is Monetary Policy Effective When Credit is Low?
AU  - Saizar, Ana Carolina
AU  - Chalk, Nigel
AB  - Monetary policy, at least in part, operates through both an interest rate and credit channel. The question arises, therefore, whether monetary policy is a less potent a device in affecting output and inflation in countries that have low levels of credit and where investment and consumption are not financed by borrowing in local currency. This paper employs a Panel Vector Auto Regression approach to examine the empirical evidence in a broad sample of emerging market countries. The data suggests that the effectiveness of changes in policy interest rates in influencing the path of inflation appear to be unrelated to the level of credit and that, instead, the willingness to allow exchange rate flexibility is a far more important determining factor.

AU  - Garretsen, Harry

T2  - De Economist
AB  - This paper presents empirical evidence of the existence of a bank lending channel in the Netherlands by analyzing the responses of different borrower groups to a contraction of monetary policy. It is found that corporate loans are depressed only after a lapse of over a year, whereas household loans decrease almost instantly due to an interest rate rise. However, since the latter reaction is not accompanied by a fall in consumer expenditure, the bank lending channel is probably not very important for the transmission of monetary policy in the Netherlands. It appears that households, as well as banks and firms, tend to buffer monetary policy shocks through adjustments in liquid financial instruments.

T2  - Applied Economics
AB  - The aim of this article is twofold: First, it examines the asymmetric effects of industrial production, money supply and RER on stock returns in Turkey by using the non-linear autoregressive distributed lag (NARDL) model over the periods of 1994:01–2017:05 and 2002:01–2017:05. Second, it tries to determine whether there is a change of these macroeconomic variables’ effects on stock returns after the 2001 financial crisis since after 2002 period represents a structural break from the past in terms of economic, political and macroeconomic policy approaches. The study finds that the effects of the changes in industrial production, money supply and RER on stock returns are asymmetric, and the asymmetries are larger after the 2002 subsample compared to the full sample period. The empirical results further suggest that tight monetary policies appear to retard the stock returns more than easy monetary policies that stimulate them.

TI  - Unconventional Monetary Policy and the Interest Rate Channel: Signalling and Portfolio Rebalancing
AU  - Lloyd, S. P.
AB  - In response to financial turmoil that began in 2007 and the effective lower bound for short-term interest rates that was reached in late-2008, the Federal Reserve adopted a raft of 'unconventional' monetary policies, notably: forward guidance and large-scale asset purchases. These policies transmit to the real economy, inter alia, via an interest rate channel, with two sub-channels: signalling and portfolio rebalancing. I apply the OIS-augmented decomposition of interest rates from Lloyd (2017a) to identify these two sub-channels. I demonstrate that US unconventional monetary policy announcements between November 2008 and April 2013 did exert significant signalling and portfolio balance effects on financial markets, reducing longer-term interest rates. Signalling effects were particularly powerful at horizons in excess of two years. As a result of these declines, unconventional monetary policy aided real economic outcomes. I show that the signalling channel exerted a more powerful influence on US industrial production and consumer prices than portfolio rebalancing. In terms of long-term bond yield and industrial production effects, the signalling channel is associated with around two-thirds to three-quarters of the total effects attributed to the two channels.

The Qual VAR uncovers the Federal Reserve's latent, unobservable propensity for QE and generates impulse responses for the emerging market REIT returns. The results show that QE has (strong) positively significant, but short-lived, effects on the returns of emerging market REITs.

TI  - Monetary policy transmission in the CEECs: a comprehensive analysis
AU  - Héricourt, Jérôme
T2  - Cahiers de la Maison des Sciences Economiques
AB  - This paper aims at providing better supported results regarding monetary policy transmission in Central and Eastern European countries (CEECs). In the general frame of VAR models, our study differs from previous research in two main respects. Firstly, we provide estimations which do not rely on the hypothesis of cointegration usually exploited in the related literature, but economically meaningless over less than ten years spans and statistically very fragile. Secondly, we present another set of results, relying on real GDP monthly data that have been rebuilt using the Chow and Lin (1971) method; this allows for an alternative to the traditional industrial production data, a partial and highly unstable proxy variable for output. These original methodological insights lead to results emphasizing the general prevalence of exchange rate and domestic credit channels for monetary policy transmission across the studied countries, despite some persistent national specificities. The empirical evidence also incites to be reasonably optimistic regarding the relevancy of a close integration of these countries into euro area.

AB  - After decades of strong economic growth, industrialization and rising living standards, China has become a dominant player in commodity markets. This study attempts to shed light on the role of China in global commodity price dynamics. The empirical analysis applies (Toda and Yamamoto, 1995, J Econom, 66, 225–250) type Granger causality tests and Generalized Impulse Response Functions (GIRF) to examine causal linkages and short-run dynamics between global commodity prices, economic activity, and monetary policy of China from 1998 to 2012. Our results provide evidence that economic activity is Granger causing both energy and industrial metals prices. As for the GIRF analysis, our findings suggest that energy and industrial metals prices respond positively to an increase in the economic activity and that agricultural as well as energy commodity prices overshoot after a drop in the real interest rate of China. We further find evidence that industrial metals prices tend to be higher when China׳s exchange rate system is relaxed.

AB  - One of the most difficult problems in economic policy-making is learning to read the content of current policy. Each of us has probably looked at the sharp peaks or troughs in a time series ot interest rates, the growth rate of money, the index of industrial production or some other measure and wondered why we had so much difficulty interpreting the changes at the time they occurred. Errors of judgment that become apparent with hindsight result frequently from a failure to interpret correctly changes that have already occurred or that are likely to occur because of policy actions already taken. Unaware of the future effect of current or previous actions, policy makers delay action too long, change too abruptly or too much.

We also investigate if all the predictive ability of the spread is due to the monetary policy. The results suggest that the yield spread contains relevant information, and this predictive power varies across time patterns. Inasmuch, the results indicate that the predictive power of the spread is not totally explained by monetary policy.

AB  - This study investigates the asymmetric effects of monetary policy shocks on the macroeconomic variables of exchange rate, output and inflation for an emerging economy ‒ Turkey ‒ by using monthly data between 1990 and 2014. We employ the innovative nonlinear vector autoregressive model of Kilian and Vigfusson (2011), which allows us to observe the effect of different stances (tight or loose) and different sizes (small or large) of monetary policy actions. Our empirical evidence reveals that tight monetary policy, which, in this case, is captured with a positive shock to interest rate, decreases exchange rate, output and prices, as economic theory suggests. Loose monetary policy, which is captured with a negative shock to interest rate, has the opposite effect on these variables. However, the effects of loose monetary policy are weaker than the effects of tight monetary policy because loose monetary policy shocks are less effective than tight monetary policy shocks. Moreover, as the magnitude of a shock increases, the difference between the effects of tight and loose monetary policy policies also increases.

Small-scale vector autoregressions (VARs), however, often find sluggish and insignificant impact effects. Using the same high-frequency instrument to identify monetary policy shocks, we show that a large-scale dynamic factor model finds overall stronger and quicker asset price reactions compared to a benchmark VAR, both on euro area and US data. Our results suggest that incorporating a sufficiently large information set is crucial to estimate monetary policy effects.

AB  - The paper is a narrative on monetary policy and the banking sector during the two recent euro area recessions. It shows that while in the two episodes of recession and financial stress the ECB acted aggressively providing liquidity to banks, the second recession, unlike the first, has been characterized by an abnormal decline of loans with respect to both real economic activity and the monetary aggregates. It conjectures that this fact is explained by the postponement of the adjustment in the banking sector. It shows that euro area banks, over the 2008–2012 period, did not change neither the capital to asset ratio nor the size of their balance sheet relative to GDP keeping them at the pre-crisis level. The paper also describes other aspects of banks’ balance sheet adjustment during the two crises pointing to a progressive dismantling of financial integration involving the inter-bank market since the first crisis and the market for government bonds since the second.

AB  - The Reserve Bank of India has formally adopted the "multiple indicator approach" in the conduct of monetary policy since April 1998. During this period, sole reliance on traditional indicators of monetary aggregates or policy rates is not adequate to reflect the stance of monetary policy. This paper develops a monetary policy index by synthesising the extracted signals from the policy documents and quantitative information embedded in key indicators. The MPI SO constructed was used to assess the impact of monetary policy on macroeconomic variables such as interest rates, bank credit, inflation, and output growth during the post-reform period. It was observed that while monetary policy has an instant influence on interest rates, the impact on inflation and output was realised with a lag of around 6 to 18 months.

It is assumed that monetary policy is a single dimensioned unobserved variable that links changes in a set of ‘causal’ variables representing economic goals and changes in money market ‘indicator’ variables. Several issues are examined pertaining to the weights attached to the causal variables including: the lag structure, changes over time, and asymmetric effects of positive and negative changes. As a by product of the model, the paper presents an estimated index of monetary policy for the years 1955–1975.
