AB  - This paper estimates a forward-looking monetary policy reaction function of the Central Bank of the Republic of Turkey by considering the period from 1990:01 to 2000:10. When the spread between the interbank rate and depreciation rate of the local currency is taken as a policy tool, the empirical evidence suggests that the Turkish Central Bank responds to its foreign exchange reserves, output and M2 growth not the forward, current or lagged inflation.

TI  - Monetary Policy Channels and Industrial Production in Pakistan: Evidences based on ARDL Approach | Journal of Accounting and Finance in Emerging Economies
AB  - Monetary policy is a significant component of economic management, with which we can control higher inflation, boost the economic growth and stabilize the other macroeconomic activities. This study investigates the channels of monetary policy affecting the industrial production using monthly data of Pakistan. In this regard, we have applied Bound test for co-integration to investigate the dynamic behaviour of the variables. Our results indicate that the consumer prices, money supply and money market rates are negatively effective for industrial production in the short-run. On the other hand, exchange rate has positive effect in short-run. The results also indicate that there is statistically significant and positive relationship between industrial output and money supply in the long-run, too. The adjustment mechanism suggests stability in the system and is statistically significant. Our results imply that the authorities should use expansionary monetary stance through money supply channel to boost the industrial sector.

AB  - The importance of financial markets and international capital flows has increased greatly since the 1990s. How does this affect the effectiveness of monetary policy? We analyse the transmission of monetary policy in two important financial centres, the United States and the United Kingdom. Studying the responses of mortgage and corporate spreads, we find evidence in favour of an important financial channel in both countries. Our identification strategy allows us to study the effect of movements in the policy instruments and forward guidance, broadly defined. We also analyse international financial spillovers, which we find to be asymmetric. (JEL: E32, E43, E44, G01)

AU  - Holmes, Mark J

AB  - This study investigates whether or not UK industrial production is characterised by a nonlinear response to monetary shocks. Our methodology is based on logistic smooth transition vector autoregression modelling where we employ monthly data for the period January 1960 to August 1999. We find evidence of small, though nonetheless significant nonlinearities. Furthermore, we find support for a range of New Keynesian arguments insofar as greater price flexibility, and therefore less real adjustment, occurs against a background of high inflation. In addition, the potency of monetary shocks can depend on the position of the UK economy in the business cycle.

T2  - Journal of Forecasting
AB  - In an uncertain world, decisions by market participants are based on expectations. Therefore, sentiment indicators reflecting expectations have a proven track record at predicting economic variables. However, survey respondents largely perceive the world through media reports. Here, we want to make use of that. We employ a rich dataset provided by Media Tenor International, based on sentiment analysis of opinion-leading media in Germany from 2001 to 2014, transformed into several monthly indices. German industrial production is predicted in a real-time out-of-sample forecasting experiment and media indices are compared to a huge set of alternative indicators. Media data turn out to be valuable for 10- to 12-month horizon forecasts, which is in line with the lag between monetary policy announcements and their effect on industrial production. This holds in the period during and after the Great Recession when many models fail. Copyright © 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AU  - Kirchner, Stephen
T2  - Australian Economic Review
AB  - This article examines the response of consumer and business confidence to five measures of change in Australian monetary policy. Actual, expected and surprise increases in the official cash rate target and related interest rates are shown to negatively impact consumer sentiment. Business confidence is less affected by increases in the cash rate target, but is negatively affected by an increase in the 90-day bank accepted bill rate. Tests for model stability and asymmetries in the response of sentiment to increases and decreases in interest rates otherwise find only limited evidence for monetary policy having a perverse signalling effect on sentiment.

The parameters are allowed to follow a random walk process and estimated using the Markov chain Monte Carlo method. The empirical result reveals the time-varying structure of the Japanese economy and monetary policy during the period from 1981 to 2008. The marginal likelihoods of the TVP–VAR model and other fixed parameter VAR models are estimated for model comparison. The estimated marginal likelihoods indicate that the TVP–VAR model best fits the Japanese economic data.

T2  - International Economic Journal
AB  - We examine in this paper the importance of banks’ behavior in the transmission of the monetary policy to the real economy. Monthly data from eight economies in transition that recently became members of the European Union and the techniques of cointegration and Error Correction models are used, in order to investigate the relationship between intermediation margin spread (IMS, official lending rate minus deposit rate) and industrial production. Given the low development of corporate bond market and the dependence of non-financial agents on banking credits, we find that in many countries the IMS is an important leading indicator of industrial production. However, in countries characterized by credit access constraints (Estonia and Latvia) evidence for the traditional money channel is found. Evidence for both money and credit channels is found in Poland and Hungary. These results imply that a common monetary policy implemented by the European Central Bank may be transmitted in different ways across the new members of the enlarged European Union with different effects on real output in each country.

T2  - Economy and Forecasting
AB  - The paper highlights the important problem of the impact of monetary policy on macroeconomic indicators in Ukraine and analyzes the global experience of the implementation of monetary policy to achieve stable projections of economic growth. The authors review the basic opinions of researchers studying monetary policy and its impact on the equilibrium between income and balance of payments. A comparative analysis was made for the growth rates of money supply and monetization for industrial countries and transitional economies. The authors carry out an empirical estimation to assess the dependence of industrial production, total exports and technological exports on monetary factor and exchange rate using two-stage least squares model (2SLS) and vector autoregression with error correction (VECM). The main research findings include: devaluation of the hryvnia does not serve as a factor of exports stimulation, which largely depends on energy imports; currency devaluation restricts the exports of industrial production. The increase in monetization level of the economy in the short-term period improves the dynamics of industrial output, but, in the long term period, the effect is opposite. Depreciation of national currency negatively impacts the technological exports. On the whole, the authors identify a restrictive impact of the expansion of monetary policy on industrial output, primary exports and technological exports.

AB  - We explore the role of interest rates in monetary policy transmission in China in the context of its multiple instrument setting. In doing so, we construct a new series of monetary policy surprises using information from high frequency Chinese financial market data around major monetary policy announcements. Our event analysis shows that monetary policy surprises have persistent effects on interest rates. We then use these surprise measures as external instruments to identify monetary policy shocks in an SVAR. We find that a contractionary monetary policy surprise increases interest rates and significantly reduces inflation and economic activity. Our findings provide further support to recent studies suggesting that monetary policy transmission in China has become increasingly similar to that in advanced economies.

AU  - Sauer, Stephan

T2  - German Economic Review
AB  - Over the last decade, the simple instrument policy rule developed by Taylor has become a popular tool for evaluating the monetary policy of central banks. As an extensive empirical analysis of the European Central Bank’s (ECB) past behaviour still seems to be in its infancy, we estimate several instrument policy reaction functions for the ECB to shed some light on actual monetary policy in the euro area under the presidency of Wim Duisenberg and answer questions like whether the ECB has actually followed a stabilizing or a destabilizing rule so far. Looking at contemporaneous Taylor rules, the evidence presented suggests that the ECB is accommodating changes in inflation and hence follows a destabilizing policy. However, this impression seems to be largely due to the lack of a forward-looking perspective in such specifications. Either assuming rational expectations and using a forward-looking specification, or using expectations as derived from surveys result in Taylor rules that do imply a stabilizing role of the ECB. The use of real-time industrial production data does not seem to play such a significant role as in the case of the United States.

T2  - Financial Innovation
AB  - The study empirically assesses how macroprudential policy interacts with systemic risk, industrial production, and monetary intervention on a global level from January 2006 to December 2018. We adopt the aggregate proxies of these variables, capturing their global effects, and use a novel econometric technique, namely, smooth local projections. The study finds that global macroprudential policy leads the monetary policy, exhibiting a countercyclical pattern concerning industrial production. The latter has an inverse bidirectional linkage with systemic risk. Thus, an ex-ante tight macroprudential policy can indirectly mitigate global systemic risk through its pro-growth effect on industrial production, although no convincing evidence exists for the direct impact of a macroprudential intervention on systemic risk. The study results endure several extensions and a robustness check, which builds on alternative measures of global systemic stress and real economic activity, thereby legitimizing the increased importance attached to the macroprudential policy since the 2007–2009 global financial crisis.

AB  - The monetary easing of the past few years by the world’s major central banks through conventional and unconventional policies coincided with the longest and broadest commodity price boom since the Second World War. And not surprisingly, the impending normalization of monetary conditions has created expectations of a likely reversal in commodity price trends. Based on a reduced form, price-determination model which accounts for all quantifiable sectoral and macroeconomic fundamentals, this note finds that the effect of short-term interest rates on metal prices is mixed and modest. But, changes in longer term rates have a positive and highly significant impact. The note also concludes that metal prices respond (in that order) to industrial production, input prices, US dollar movements and physical stocks of metals.

T2  - Japan and the World Economy
AB  - The effects of monetary policy on the aggregate economy is an important issue that has been addressed mainly in the time domain, and relatively little is known about how monetary policy affects the macroeconomy in the time-frequency space. With a continuous wavelet multiple coherency and partial coherency approach, this paper contributes to the literature by characterizing the macroeconomic effects of monetary policy across frequencies and over time using a monthly dataset from Japan, which is in the vanguard in the practice of unconventional monetary policy. The empirical results show that: First, interest rate changes could be largely captured by inflation fluctuations across frequencies before 1999 but only at low frequencies after 1999. Second, movements of M1 could well reflect the variations of industrial production at the scale of 2–4 years before 1999, but this relationship was reversed at the same scale after 1999. Third, changes in M2 could roughly mirror the fluctuations of inflation at the scale of 3–4 years between 1966 and 1969, and this relationship was reversed at the scale of 1–3 years between 2003 and 2007. This study indicates that in Japan conventional and unconventional monetary policy generate heterogeneous effects on the aggregate economy and the level of heterogeneity partially depends on the chosen instrument.

AB  - This article assesses the effect of tight monetary policy on economic performance under different levels of capital flows. Empirical evidence from Turkey between 1990 and 2013 suggests that tight monetary policy measured with a positive innovation on interest rate appreciates the Turkish Lira and decreases output and prices. However, the effectiveness of monetary policy decreases for interest rate and increases for exchange rate and prices if capital flows are high. Specifically, interest rate, local currency value of foreign currency and prices will be lower for higher levels of capital flows. However, the relative effectiveness of monetary policy on output is virtually unchanged.

AB  - Using the vector autoregressive methodology, we present estimates of monetary transmission for five new EU member countries in Central and Eastern Europe with more or less flexible exchange rates. We select sample periods to estimate over the longest possible period that can be considered as a single monetary policy regime. To identify the vector autoregression (VAR), structural restrictions and the widely used Cholesky ordering are employed. We conclude that the structural VAR yields much better results. Fewer countries suffer from a price puzzle (i.e., an increase in prices following a monetary contraction). Our results also indicate that there are substantial differences in monetary transmission across the countries in our sample.

T2  - Folia Oeconomica Stetinensia
AB  - AbstractThis paper examines whether the five BRICS countries share similar business cycles and determines the probability of any of the countries moving from a contractionary regime to an expansionary regime. The study further examines the extent to which changes in monetary policy affect industrial output in expansions relative to contractions. Employing the Peersman and Smets (2001) Markov-Switching Model (MSM) and monthly data from 1994.01–2013.12, the study reveals that the five BRICS countries have similar business cycles. The results further demonstrate that the BRICS countries’ business cycles are characterized by two distinct growth rate phases: a contractionary regime and an expansionary regime. It can also be observed that the area-wide monetary policy has significantly large effects on industrial output in recessions as well as in booms. It has also been established that there is a high probability of moving from state one (recession) to state two (expansion) and that on average, the probabilities of staying in state 2 (expansion) are high for each of the five countries. It is, therefore, recommended that the BRICS countries should sustain uniform policy consistency (monetary policy), especially as they formulate and implement economic policies to stimulate industrial output.

AB  - We identify cyclical turning points for 74 U.S. manufacturing industries and uncover new empirical regularities: (a) industries tend to comove between expansion and contraction phases over the business cycle; (b) clusters of industry turning points are highly asymmetric between peaks and troughs: troughs are much more concentrated and sharper than peaks; (c) the temporal pattern of phase shifts across industries supports the spillovers through input-output linkages; and (d) macroeconomic shocks, such as unanticipated changes in monetary policy, government spending, oil prices, and financial conditions, are significant drivers of industrial phase shifts.

TI  - ANALYSIS OF THE MONETARY POLICY TRANSMISSION INTO CEEs COUNTRIES. A VAR APPROACH
AU  - Mercea, Patricia Amalia
T2  - REVISTA ECONOMIA CONTEMPORANĂ
AB  - Understanding how real economy adjust to the exchange rate fluctuations enables us to anticipate the effects on inflation, capital market, exports, as well as the monetary policy responses. This study examines the extent of the exchange rate pass-through to the real economy (consumer price index, industrial production, capital market, exports, interest rate) in Bulgaria, Czech Republic, Poland, Romania, and Hungary over the 2008M01-2019M08 period. A Vector Autoregressive analysis using impulse-response functions supported the results for the short term and found a lower degree of pass-through for the exchange rate shocks for all CEE countries. The results of its econometric analysis show that the degree of the exchange rate pass-through is incomplete. The conclusion is that exchange rate remains an important instrument for monetary policy in these economies.

AU  - Faust, Jon

AB  - We estimate a monetary policy reaction function for the  Bundesbank and use it as a benchmark to assess the monetary  policy of the ECB since the launch of the euro in January 1999. We find that euro interest rates are low relative to this  benchmark.  We consider several possible reasons for this,  including the divergence between core and headline inflation,  inflation having turned out to be higher than could have been  foreseen by the ECB and the possibility that the ECB is  focussing only on macroeconomic conditions in a subset of  member countries.  We argue that these potential explanations  cannot account for the difference between recent interest rates  and our estimated Bundesbank benchmark. Our results suggest that  the reaction function of the ECB features a high weight on the  output gap relative to the weight on inflation, compared to the  Bundesbank.

Since the introduction of the ECB, declining absolute abnormal returns have been compatible with the theory that stock markets learn from ECB monetary policy. In particular, Eurozone financial markets extract information from the ECB announcements and consider this information before making investment decisions. Furthermore, the predictability of ECB monetary policy has been increasing over time.

AB  - This paper examines the problem of testing the RESN hypothesis from the perspective of a developing economy where deviation of the level of output from its natural rate is assumed to be affected by the unexpected monetary change only. In this context, we have developed three different methods to estimate the anticipated and unanticipated money change. The empirical findings are in conflict with the RESN hypothesis that only unanticipated money growth matters for real economic activity and, hence, the paper provides opposing evidence for the usefulness of this approach for the macroeconomic policies in developing economies.

AU  - Herve, Drama Bedi Guy
T2  - Applied Economics and Finance
AB  - This paper examines and foresees the impacts of monetary policy on economic growth by studying the case of Cote d¡¯Ivoire through the SVAR model. More specifically, the second target is to analyze which policy is reliable for the explanation of real activities fluctuation in Cote d¡¯Ivoire. Thus, we will use eight structural variable SVAR tools by using monthly time data series running from 1990:1 to 2014:12. This SVAR model is also carried out to generate impulse response function that raises the impact of economic policy shocks on growth in Cote d¡¯Ivoire. In addition, from the estimated SVAR equation, we passed through the estimated structural imposition of restrictions and we generated the forecast error variance decomposition analyses that help us make prediction. Our empirical results demonstrate that innovations in monetary aggregate impact in real activities and prices although very low. This implies that monetary policy shocks are not the main determinant of business cycle movements in Cote d¡¯Ivoire. Second, the empirical analysis also shows that the real interest rate and money aggregate significantly respond to variations in the industrial production index while other variables respond insignificantly. This means that the industrial sector in Cote d¡¯Ivoire is constrained by the higher credit cost in their production process. Finally, since global oil price shock captured real activities and impacted negatively output growth, we recommend a gradual diversification of the domestic economy and optimal fiscal policy that could be reliable because it plays a dominant role.

AB  - The recent financial crisis has been characterized by unprecedented monetary policy interventions of central banks with the intention to stabilize financial markets and the real economy. This paper sheds light on the actual impact of monetary policy on stock liquidity and thereby addresses its role as a determinant of commonality in liquidity. Our results suggest that an expansionary monetary policy of the European Central Bank leads to an increase of aggregate stock market liquidity in the German, French and Italian markets. Furthermore, the effect of monetary policy is significantly stronger for smaller stocks, suggesting a non-linear impact of monetary policy on stock liquidity.

T2  - Journal of Public Affairs
AB  - Over the years, there has been an increasing debate over the role of the Central Bank in targeting the policy objectives and the extent to which the targets can anchor the expectations. The present study seeks to identify the linkage between monetary policy and financial stability in India. The study, based on quarterly data from January 2001 to July 2018, finds that the financial sector allied variables (BSE SENSEX index, Exchange Rate and Index of Industrial Production) have shown significant response to shocks in the policy rate, that is, reverse repo rate, except for exchange rate variable that was taken as a proxy for external sector stability. Also in the short-run, when a shock is imparted to the policy rate, the response of the exchange rate is insignificant. Other than that, the corporate sector along with real output growth and banking sector variables induces a significant change in policy rate when a shock is introduced. With variables responding in the ideal direction to shock in the policy rate, it is inferred that the movement is in line with what ideally should hold over time. This leads us to conclude that the monetary policy safeguards financial stability in India.

AB  - Purpose The purpose of this paper is to evaluate and analyze impacts of the monetary policy (MP) – money aggregate and interest rate – on the exchange rate in Vietnam. Design/methodology/approach The study uses data over the period of 2008–2018 and applies the vector autoregression model, namely recursive restriction and sign restriction approaches. Findings The main empirical findings are as follows: a contraction of the money aggregate significantly leads to the real effective exchange rate (REER) depreciating and then appreciating; a tightening of the interest rate immediately causes the REER appreciating and then depreciating; and both the money aggregate and the interest rate strongly determine fluctuations of the REER. Originality/value The quantitative results imply that the MP affects the REER considerably.

To simultaneously estimate the model parameters and unobserved factors, we rely on Bayesian estimation and inference. Policy shocks are identified using high-frequency surprises around policy announcements as an external instrument. Impulse response functions reveal differences in regional housing price responses, which in some cases are substantial. The heterogeneity in policy responses is found to be significantly related to local regulatory environments and housing supply elasticities. Moreover, housing prices responses tend to be similar within states and adjacent regions in neighboring states.

TI  - The Effects of Trade Restrictions and Monetary Policy during The Great Depression
AU  - Hansen, Eric
AU  - Fregert, Klas
AB  - Many factors are considered when analysing how countries managed to recover from
the Great Depression. Leaving the gold standard and the increased protectionism are considered
important variables regarding the length and depth of countries recessions. This work aims to
estimate which variables allowed for or hindered the world’s economies to combat the
economic turmoil during the 1930s. In this context, the high rates of unemployment is closely
related to the decline in industrial production.
To measure how the variables depreciation and tariff rates affected the industrial
production, several multivariate regressions were performed. Data from relevant countries
between 1929 and 1938, along with a dummy variable for observations pegged to gold, was
used in the data analysis. The results showed that the depreciation of a country’s currency in
relation to gold had a significant positive effect on industrial production. An individual
country’s tariff rates showed to have no statistically significant effect, rather the international
average tariff rate proved to have a strong negative effect on countries industrial production.
Although the effects of depreciation and the international average tariff rate varied depending
on how the regressions were specified, both variables proved to have a significant effect on
industrial production.
These results suggests that an individual country could not increase their industrial
production by pursuing a policy of limited trade restrictions. Rather, it was the collectively high
tariff rates that affected industrial production. Instead, the more countries that left the gold
standard and decreased trade restriction, the more countries could benefit from the positive
effects of depreciation and lower average tariffs, thereby recovering industrial production and
in the extension, unemployment.

AB  - Macroeconomists disagree concerning whether monetary policy affects real variables. Recently, Bernanke and Blinder have presented evidence that the federal funds rate is a good indicator of monetary policy and that it forecasts real variables well. Here we use a nonlinear seemingly unrelated regression technique to demonstrate that the funds rate is a priced factor in the arbitrage pricing model and that unexpected increases (decreases) in the funds rate lower (raise) stock prices. This provides evidence from a different data set using a different methodology corroborating Bernanke and Blinder's finding that monetary policy working through the funds rate affects real activity.

TI  - Macroeconomic effects of unconventional monetary policy in the United States
AU  - Sümbül, Münip Kutay
AB  - This thesis examines the macroeconomic effects of unconventional policy with
smooth local projections in the United States. Unconventional monetary policy
is identified using Swanson (2021)’s methodology. I find that the most effective
policy tool is the target factor for unemployment and industrial production;
however, its effect is not persistent as other tools. For instance, large scale asset
purchases (LSAP) induce a significant and persistent impact on industrial production
and forward guidance for unemployment. LSAP is the most successful
instrument for inflation in the short run, but inflation responds more persistently
to forward guidance. Therefore, a mix in which all three tools are used
to manage a successful monetary policy can solve short-term and long-term
problems for each macroeconomic variable. The findings here are consistent
with the previous literature, and they are even supportive.

AB  - This paper analyses the European central bank (ECB) monetary policy over the period 1999–2006, with a special emphasis on the recent years. The first part of the paper underlines the declared goals, decision variables and procedures, as can be inferred from various speeches of Jean-Claude Trichet, the President of the ECB. These statements are then weighted against the data, mainly through estimates of possible ECB interest rate rules. While in many respects the bank has performed reasonably well, several issues may be raised, mainly because the inflation objective has not been reached during the last period and monetary developments are not in line with economic stability. Policy recommendations follow, built on a renewed monetarist tradition: the reduction of the weight of real activity in the conduct of monetary policy, while further emphasising money via a money growth intermediate target.

Our paper confirms the efficacy of the Kim and Roubini (J Monet Econ 45(3):561–586, 2000) contemporaneous restriction, customized for the Indian economy, especially when compared with recursive structure, which is damaged by the price puzzle and the exchange rate puzzle. The importance of incorporating correctly measured money into the exchange rate model is illustrated, when we compare models with no-money, simple-sum monetary measures, and Divisia monetary measures. Our results are confirmed in terms of impulse response, variance decomposition analysis, and out-of-sample forecasting. In addition, we do a flip-flop variance decomposition analysis, finding two important phenomena in the Indian economy: (i) the existence of a weak link between the nominal-policy variable and real-economic activity, and (ii) the use of inflation-targeting as a primary goal of the Indian monetary authority. These two main results are robust, holding across different time period, dissimilar monetary aggregates, and diverse exogenous model designs.

AB  - Early in 1932 the Federal Reserve System made a serious attempt to reverse the “Great Contraction” throught expansionary open market operations, but abandoned it a few months later. In this paper we offer an interpretation of the episode that throws new light on the Fed's behavior during the Depression. Key are the attitude of private bankers, Britain's abandonment of the gold standard, and the brief open market campaign. To protect bank profits the Fed abandoned the program which set the stage for the complete financial collapse of the United States in early 1933.

TI  - Monetary Policy and Government Debt
AU  - Davis, UC
AB  - We study how the level of government debt affects the effectiveness of monetary policy, i.e., the elasticity of economic aggregates to interest rate changes. We build a New Keynesian model where ﬁscal policy is non-Ricardian and government debt is risk-free. Wealth effects generated by government bonds weaken the transmission of changes in the policy rate to output. Using data on private ownership of public debt for the U.S., we ﬁnd that when government debt is one standard deviation above its mean, the response of industrial production and unemployment to a monetary shock is reduced by 0.5pp and 0.075pp, respectively, out to a three-year horizon.

TI  - Monetary Policy Effectiveness in China : Evidence from a Structural VAR Model
AU  - Hao, Li

T2  - 유라시아연구
AB  - This study aims to analyze the effectiveness of monetary policy. It is important to study the influence channel of monetary policies on the real economy. Based on the structural VAR model, this study uses the monthly data from the Chinese financial sector and actual macroeconomic variables from January 2001 to December 2020 to analyze the influence channel of monetary policy and its impact on the real economy in order to find out about the effectiveness of monetary policy. Focusing on before and after the global financial crisis, this study elaborates on the transmission effects of monetary policy before and after the global financial crisis. The results are as follows. In terms of the impact of rising interest rates, before and after the global financial crisis, industrial production continued to be negatively affected for a long time and consumer prices continued to increase during this period leading to price difficulties. In addition, the money supply and the RMB exchange rate decreased. Due to the shock of rising interest rates, stock indexes have fallen as predicted according to the economic theories. Moreover, because of the shock of rising interest rate, higher money supply, industrial production situation was unexpected before and after the global financial crisis, which led to a positive effect on consumer prices in the short-term. The change of RMB exchange rate was not obvious statistically, but there was a negative effect. During this period, stock indexes was the opposite of expectation. The impact of some macroeconomic variables on monetary policy can be seen as different from predictions based on economic theories and it doesn’t have much statistical significance, indicating the lack of effectiveness and transmission effect of monetary policy. The influence channel and effects of monetary policies are similar to the black box. Inevitably there will be changes in the financial markets and the real economy according to the specific conditions. It also means the influence channel and effects of monetary policy don’t play a vital role. It takes a long time for monetary policies to affect the real economy. Therefore, to maximize the effect of monetary policies, it is essential to determine the current economic situation and implement the policies. Furthermore, it is vital to actively improve the financial market system. Hence, it will be possible to enhance the efficiency of financial resource allocation and enable the financial market to do its roles in structural adjustment and risk prevention.

TI  - Impact of Monetary Policy on Post Crashed Stock Market Performance: Evidence from Dhaka Stock Exchange
AU  - Mukit, Dewan Muktadir Al
AU  - Shafiullah, A Z M
AB  - This paper investigates the impact of monetary policy variables on the performance of recent post crashed stock market of Bangladesh using monthly data from 2011. As a dependent variable Dhaka Stock Exchange (DSE) General Index (DGEN) has been used as a proxy for stock market performance and three independent variables have been used namely money supply, repo rate and inflation rate as proxies for monetary variables. The study used econometric techniques of measuring the functional relationship between monetary variables and market index using the concept of Unit root test and Cointegration technique. Causal relationships have been investigated using Granger causality test. The coefficients of all the explanatory variables are found statistically significant. By employing Cointegration technique it is observed that in the volatile stock market of Bangladesh, a one percent increase in inflation, in money supply and in repo rate contributes 2.61and 12.98 percent decrease and 6.08 percent increase in the market index respectively. Finally, Granger causality analysis suggests the existence of unidirectional causality from inflation to DGEN index and money supply to DGEN index.

TI  - Analysis of the Role of Exchange Rate Volatility in Monetary Policy Conduction in OECD Countries: Empirical Evidence from Panel-VAR Models
AU  - Ozcelebi, Oguzhan
AB  - In this study, panel vector autoregression (PVAR) models are employed to examine the relationships between industrial production growth rate, consumer price inflation, short-term interest rates, stock returns and exchange rate volatility. More specifically, I explored the consequences of the dynamics detected by the models on monetary policy implementation for 10 OECD countries. This study indicates that factors that may cause a rise in short-term interest rates with respect to the USA can lead to volatility in exchange rates and thus macroeconomic instability. It is also implied that sustaining macroeconomic growth and decreasing inflation can result in increased export performance, which in turn provides the amount of US dollars to curb volatility in US dollar quotations. Accordingly, this study reveals that high importance should be given to both monetary and non-monetary factors in the open-economy framework to detect the possible impacts on trade and capital flows by dynamic stochastic general equilibrium (DSGE) models. Due to their exchange rate risk of economic agents, I also suggest that the economic policy makers of these countries had better create a theoretical framework including financial frictions, economic agents’ preferences and different shocks to smooth the variations in exchange rates and minimise the negative outcomes of Brexit.

TI  - Unconventional Monetary Policy Shocks and the Spillovers to Emerging Markets
AU  - Research, Institute for Monetary and Financial
AU  - Kong, Hong
AB  - This working paper was written by Peter Tillmann (Justus-Liebig-University Gießen).Unconventional monetary policy such as Quantitative Easing (QE) is often considered to have considerable spillover effects on emerging market economies (EME). Aims at quantifying these effects so far mostly use high-frequency data around announcement dates, panels or VAR models. This paper proposes an alternative way to estimate the effects of QE on emerging markets that allows us to include macroeconomic, i.e. low-frequency, data together with announcement dates. A Qual VAR is estimated that integrates binary information of QE announcements with an otherwise standard VAR including US and emerging market variables. The model uncovers the Fed's latent, unobservable propensity for QE and generates impulse responses for EME variables to QE shocks. The results suggest that QE has strong effects on EME's financial conditions and plays a large role in explaining capital inflows, equity prices and exchange rates.

AB  - We challenge the assumption in the literature of constant housing supply elasticities across housing expansions. Using a time-varying parameter (TVP)-VAR model on monthly US data since the early 1990s, we find that the response of housing supply to an expansionary monetary policy shock relative to the response of house prices has declined substantially since the Great Financial Crisis (GFC). Our findings are consistent with research suggesting that land-use regulation has tightened. Absent major reversions in regulation, our results point to a post-COVID-19 housing recovery characterised by a sluggish response of housebuilding to demand, but a relatively stronger response of house prices.

AB  - This paper attempts to investigate the effect of fiscal and monetary policy on Indonesian Stock price as well as main sectors stock price such as agricultural, mining, manufacture, and financial sector indexes. We consider the world oil price as a foreign variable that will influence domestic economy as in regular small open economy model. In this paper, we employ the Monte Carlo algorithm to Near-SVAR models (If some of the VAR equations have regressors not included in the others). We find that there is a positive stock price response to monetary policy shock both aggregated and sectoral stock price. In term of interaction between fiscal policy shock and stock market, we find that all sectors respond negative relationship. From this empirical finding, fiscal policy crowd out private sector activity in market, thus, its effect will be impotent in economy. We also provide the evidence that not only both policies are able to influence the stock price individually, but also the interaction between monetary and fiscal policy is important in explaining stock market performance.

TI  - Is there a carry trade channel of monetary policy in emerging countries?
AU  - Kisgergely, Kornél
AB  - This paper empirically tests whether monetary policy can have a perverse effect on aggregate demand in emerging economies, because of short-term speculative inflows. For this purpose, a bayesian VAR is estimated on a panel of six major emerging countries. Monetary and risk shocks are identified by imposing only very mild restrictions. It is found that a positive interest rate shock results in a persistent decline in production and inflation. The net foreign asset position even improves in most of the countries. Thus no large net inflows are observed and there is no sign of a perverse effect on aggregate demand. More interestingly, central banks loosen interest rate policy significantly and persistently in the face of a capital inflow shock, possibly to dampen the immediate disinflationary effect of the appreciation and/or to protect balance sheets from exchange rate volatility. In some specifications this results in overheating (positive industrial production gap and inflation) in the medium-term. Thus central banks might amplify the effect of risk premium shocks by cutting interest rates - rather than raising them - when capital flows in.

AB  - In this paper, we investigate the interdependence between monetary policy and asset prices in ASEAN-5 countries. Within country-specific models and proxying asset prices by the composite stock market indices of these countries, we find strong interdependence between monetary policy and asset prices. We show that real stock prices decline as interest rates increase due to a contractionary monetary policy shock. Interest rates rise in response to an increase in real stock prices induced by a real stock price shock, although it does so a couple of months after the shock. We find the interdependence of monetary policy and asset prices to hold up within panel models. The delay in interest rate response to real stock price shocks originates from three of the ASEAN-5 countries, namely Indonesia, the Philippines, and Thailand.

To that end, the paper extends the structural vector autoregressive (SVAR) methodology with structural breaks. The findings show that a positive monetary policy shock, namely an increase in interest rates, results in a decrease in consumer prices and the exchange rate. The findings also exhibit that a positive shock in the exchange rate, namely the depreciation of the TRY against foreign currencies, increases interest rates and consumer prices. The implications of these findings in terms of monetary policy in Turkey are discussed in the paper.

AB  - This paper studies the effects of ECB conventional and unconventional monetary policies –including Covid-19– on the European Monetary Union (EMU) and spillovers to the European Economic Area (EEA), Canada, Japan, Switzerland, UK and US. ECB monetary policy shocks are identified as daily shifts in the entire yield curve around monetary policy announcements. By observing the responses of industrial production, inflation and exchange rates we have three main results. First, in the EMU, both conventional and unconventional policies move industrial production and inflation as theory predicts; yet, the effect in unconventional times crucially depends on the reaction of the whole yield curve. Second, spillovers of ECB policies to non-EMU countries are significant, especially for the EEA. Third, the uncovered interest parity condition holds both in conventional and unconventional times: a monetary policy easing generates an expected future appreciation. Interestingly, the exchange rate regime is not relevant.

T3  - Department of Economics Working Paper Series
AB  - As a consequence of asset purchases by the European Central Bank (ECB), longer-term yields in the euro area decline, and spreads between euro area long-term yields narrow. To assess spillovers of these recent financial developments, we use a Bayesian variant of the global vector autoregressive (BGVAR) model with stochastic volatility and propose a novel mixture of zero impact and sign restrictions that we impose on the cross-section of the data. Both shocks generate positive and significant spillovers to industrial production in Central, Eastern and Southeastern Europe (CESEE) and other non-euro area EU member states. These effects are transmitted via the financial channel (mainly through interest rates and equity prices) and outweigh costs of appreciation pressure on local currencies vis-á-vis the euro (trade channel). While these results represent general trends, we also find evidence for both cross-country heterogeneity of effects within the euro area and region-specific spillovers thereof.

TI  - Spillover Effects of Russian Monetary Policy Shocks on the Eurasian Economic Union
AU  - Abramov, Vladislav
AB  - Russian monetary policy could translate on the countries of Eurasian Economic Union (EAEU) through different channels. However, there is still a lack of evidence of the significance of so called spillover effects of Russian monetary policy. This work investigates the influence of Russian monetary policy shocks, proxied by shocks of MIACR, on the EAEU countries. For that purpose, firstly, monetary policy shocks were identified via FAVAR model for the Russian economy, estimated on the monthly data of more than 50 indicators. Further, separately for each country of the union VAR models with previously extracted MP shocks were estimated and both impulse response functions (IRF) and forecast error variance decomposition (FEVD) were analysed. The main result of the work is that effects of shocks in MIACR on industrial production and inflation are not statistically significant. At the same time, such shocks have statistically significant effect on money supply, nominal exchange rates and money market rates in some union’s countries. However, obtained effects are mostly small and heterogeneous.

T2  - International Journal of Business and Society
AB  - Malaysia imposed capital control and fixed exchange rate during 1999-2005 due to Asia financial crisis 1997/98. The capital control was liberalized and the pegged ringgit was lifted in July 2005. This study examines the dynamic relationship among macroeconomic stability and industrial performance in the post-capital control era with de-pegged regime. Macro variables such as industrial production (Y), exchange rate (RM/USD), monetary aggregates (M3) and interest rate (R) were being analyzed. The long- and short-run relationships were discovered among the variables at different signs and magnitudes. By VECM specification, the production function was bearing most of the short-run adjustments towards the long-run equilibrium but the adjustments were slow (> 6 years), in respond to shocks in the system. The impulse response function and variance decomposition analyses reveal that changes in macroeconomic variables have led to similar patterns of behavior with significant effects differing mainly in terms of shock adjustment. Dynamic causal effects were also being detected among the variables to justify the export led-growth strategy but the monetary effects were less prominent. In brief, monitoring the macro stability and foreign exchange shocks are essential in sustaining the industrial performance of Malaysia.

AB  - Lee (1994) finds evidence of market inefficiency using a bivariate model of monetary aggregates and stock prices; changes in monetary stock unidirectionally cause stock prices. We use the same test period and data as the Lee study, but estimate a multivariate model using variables suggested by the literature. We find (slight) evidence that stock prices cause changes in monetary stocks, but no evidence suggesting market inefficiency. Our results are robust for different testing procedures and provide further evidence of efficient financial markets.

Within this context, quarterly data of for the periods between 2002q1 and 2016q4 was taken into the consideration. Additionally, VAR model was used to reach the objective. According to the result of impulse response function, it was reached that producer price index, real exchange rate and policy rate are effective determinants. Additionally, banks balance sheet has important and positive influence on total credits but industrial production index is regarded as partially effective. While considering this result, it was also found that both bank balance and macroeconomic variables used in this study is the main determinants of bank total credit.

AB  - The paper investigates the effect of monetary policy variables on the performance of the stock market of Bangladesh using monthly data over the period of January, 2006 to July, 2012. The objective of the study is to consider the effectiveness and consequence of various monetary variables of monetary policy commenced by central bank on the stock market
performance of Bangladesh. As a dependent variable, DSE
General(DGEN) Index has been used as a proxy for stock market
performance and four independent variables-money supply, repo rate, inflation rate and three-month Treasury bill rate have been used as proxy for monetary variables. Employing Cointegration technique it is observed that in the long run, a one percent increase in inflation, in money supply, in T-bill rate and in repo rate contributes 1.69 %, 0.38 % and 1.09 % increase and 2.37% decrease in market index respectively. The ECM model
indicates that 26 % of the deviations of stock returns are corrected in the short run. Finally, Granger causality analysis suggests the existence of unidirectional causality from inflation, money supply and T-bill to market index. Therefore, it is suggested that investors should consider the impact of monetary policy during constructing their portfolios and making investment decisions.

AU  - Cecchetti, Stephen G.

AB  - Over the past twenty years, macroeconomic performance has improved markedly in industrialized and developing countries alike. Both inflation and real growth are more stable now than they were in the 1980s. This stability has been accompanied by dramatic changes in financial structure. We examine the connection between these concurrent events using data from 23 developed and emerging markets countries. There are a number of possible explanations for the widespread improvement in economic outcomes over the past two decades. There is the very real possibility that the world has become a more stable place. Alternatively, monetary policymakers may have become more skillful in carry out their stabilization objectives. That is, the monetary policy of the 1990s may have been more efficient than it was in the 1980s. We provide evidence that policy has in fact improved, suggesting that a rise in the competence of central bankers. But the ability of policymakers to carry out their job depends crucially on their having the tools necessary to reduce inflation and output volatility. The transmission of these interest rate movements to domestic output and prices depends on the structure of the country's banking system and financial markets. We show that a reduction in direct state ownership of banking system assets and the introduction of explicit deposit insurance can help explain the simultaneous improvement in the efficiency of monetary policy and stabilization of the macroeconomy.

TI  - Monetary policy and business cycles in the interwar years: The Scandinavian experience
AU  - Klovland, Jan T.
T2  - European Review of Economic History
AB  - Evidence from newly constructed monthly indices of manufacturing production shows that differences between the Scandinavian countries regarding business cycles in the interwar years were closely related to monetary policy decisions. In the 1920s Sweden made an early return to gold, while Denmark and Norway experienced large fluctuations in nominal and real exchange rates before restoring the gold standard at the prewar parity in 1927–28. The differences in monetary policy were mirrored in the business cycle history; Denmark and Norway being alone in having a particularly severe contraction period in the years 1925–27, referred to as the gold-parity depression. The nominal depreciation of the effective exchange rates following the abandonment of the gold standard in September 1931 led to a significant real depreciation in all three countries. Econometric evidence confirms the view that the decision to leave gold was instrumental in dampening the contractionary business cycle impulses from abroad during the years of the Great Depression.

Whereas, when asset markets were growth-supporting, the Fed did not raise interest rates. This asymmetry contributed to a downward-trend in interest rates which pushed US interest rates down to zero in the current crisis.

AB  - This paper focuses on investigating the relationship between monetary policy and stock market indices based on system theoretical analysis and empirical testing using vector autoregressive models. Our study reveals peculiarities of the relationship between monetary and stock market indicators in developed, successfully developing and moderately developing countries with high political and economic risks. First, we described theoretical aspects of the monetary policy mechanism that influences stock market development. Second, we systematized key economic variables and mathematical models that are widely used in the literature for similar studies. Third, we empirically demonstrated that stock market has a significant impact on monetary indicators in most countries, whereas monetary policy with focus on stock market stimulation is only effective in developed economies. We concluded that the stock market in developing countries demonstrates weak reaction to short-term changes in monetary policy of central banks and mainly depends on their long-term relationship.

AB  - This paper assesses the effect of US monetary policy on South Africa during the period 1990–2018. We separately analyse and compare the effect of conventional monetary policy, before the Global Financial Crisis, and unconventional monetary policy, after the US monetary policy reached the zero-lower bound. Our impulse response function results indicate that monetary policy in South Africa responds mainly to local inflation, economic activity and financial conditions. While there is strong correlation between the global and South African financial cycle, the financial cycle is not transmitted to the real economy because of the sluggish response of industrial production and domestic credit, especially after the global financial crisis. We see this as an indication of the effects of structural issues to the real economy and constrained households’ balance sheet which has prevented the local economy to take advantage of low local interest rates and the global economic recovery after the crisis.

AB  - This study examines the impact of oil price uncertainty on the US industrial production by decomposing oil price volatility into permanent and transitory components. The decompositions provide important evidence on sources and asymmetric effects of oil price volatility. To estimate the component structure of volatility and to analyse the dynamic impacts of the volatility components, the study uses a threshold based CGARCH and VAR modelling over a period from 1980 to 2010 for the US economy. The CGARCH model estimates show significant asymmetric effect of oil price shock on the transitory oil price volatility. Dynamic impulse response functions obtained from the estimated VAR models reveal that there is a significant and prolonged dampening impact of increased transitory oil price volatility on industrial production. The results also suggest that shocks to transitory component induce increased volatility in the general price level and non-fuel commodity prices in the US. Variance decomposition analysis reconfirms that the transitory volatility is the second most important factor to explain the variance of industrial production. These results provide additional insights on the sources of oil price uncertainty and point to the need to direct US energy policies towards stabilising short-term uncertainties in oil prices.

AB  - We propose a simple method to quantify narratives from textual data, and identify “narrative monetary policy surprises” as the difference in narrative focus in central bank communication accompanying interest rate meetings and economic media coverage prior to those meetings. Identifying narrative surprises, using Norwegian data, provides surprise measures that are uncorrelated with conventional monetary policy surprises, and, in contrast to such surprises, have a significant effect on subsequent media coverage. Narrative monetary policy surprises lead to macroeconomic responses similar to what recent monetary policy literature associates with the information component of monetary policy communication, highlighting media's role as information intermediaries.

We extend the work of Ewing (2001a) for the case of Turkey by using the newly developed generalized forecast error variance decomposition technique [Koop et al. (1996), Pesaran and Shin (1998)]. Results suggest that the growth rate of money supply contain significant information for predicting variance of future forecast errors of stock returns. The results provide information which is important for building accurate asset pricing models, forecasting future stock market volatility and furthers our understanding of stock market behavior in Turkey.

Subsequently, we examine the role of monetary policy in wage inequality. We do not find compelling evidence that shows that monetary policy plays a role in exacerbating the racial wage gap. However, there is evidence that accommodative monetary policy plays a role in magnifying between-group wage inequalities but the impact occurs after 2008.

We find that a surprise Chinese monetary tightening brings about a widening in the short-term interest rate spread, a drop in the equity price, nominal depreciation against the RMB and real depreciation, and an improvement in the trade balance, on average, across the 26 B&R countries. Moreover, substantial heterogeneous effects emerge in the responses of the foreign real exchange rate and the trade balance in different groups in terms of the 26 countries' trade weights with China, capital openness, and national income levels. Finally, all the empirical evidence reveals that the expenditure switching effect plays an important role in facilitating the international transmission of China's monetary policy shock.

We compare the inference ability of the credit card-augmented Divisia monetary aggregates and credit card-augmented Divisia inside monetary aggregates to the conventional Divisia monetary aggregates, at all levels of monetary aggregation. Using cyclical correlations analysis and Granger causality tests, we find that both the conventional Divisia monetary aggregates and the credit card-augmented Divisia monetary aggregates are informative in predicting output. Moreover, during, and in the aftermath of the 2007–2009 financial crisis, the credit card-augmented Divisia measures of money are more informative when predicting real economic activity than the conventional Divisia monetary aggregates. We also find that broad Divisia monetary aggregates provide better measures of the flow of monetary services generated in the economy.

AB  - This paper investigates the impact of monetary policy surprises by the FED or Bundesbank/ECB on the return volatility of German stocks and bonds using a GARCH-M model. We show that stock return volatility is susceptible to monetary policy surprises in the United States, whereas monetary policy surprises in the Euro zone matter for bond return volatility. These findings are robust for other Euro zone stock markets, but not significant for other Euro zone bond markets. The empirical evidence also suggests that monetary policy surprises have larger effects on German stock return volatility in bear markets than in bull phases. Moreover, our results support the claim that stock return volatility can be negatively correlated with stock returns, contradicting predictions made by many asset pricing models (e.g., CAPM or ICAPM) and the empirical finding of an insignificant relationship often reported in the literature.

TI  - A ﬂexible short-rate based four factor arbitrage-free term structure model with an explicit monetary policy rule
AU  - Nyholm, Ken
AB  - I derive an arbitrage-free four-factor term structure model that facilitates direct parametrization of the short-term interest rate process. The interplay between macroeconomic variables and the term structure via a monetary policy reaction function, in the spirit of Taylor (1993), is therefore directly supported. I show that the proposed model is a constrained member of the canonical GDTSM family proposed by Joslin, Singleton, and Zhu (2011). The model’s loading structure bears close resemblance to that of the Svensson and S¨oderlind (1997) model, but it relies only on a single non-linear shape parameter, and the model is therefore easy to estimate. An empirical application to US data covering the period from 1961 to 2017 demonstrates that the proposed model ﬁts yields well, and that an embedded policy rule, including industrial production and the inﬂation rate, is statistically signiﬁcant and economically meaningful during this time-period.

TI  - Zero lower bound, unconventional monetary policy and indicator properties of interest rate spreads
AU  - Hännikäinen, Jari
T2  - Review of Financial Economics
AB  - This paper re-examines the out-of-sample predictive power of interest rate spreads when the short-term nominal rates have been stuck at the zero lower bound and the Fed has used unconventional monetary policy. Our results suggest that the predictive power of some interest rate spreads have changed since the beginning of this period. In particular, the term spread has been a useful leading indicator since December 2008, but not before that. Credit spreads generally perform poorly in the zero lower bound and unconventional monetary policy period. However, the mortgage spread has been a robust predictor of economic activity over the 2003–2014 period.

AB  - This paper empirically tests the dynamics of credit cards and monetary policy in the context of Indonesia. Using monthly data from 2006 to 2018 and a structural vector autoregressive model, our findings indicate that credit card usage is mainly driven by Indonesia’s fast economic growth over the last decade, which indeed reflects the role of credit cards in consumption smoothing. The study also finds that monetary policy transmission through the lending channel is weak, with a more prevalent role for exchange rates and global oil prices in the transmission process.

TI  - Effect of Monetary Policy on Commercial Banks Across Different Business Conditions
AU  - Harun, Syed M.
AU  - Hassan, M. Kabir
AU  - Zaher, Tarek S.
AB  - The objective of the paper is to investigate whether the stock price reactions of commercial banks to monetary policy actions are dependent on the state of the economy. The results indicate that monetary policy actions have asymmetric effects on the returns of commercial banks across different monetary policy and business environments. The asymmetric effects can primarily be attributed to the asymmetric effects of monetary policy on discount rates across different monetary and business environments. We also observe that the impact of monetary policy on the returns of commercial banks is affected by bank-specific characteristics. Bank size, leverage and profitability play an important role in explaining the cross-sectional variation in bank returns as a result of monetary policy changes. We find that cross-sectional bank-specific characteristics affect the bank returns asymmetrically as a result of monetary policy changes across different business conditions. The results suggest that the effectiveness of monetary policy depends on the states of the economy.

TI  - Monetary Policy E¤ects on the Yield Curve: the Brazilian experience from 2004 to 2008
AU  - Wu, Thomas
AB  - This paper provides empirical evidence of the in‡uence exerted by the Monetary Policy Committee of the Central Bank of Brazil (Copom) on the yield curve between 2004 and 2008. We show that macroeconomic surprises that lead agents to revise their in‡ation forecasts also prompt them to expect future movements in the Selic rate in a manner that is consistent with the In‡ation Targeting regime. Nonetheless, if the Copom believes that the market has either over or under reacted to a particular piece of information, it may express its own view regarding the economic outlook by surprising the market with a di¤erent than expected change in the Selic rate. We also …nd that the longer end of the yield curve tends to steepen after a more aggressive than expected interest rate cut, and that international capital ‡ows are the most important drivers of the long-term rates (a possible explanation for the Brazilian version of the interest rate “conundrum”).

TI  - Evidence about the transmission of monetary policy
AU  - Laine, Olli-Matti
T2  - 123456789/18450
AB  - This doctoral dissertation analyses the transmission of monetary policy. It applies a variety of empirical methods to study how conventional and unconventional monetary policy measures transmit to different macroeconomic and financial variables. The first article analyses the effect of monetary policy on the term structure of stock market risk premia. The implied term structure is solved in a novel way utilizing equity analysts’ dividend forecasts and dividend future prices. The results show that monetary policy affects risk premia differently at different discounting horizons. Monetary policy easing lowers the short-horizon premia and raises the long-horizon premia. The effect on the average risk premium is positive. The second article studies the effect of targeted longer-term refinancing operations on bank lending. The results suggest that these targeted operations stimulated bank lending to firms. However, no evidence about a positive effect on lending to households is found. The third article examines the effects of conventional monetary policy during the 2008 financial crisis and the era of ultra-low interest rates. Several earlier studies conclude that the effects of conventional monetary policy shocks stayed almost the same during and after the financial crisis. Revisiting this research question, the findings suggest that the impulse response functions of industrial production and unemployment changed drastically after the financial crisis.

TI  - Volatility spillovers of unconventional monetary policy to emerging market economies
AU  - Apostolou, Apostolos

T2  - Economic Modelling
AB  - Emerging market economies (EMEs) have experienced waves of market volatility since the global financial crisis, with some commentators ascribing this at least partly related to monetary policy decisions in advanced economies. This paper examines volatility spillovers from changes in the size of the balance sheets of the Federal Reserve (FED) and European Central Bank (ECB) to EMEs from 2003 to 2018. We find that volatility spillovers to EME currency markets are greater in magnitude from the FED, while EME stock and bond markets are also vulnerable to volatility spillovers in a similar magnitude from both the ECB and the FED. We find only limited evidence of volatility transmission to the real economy of EMEs following the monetary policy actions of the FED and ECB. Finally, we show that the proportion of the volatility in EMEs that is accounted for by changes in FED and ECB balance sheets shifts over time. Our paper has important policy implications for EMEs, notably in respect of volatility transmission channels.
