AU  - Laine, Olli-Matti
AB  - This paper estimates the effect of monetary policy on the term structure of stock market risk premia. The implied stock market risk premia are obtained using analysts’ dividend forecasts and dividend future prices. The effect of monetary policy on risk premia is analysed using local projections and VAR models. According to the results, monetary policy easing raises the average risk premium. The effect is driven by a rise in long-horizon risk premia.

TI  - On the Effects of Monetary Policy Shocks on Exchange Rates
AU  - Binder, Michael
AU  - Chen, Qianying
AU  - Zhang, Xuan
AB  - In this paper we re-consider the effects of monetary policy shocks on exchange rates and forward premia. In the recent empirical literature, these effects have been predominantly described as puzzling, in that they would include delayed overshooting of the exchange rate as well as persistent deviations from uncovered interest parity. We specify an empirical model that in particular (i) allows for simultaneous multi-country adjustments in response to monetary policy shocks, and (ii) takes advantage of the identifying restrictions for monetary policy shocks implied by empirically supported long-run relations between the macroeconomic variables under consideration. Using monthly data from 1978 to 2006 for a panel of nine industrial economies (Australia, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, New Zealand, United Kingdom, and the United States), we find that U.S. Dollar effective and bilateral real exchange rates appreciate on impact after a contractionary U.S. monetary policy shock, and that there is no delay in the overshooting of the U.S. Dollar. Furthermore, there is no persistent significant forward premium. These results are consistent with the real exchange rate effects of monetary policy shocks in sticky price macroeconomic models, though the results of this paper also suggest that the latter models should be specified so as to capture simultaneous multi-country adjustments to shocks.

TI  - THE EFFECTIVENESS OF MONETARY POLICY IN INDIA: PRE AND POST REFORMS COMPARISONS
T2  - International Journal of Social Science and Economic Research
AB  - In this study, impact of Money Supply on output and inflation level has been analyzed for the time period 1971:M1 to 2017:M12. The Johansen Cointegration Technique and Vector Error Correction Mechanism has been applied for the full period (1971:M1 to 2017:M12), Pre-Reform Period (1971:M1 to 1991:M12 and Post-Reform Period (1992:M1 to 2017:M12). The index of Industrial Production (IIP), Wholesale Price Index (WPI) and Broad Money (M3) has been used as an indicator of output, inflation and monetary policy, respectively. It has been proved empirically that in India, Money Supply (M3) positively and significantly affects the output (IIP) and Inflation (WPI) level for the full period as well as for the post-reform period. On the other hand, during the pre-reform period, money supply was not targeting the price level, rather only satisfying its objective of output growth. This paper has also made an effort to conduct a comparative analysis of direct effect of M3 on WPI and IIP and indirect effects of M3 on IIP through the channel of WPI. It has been found that money supply can alter output level in a better way when it targets IIP directly as compared to an indirect route. Moreover, the impact of changes in money supply changes remains unbothered in both the direct as well as indirect route.

AB  - We study the possible asymmetric effect of monetary policy on house prices under different credit regimes. We first derive the implications of a theoretical model in which agents may be collateral-constrained. We then empirically examine the implications of the model using the threshold vector autoregression model. Two different measures reflecting the tightness of the credit market are computed to serve as the threshold variable. We find that house prices react to a monetary shock initially more strongly but the effect is less persistent in a credit boom regime than in a normal credit regime. This result is consistent with the findings of our theoretical model.

AB  - The relevance of bank lending channel for the transmission process of monetary policy in Malaysia is investigated using the autoregressive-distributed lag (ARDL) model. The newly developed bounds test (Pesaran, et al. 2001) is employed to determine the specification of this model. Deposits tend to fall following contractionary monetary policy shocks, but banks are able to cushion their loan customers from the reduction in deposits through adjustments in liquid financial instruments. As such, these monetary shocks did not depress growth in loans. Although a shift is witnessed in the country's interest rate regime as a policy response to the recent East Asian currency crisis, evidence was not found to support the effectiveness of the bank lending channel for the transmission of monetary policy.

T2  - Center for Economic Research (RECent)
AB  - We use the structural factor model proposed by Forni, Giannone, Lippi and Reichlin (2007) to study the effects of monetary policy. The advantage with respect to the traditional vector autoregression model is that we can exploit information from a large data set, made up of 112 US monthly macroeconomic series. Monetary policy shocks are identified using a standard recursive scheme, in which the impact effects on both industrial production and prices are zero. Such a scheme, when applied to a VAR including a suitable selection of our variables, produces puzzling results. Our main findings are the following. (i) The maximal effect on bilateral real exchange rates is observed on impact, so that the “delayed overshooting” or “forward discount” puzzle disappears. (ii) After a contractionary shock prices fall at all horizons, so that the price puzzle is not there. (iii) Monetary policy has a sizable effect on both real and nominal variables. Such results suggest that the structural factor model is a promising tool for applied macroeconomics.

T2  - Ekonomick&#253; časopis
AB  - After introduction of Euro since January 2009 the Slovak Republic does not perform its independent monetary policy but is affected by the Euro area policy including common interest rates. Interbank interest rate is considered as a proxy-variable aggregating overall monetary policy setting. The objective of the paper is to evaluate compatibility of the Euro area interest rates with macroeconomic situation in Slovakia. In other words, the key question is whether common interest rates respond sufficiently to inflation gap, output gap or other indicators. Reaction function is estimated via linear regression with the Newey-West approach for the pre-Euro period as well as Euro period in the Slovak Republic. Results demonstrate that the Euro area interbank interest rates did not react sufficiently neither to Slovak inflation nor output gap. These led to extremely low inflation during last month approaching the critical point of deflation with possible negative impacts on Slovak economy.

TI  - Monetary Policy in Japan: A Structural VAR Analysis
AU  - Kasa, Ken
AU  - Popper, Helen
T2  - Journal of the Japanese and International Economies
AB  - This paper studies the objectives and operating procedures of the Bank of Japan (BOJ) during the period 1975–1994. It uses a modified version of the structural VAR of Bernanke and Mihov, which nests several alternative hypotheses concerning central bank behavior. The approach allows for separate identification of the anticipated and unanticipated components of monetary policy, and it is capable of distinguishing between interest rate targeting and various types of reserve targeting. Three main results emerge from the analysis. First, no single target can explain the BOJ's behavior. Instead, the BOJ appears to weight both variation in the call money rate and variation in nonborrowed reserves, with the weight on the call money rate increasing over time. Second, there is strong evidence that at times the BOJ has employed “moral suasion” to counter shocks in the demand for borrowed reserves. However, by the second half of the 1980s, this procedure was no longer being used. Third, plots of the overall stance of monetary policy and its unanticipated component clearly reveal that a sharp monetary contraction occurred between early 1990 and late 1992, with an equally sharp expansion since then. Perhaps surprisingly, both the contraction and the subsequent expansion appear to have occurred largely in response to prevailing economic conditions, rather than as an unanticipated change in policy.J.

AB  - In this study we use the Bayesian VAR framework to provide an analysis of the transmission mechanism of the monetary policy. We develop a BVAR model for the Romanian economy in order to identify the major shock in Romania of the last 10 years and to provide information concerning the evolution of the economy response to these shocks. That's why, we have included in the analysis variables that emphasize the industrial production evolution, the exchange rate, the inflation, the real estate prices, the monetary aggregate M2 and the interest rate. The analysis shows important conclusions. The exchange rate remains an important mechanism that influences significantly the variables of the real economy, but the channel of the interest rate is being more and more consistent in the last years. The positive aspect that emerges from this study is related to the absence of output puzzle and price puzzle.

Our results indicate that the euro area’s monetary authority continues to increase/decrease their money supply to stimulate/depress the economy. In Japan, long-term economic recession motivated the Japanese government to maintain a loose money supply. The continuity of Korea’s monetary policy in expansionary states lasts up to 5.1 years. Besides, the outcomes show the implementation of U.S. quantitative easing (QE), overnight reverse repurchase agreement (RRP), and Chinese RRP policies have significant spillover effects on other nations. Particularly, the effects on the euro area are the largest. Furthermore, although the monetary policies of China and the euro area seem to move in opposite directions, they are interdependent.

AB  - This study examines the impact of the Federal Reserve (Fed) monetary policy on US hospitality stock returns. Specifically, this research paper investigates the stock performance of US hospitality firms under different Fed monetary policy regimes. Hospitality companies include gambling firms, lodging companies and restaurants. Changes in the discount rate and federal funds rate are used to measure shifts in the Fed monetary policy and to classify the full monetary policy period as either a restrictive or an expansive monetary policy environment. An expansive monetary condition is a period with a decrease in the discount or federal funds rate; a restrictive monetary environment experiences an increase in the discount or federal funds rate. Empirical test results reveal that the influence of the two monetary policy indicators on hospitality stock returns varies to a great extent. The stock returns of US restaurants are related significantly to changes in the federal funds rate. However, changes in the discount rate generally have no strong impact on US hospitality stock returns.

We separately model innovation to ECB key interest rate representing standard interest rate policy as exogenous variable and effects of balance sheet policies through change in claims against domestic sector of individual central banks as endogenous variable. By incorporating banking sector, we specifically examine effects of monetary policy on credit provisioning in individual countries. This model is applied on Slovenian economy after the euro adoption in 2007. Our results suggest that while standard interest rate policy has an effect on long-term interest rates for government bonds and interest rates on loans to households, the balance sheet policy brings about an additional impulse affecting bank interest rates but fails to affect bank spreads, government bonds or directly the credit provisioning.

TI  - Stock Market Volatility Transmission in Malaysia: Islamic Versus Conventional Stock Market
AU  - Yusof, Rosylin Mohd
AU  - Abd. Majid, M. Shabri
AB  - This study attempts to explore the extent to which the conditional volatilities of both conventional and Islamic stock markets in Malaysia are related to the conditional volatility of monetary policy variables. Among the monetary policy variables tested in the study are the narrow money supply (M1), the broad money supply (M2), interest rates (TBR), exchange rate (MYR), and Industrial Production Index (IPI), while the Kuala Lumpur Composite Index (KLCI) and Rashid Hussain Berhad Islamic Index (RHBII) are used as measures for conventional and Islamic stock markets, respectively. In order to capture the international influence on both stock markets, the volatility in the U.S. monetary policy variable measured by the Federal Funds Rate (FFR) is incorporated into the study. Unlike our earlier study (Mohd. Yusof and Abd. Majid, 2006) that employed the Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity (GARCH)-M, GARCH (1,1) framework together with Vector Autoregressive (VAR) analysis are employed for the monthly data starting from January 1992 to December 2000 in this study. The study finds that interest rate volatility affects the conventional stock market volatility but not the Islamic stock market volatility. This highlights the tenet of Islamic principles that the interest rate is not a significant variable in explaining stock market volatility. Our finding provides further support that stabilizing interest rate would have insignificant impact on the volatility of the Islamic stock markets.

AU  - Böck, Maximilian

AB  - We employ a time-varying parameter vector autoregression to study whether the international spillovers of U.S. monetary policy have changed in light of the rising globalization in real and financial markets. Identification of U.S. shocks is achieved via a high-frequency instrumental variable approach. Our results point to a growing role of the Fed's policy actions in driving global real activity. The negative effects of a U.S. tightening have more than doubled over the last three decades, reaching their peak during the great recession. Time-variation in spillovers is mainly driven by the growing macroeconomic integration and the rise of emerging economies (via composition effects) and is responsible for increasing domestic effects through spillbacks. In contrast, we find milder evidence in favour of rising effects on the global financial cycle.

AB  - In the recent past there are remarkable financial innovations in Pakistan which have the implications for the monetary policy. In Pakistan there is no or little empirical evidence on the impact of financial innovation on monetary policy transmission mechanism. In this paper we fill this gap by analyzing the impact of financial innovation on monetary policy transmission mechanism by using the interest rate channel. We use the quarterly date covering the period, 1981Q1 to 2010Q4 for Pakistan and for estimation we use OLS. We found that the interest rate channel of monetary policy transmission mechanism dampens by the interest rate channel.

TI  - The Interaction between financial markets and monetary policy
AU  - Murgia, Lucia
AB  - This thesis deals with the interaction between financial markets and monetary policy from three different perspectives. First, I study the perspective of equity investors and their reaction to the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) announcements, when they disagree on Nominal Interest Rate level decisions. My evidence shows that investor expectations formulated prior to FOMC announcements have a significant impact on equity prices, particularly when these expectations are not aligned with the FOMC committee decisions. My results reconcile past findings on the monetary policy surprise literature and more recent empirical findings on the effect of FOMC announcements on equity markets. Moreover, as I find no effect on equity returns when the FOMC committee decision is anticipated by the market, a practical implication of my study is that monetary policy authorities should take into account market expectations when formulating disclosure policy in order to improve alignment with financial market expectations and smooth out their economic consequences.
Second, I provide evidence of the effects of the European Central Bank (ECB) monetary policy shocks on the real economy, specifically on industrial production and inflation. This analysis investigates how the ECB monetary policy shocks impact industrial production (output) and inflation (prices) following the established narrative methodology of Romer & Romer (2004). Past standard statistical approaches have yielded very limited results in terms of magnitude. The narrative methodology, conversely, has yielded significant effects of monetary shocks on prices and output. Most of these studies analysed the effect of monetary policy in the United States and only a recent portion of the literature has extended the analysis to other countries (United Kingdom and Canada). This chapter contributes to the extant literature in extending the narrative methodology to the Eurozone and adapting it to include the unconventional monetary policies put in place by the Governing Council of the ECB in the past decade. To do so, I gather a novel dataset of macroeconomic forecasts and construct a new measure of monetary policy shocks. Industrial production responds to unpredictable monetary policy shocks with a decline of over 0.5%. On the contrary, inflation responds weakly to monetary shocks, with a very modest and unstable decrease of 0.05%. Furthermore, I provide empirical evidence of the heterogeneous responses of inflation and output among Eurozone countries. These last results are particularly relevant to policy makers of the ECB Governing Council, given that their policy decisions should have a homogenous effect on the Eurozone economy.
Third, I investigate whether financial market stability is a concern for monetary policy makers in the case of the European Central Bank (ECB) and Bank of England (BOE). Whether financial market stability should be a concern of monetary policy makers is an unresolved and long debated question, which has resurfaced after the 2008 financial crisis. In this chapter, I propose a forward-looking Augmented Taylor (1993) Rule to investigate the conduct of monetary policy and apply this idea to the 2003–2018 time period for both the ECB and the BOE. I show that a forward-looking Augmented Taylor Rule explains the deviation of observed rates consistent with its implied rates. By including a measure of Financial Market Stability Slack, I also show that the evolving preferences of monetary policy makers have taken into account the financial markets turmoil, particularly in the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis.

TI  - The Stock Market Channel Of Monetary Policy In Emerging Markets: Evidence From The Istanbul Stock Exchange
AU  - Berument, M. Hakan
AU  - Kutan, Ali
AB  - Studies on the existence of the stock market channel of monetary policy in emerging markets are scant. We examine the impact of monetary policy on stock returns in Turkey's emerging economy during the post-1980 liberalization period. Evidence indicates that monetary policy affects returns with the strongest influence on the Financial and Services sectors. However, the impact is short lived, ranging between 9 and 24 months, depending upon the index used, suggesting that monetary policy is neutral. Overall, the results indicate that asset prices may provide an additional channel through which monetary policy affects short-run economic activity and hence business cycles. Given the increasing role of the stock market in emerging economies and the greater globalization of financial markets in general, central banks in these countries are well advised to pay close attention to the impact of stock market developments on economic activity, besides their traditional focus on the bond and foreign exchange markets.

AB  - This paper provides new evidence on the transmission of monetary policy shocks to the real economy and to credit markets. The identiﬁcation of monetary policy shock is based on a high-frequency event study analysis. Two key results emerge from the analysis for the Great Moderation period. First, monetary policy shocks were a key driver of business and credit market conditions, explaining 35% of the forecast error of industrial production and 50% of the excess bond premium. Second, monetary policy shocks explain all movement in the excess bond premium correlated with real activity leaving no role for exogenous disruptions in credit intermediation. Finally, we extend our analysis to include the Great Recession and to examine the role of unconventional monetary policy.

AB  - The joint effect of the global economic and sovereign debt crisis forced the European Central Bank (ECB) to apply conventional and non-standard expansionary monetary policy interventions in order to stabilize eurozone economies. We conducted a panel regression econometric analysis to study the influence of euro area monetary authority policy interventions, along with two main macroeconomic variables and a sentiment indicator, on market equity returns of eurozone countries for the period January 2007 to December 2017. Our findings suggest that conventional and non-standard monetary policy innovations had a positive lagged impact on equity returns of euro area monetary markets. More specifically, interest rate cuts evenly influenced market indices while non-conventional actions mainly affected core eurozone countries that were less affected by the crisis. We also document a strong negative relationship between inflation rates and market returns. In addition, the sentiment indicator produces positive effects on returns because it contains information that is not incorporated into other macro variables.

T2  - Eurasian Economic Review
AB  - This paper investigates the impact of the monetary policies in 3 countries (the Republic of Korea, China and the United States) on the Korean stock markets (e.g., KOSPI), using a structural Vector Autoregression. We find that a positive shock in Money Supply (M2) in all 3 countries is positive to the Korean stock markets but the degree of the response differs from one another. Surprisingly, the response of the KOSPI was largest to China’s M2, reflecting that China is Korea’s largest trading partner. From the responses of Korea’s industrial production and CPI, we speculate that a possibility of liquidity trap was not ruled out in some periods. We also find that the KOSPI responded negatively to a positive shock in Korea’s policy rate while it rarely responded to the shocks in the China’s policy rate and the US federal fund rate. We consider that China’s policy rate did not affect Korea’s economic activities as it was not a main monetary policy tool. We also consider that Korea’s determination of policy rate was not fully free from the US monetary policy and thus any shock in the US federal fund rate was substantially mitigated in the KOSPI.

We find that stylized facts for aggregate monetary and real variables are remarkably similar to what has been found for the US by many studies while we uncover new facts on disaggregated loans and deposits. During the crisis the cyclical behavior of short term interest rates, loans and deposits remain stable but we identify unusual dynamics of longer term loans, deposits and longer term interest rates.

AB  - A number of recent papers have hypothesized that the Federal Reserve possesses information about the course of inflation and output that is unknown to the private sector, and that policy actions by the Federal Reserve convey some of this superior information. We conduct two tests of this hypothesis: 1) could monetary policy surprises be used to improve the private sector's ex ante forecasts of subsequent macroeconomic statistical releases, and 2) does the private sector revise its forecasts of macroeconomic statistical releases in response to these monetary policy surprises? We find little evidence that Federal Reserve policy surprises convey superior information about the state of the economy: they could not systematically be used to improve forecasts of statistical releases and forecasts are not systematically revised in response to policy surprises. One possible exception to this pattern is Industrial Production, a statistic that the Federal Reserve produces.

AB  - Monetary transmission mechanism which is questioning the relationship between macro economic variables and monetary variables has been discussed from past to present. It is generally accepted that contractionary monetary shocks affect total consumption, employment and total output negatively. However, the leading position of countries’ properties (socio-economic, political etc.) on the relationship between real variables and monetary variables, create a debate among economists and ratify to make them precise evidence. The main aim of this paper is to analyze the effectiveness of narrow credit view on employment and output for Turkey. Within this framework, money supply, total loans, employment rates and industrial production index monthly variables are analyzed for the period of 2005-2010 by using VAR method. The results indicate that changes in money stock (m2) have an impact on real variables such as employment and output through credit stock.

TI  - Monetary Shocks and Stock Returns in an Emerging Market: A Var Analysis

T2  - Savings and Development
AB  - The present paper analyzes the stock prices - money supply interactions in a five-variable framework, which includes, in addition to the two focal variables, real industrial production, aggregate price level, and exchange rate. The dynamic interactions among the variables are based on variance decompositions and impulse-response functions generated from the VAR. Using monthly data from 1977.1 - 1997.6, we document findings suggestive of the dominant influence of monetary variables on the stock price movements. In particular, the evidence seems to indicate a unidirectional causality from money to stock prices with money exerting a temporary wealth effect on the stock prices. Additionally, we find (a) a positive stock price - consumer price link; (b) a pro-cyclical monetary policy, and (c) an exchange rate stabilization of monetary policy. The inclusion of the crisis years (1997.7 - 1998.8) does not seem to affect these basic results. Indeed, it only intensifies the extent to which economic shocks affect stock price movements and makes the effects of exchange rate on other variables more pronounced.

AU  - Beckworth, David
T2  - International Finance
AB  - The eurozone crisis represents one of the greatest economic tragedies of the past century. It has caused immense human suffering, which continues to this day. The standard view attributes the economic crisis to an earlier buildup of public and private debt that was augmented by the imposition of austerity during the crisis. Although evidence exists of a relationship between the debt buildup, austerity measures, and economic growth during the crisis, that same evidence, on closer examination, points to eurozone countries’ common monetary policy as the real culprit behind the area's sharp decline in economic activity. In particular, it seems that the European Central Bank's tightening of monetary policy in 2008 and again in 2010–2011 not only caused two recessions but also sparked the sovereign debt crisis and gave teeth to the austerity programs. Such findings point to the need for a new monetary policy regime in the eurozone. The case is made for the new regime to be a targeted growth path for total money spending.

AB  - We investigate the effects of a US economic policy uncertainty shock on some Euro area macroeconomic aggregates via Structural VARs. We model the indicators of economic policy uncertainty recently developed by  Baker et al. (2013) jointly with the aggregate price indexes and alternative indicators of the business cycle for the two above indicated economic areas. According to our SVARs, a one standard deviation shock to US economic policy uncertainty leads to a statistically significant fall in the European industrial production and prices of −0.12% and −0.06%, respectively. The contribution of the US uncertainty shock on the European aggregates is shown to be quantitatively larger than the one exerted by an Euro area-specific uncertainty shock.

AU  - Odedokun, M. O.
T2  - The Nigerian Journal of Economic and Social Studies
AB  - Monetary policy is conducted in the financial sector with a view to getting its effect transmitted to the real sector. Economists are divided, however, as to the magnitude of the effects of monetary policy on the real sector. On the one side are Keynesians, who contend that monetary policy has very little effect. On the other side, the monetarists are of the opinion that monetary policy does have an impact on the real sector. This paper examines the existence, in Nigeria's economy, of causalities between the various measures of monetary policy actions (viz.: total domestic credit, monetary base, narrow money, and wider money) and the various measures of the state of the economy (viz.: industrial production, price level, imports, and GDP) which the monetary actions might aim at. The objectives are to shed light on the controversies between the monetarists and Keynesians as to the direction of causation; to improve the model building process and enhance the conduct of monetary policy in Nigeria; and to contribute to the econometric issue as to whether or not the two causality tests of Granger (1969) and Sims (1972) produce the same results. The author used quarterly data for Nigeria over the period 1971-1985 and both the Granger's and Sims' test procedures. The findings, in almost all cases, contradict the monetarist position. In most cases, the two tests unanimously support the hypothesis of an absence of causality

Sub-sample analysis, motivated by variation in the realized premia and parameter instability, reveals that the impact of monetary policy shocks on these portfolios is significant and pronounced only during the pre-1983 period.

TI  - Short and Long Run Asymmetric Effects of Monetary and Fiscal Policy Uncertainty on Economic Activity in the U.S
AU  - Aye, Goodness C.
T2  - Working Papers
AB  - This paper extends the ongoing literature on the macroeconomic effects of monetary and fiscal policy uncertainty. It examined the asymmetric effects of monetary and fiscal policy uncertainty on economic activity in the short and long run using U.S. monthly data from 1985M1 to 2017M2. The industrial production index is used as a measure of economic activity while the Baker et al (2016) news based monetary and fiscal policy uncertainty were used as measures of uncertainty. To analyse asymmetry, the paper employed the nonlinear autoregressive distributed lag (NARDL) model which allows one not only to capture the effects of positive and negative uncertainty but to do so in both short and long run. Hence this paper provides new evidence of possible existence of a nonlinear and asymmetric relationship between policy uncertainty and economic activity in the short and long run. The results show that monetary and fiscal policy uncertainty share long run relationship with economic activity. Further, the effect of monetary and fiscal policy uncertainties in the long run is asymmetric. Asymmetric effect in the short run was supported only for monetary policy uncertainty. These findings have important practical and policy implications.

AU  - Levant, Jared
AU  - Ma, Jun
T2  - Journal of Empirical Finance
AB  - We employ the Dynamic Nelson–Siegel (DNS) model augmented with macroeconomic factors to investigate interactions of yields, real economic activity, and monetary policy in the United Kingdom. By explicitly accounting for the structural break during the early 90s at the time the UK exited the Exchange Rate Mechanism of the European Monetary System, we document a number of interesting findings. Specifically, there is evidence of a great moderation in the volatility of the term structure post-1992. At the same time, there is a significant reduction of the loading parameter in the DNS model, which suggests a greater influence of monetary policy and economic activity on the UK bond market. We find that the level and slope yield curve factors are related to inflation expectations and monetary policy, respectively, as has been found in related literature. Interestingly, the curvature factor which has been elusive in its relationship to macroeconomic fundamentals is found to be more strongly related to economic activity post-1992.

TI  - ECB Monetary Policy: How well does the Taylor Rule describe it?
AU  - Sauer, Stephan
AU  - Sturm, Jan-Egbert
AB  - Over the last decade, the simple instrument policy rule developed by Taylor (1993) has become a popular tool for evaluating monetary policy of central banks. As an extensive empirical analysis of the ECB’s past behaviour still seems to be in its infancy, we estimate several instrument policy reaction functions for the ECB which might shed a light on actual monetary policy in the euro area in the recent past and answer questions like whether the ECB has actually followed a stabilising or a destabilising rule so far? Looking at contemporaneous Taylor Rules, the presented evidence suggests that the ECB is accommodating changes in inflation and hence follows a destabilising policy. However, this impression seems to be largely due to the lack of a forward-looking perspective in such specifications. Either by assuming rational expectations and using a forward-looking specification, or using expectations as derived from surveys result in Taylor Rules which do imply a stabilising role of the ECB. The use of real-time industrial production data does not seem to play such a significant role as in the case of the U.S.

AB  - In recent years there has been a particular interest in the relation between exchange rates and interest rates both in developed countries and emerging countries. This is understandable given the important role that these variables have in determining the movement of nominal and real economic variables, including the movement of domestic inflation, real output, exports and imports, foreign exchange reserves, etc. To realized the importance of the given instruments selected macroeconomic indicators, data analysis (monthly data) relating to Serbia was made on the basis of the Transfer Function Model, a data analysis (annual data) relating to emerging countries was done on the basis of the Stepvise Multiple Regression model. In the transfer function model we used the Maximum Likelihood method for assessing unknown coefficients. In the gradual multiple regression model we used the Least Square method for the evaluation of unknown coefficients. All indicator values w ere used in the original unmodified form, i.e. there was no need for a variety of transformations. Empirical analysis showed that the exchange rate is a more significant transmission mechanism than the interest rate both in emerging markets and Serbia.

AB  - Renewable energy has emerged as a key to attain higher economic growth without any detrimental impact on the environment. Therefore, the entire world is in the transition phase from non-renewables to renewables. To improve the levels of production of renewable energy, it is inevitable to discern its determinants. Hence, this study aims to probe the impact of monetary, fiscal, and trade policy uncertainty on renewable energy production in the United States. To this end, the novel smooth and sharp structural breaks unit root test is used to scrutinize the order of integration. Next, we also apply the novel augmented autoregressive distributed lag methodology for discerning cointegration. The findings note that, in the long- and short-run, monetary policy uncertainty plunges the production of renewable energy, whereas fiscal policy uncertainty upsurges it. Further, trade policy uncertainty does not affect renewable energy production. Based on these results, we propose policy suggestions that could expedite the transition to renewables.

AU  - Rossiter, R. D.
T2  - The Quarterly Review of Economics and Finance
AB  - This paper investigates the role of the monetary aggregates after deregulation as well as an alternative credit view of the monetary transmission mechanism. The credit view, based on the assumptions that not all financial assets are perfect substitutes and not all agents are identical, suggests that the spread between the commercial paper and Treasury bill rates may serve as an indicator of monetary policy. Other interest rate spreads which might be useful are a term-structure spread and a private-public risk spread. Johansen 's multivariate tests for cointegration are used to determine whether a set of variables including the federal funds rate, an indicator variable, a monetary aggregate, output and the price level are linked in a single cointegration relationship. Empirical results strongly support the hypothesis of cointegration when M1 is included as an intermediate target. The commercial paper-Treasury bill and term structure spreads serve as monetary policy indicators, but the private-public risk spread responds to changes in output rather than serving as an indicator.

AB  - This study presents evidence on the effect of domestic and Euro Area monetary policy on stock prices in four new EU member states of Central Europe and the main determinants of stock price volatility, estimating structural vector autoregressive models identified with short-run restrictions. We find that stock prices in the considered new EU member states are more sensitive to changes in the Euro Area interest rate than to the domestic one. Moreover, the bulk of stock price volatility in these countries is due to shocks related to exchange rate and Euro Area monetary policy. Overall, we find that local stock markets are more sensitive to external shocks than to domestic ones.

AB  - Using the factor-augmented vector autoregressive (FAVAR) model proposed by Bernanke et al. (2005), this study explores the effect of monetary policy on a wide range of macroeconomic and financial variables for the US, Canada and the UK. The study makes use of financial data from 1990 to 2016, comprising 55–70 variables of the three major nations to show (1) that factors come with additional informational capability, which summarizes the performance of key macroeconomic variables and (2) the manner in which these variables are affected by contractionary monetary policies. Our findings confirm that monetary policy tightening results in decrease in industrial production, employment, share prices, housing starts and inflation; however, it leads to increase in the three-month treasury bill rate, long-term interest rates and unemployment. Overall, the impact of standardized monetary tightening is similar across the countries studied. These results from the major economies and the inclusion of larger data sets containing more variables would be relevant for policy theorists and practitioners from other countries.

TI  - A New Monetary Policy Shock with Text Analysis
AU  - Ochs, A. C. R.
AB  - Measures of monetary shocks commonly give rise to the puzzling result where a monetary tightening has an expansionary effect. A possible reason is that agents may believe that monetary shocks contain information regarding the central bank’s assessment of the economic environment (Nakamura and Steinsson, 2018). Under this hypothesis, the estimated response to monetary policy shocks would contain two conflating effects: the actual effect of monetary policy and the reaction of private agents to the newly acquired information. This paper overcomes this problem by extracting a novel series of monetary shocks using text analysis methods on central bank documents. The resulting text-based variables contain the informational content from changes in the policy rate. Thus, they can be used to extract exogenous changes in monetary policy that are orthogonal to any central bank information. Using this information-free measure of monetary policy shocks reveals that a monetary tightening is not expansionary, even when estimated on more recent periods.

AU  - Pradhan, Sewak
AU  - Raju, Raghavender
AB  - Monetary policy has become an important part of any economic policy functioning in different countries of the world. Price stability has become the main objective of monetary policy keeping in mind economic growth. Since the deregulation of interest rate in 1994-1997, monetary transmission mechanism (the process of fulfilling the objectives of monetary policy) in India has under gone certain change. The globalisation of economy created more complexities in conduct of monetary policy with exposure to exogenous factors like oil price shock and federal fund rate. The Reserve Bank of India also made several changes in the base rate system in order to improve monetary transmission mechanism. A structural vector autoregressive model has been proposed and monthly data has been incorporated after post-liberalisation period April 1996-March 2017. Contractionary monetary policy has had adverse impact on output growth for a long run and increases the price level for short term in contrast to its decline and rises the issue of 'price puzzle'. The depreciation of exchange rate also encourages exporters to increase industrial production in turn raises the average price level due to increase in import cost. Exogenous factors like oil price shocks have negative impact on domestic output growth and raise inflation for long time horizon. This also propels to decrease stock prices marginally and also in turn effect exchange rate adversely. Increase in the US federal fund rate have detrimental effect on output growth for a year and has an immediate sharp impact on call money rate. Transmission from policy repo rate to marginal cost of lending rate (MCLR) has been found more than the transmission to Base rate system. Private sector banks respond faster contrary to the magnitude of Public sector banks.

AB  - We investigate how supply chain conditions influence the transmission of monetary policy. Using a nonlinear local projection framework and a new index of supply chain conditions, we find that greater pressure on supply chains amplifies the standard effects of monetary policy on key macroeconomic variables.  We argue that this is due to heightened financial frictions. Various measures of credit costs react more strongly to monetary policy when supply chain conditions are tight. The greater sensitivity of external finance premia in the high supply chain pressure state results in financially-constrained firms and households lowering their spending more following a contractionary monetary policy shock.

AB  - The article aims to bring to light the limits and contradictions of cryptocurrencies, as well as to investigate possible alternative uses of them. Particularly focusing on Bitcoin, understood as a benchmark for the entire sector, the authors seek to answer the following questions: Should Bitcoin be considered a currency, an investment vehicle, or a speculative asset? On which factors does Bitcoin volatility depend? Do Central Banks effectively have no power to influence/stabilize Bitcoin volatility? Following the empirical strategy proposed by Baek and Elbeck, the article shows that Bitcoin returns merely depend on financial conventions and that the cryptocurrency is acting as a highly speculative asset. Sociotechnical innovations introduced by Bitcoin, the authors argue, have concretely opened the possibility of deeply rethinking money. However, several factors are currently negatively affecting the possibility of the cryptocurrency to function as an effective means of payment. Whether this experience can pave the way for the birth of new and more democratic monetary instruments, as the article discusses, is an issue that calls into question a whole combination of political, technical and social elements.

Economists are divided, however, as to the magnitude of the effects of monetary policy on the real sector. On the one side are Keynesians, who contend that monetary policy has very little effect. On the other side, the monetarists are of the opinion that monetary policy does have an impact on the real sector. This paper examines the existence, in Nigeria's economy, of causalities between the various measures of monetary policy actions (viz.: total domestic credit, monetary base, narrow money, and wider money) and the various measures of the state of the economy (viz.: industrial production, price level, imports, and GDP) which the monetary actions might aim at. The objectives are to shed light on the controversies between the monetarists and Keynesians as to the direction of causation; to improve the model building process and enhance the conduct of monetary policy in Nigeria; and to contribute to the econometric issue as to whether or not the two causality tests of Granger (1969) and Sims (1972) produce the same results. The author used quarterly data for Nigeria over the period 1971-1985 and both the Granger's and Sims' test procedures. The findings, in almost all cases, contradict the monetarist position.

TI  - Towards a New Approach to Monetary Policy using a Multidimensional Evaluation: Malaysia as a Case Study
AU  - Alaoui, Abdelkader
AU  - Jusoh, Hashim
AB  - The paper offers a fresh perspective on the existing classical monetary policy that adopts the fixing of interest rates in the economy where interest rate is a function of the rate of unemployment and the rate of inflation in the economy (Taylors Rule, 2000). The authors posit that by directly fixing interest rates and prices in the economy it totally ignores the evolution of monetary aggregates. In this study we performed a multi-scale decomposition of monthly variables based on Malaysian data using the wavelet approach. In addition, we analysed the effect of LIBOR on the Malaysian monetary policy and we found that the interest rate of Malaysia is following the changes of LIBOR in most of the time, even though the Malaysian Index of Industrial Production (IIP) is not highly correlated with the IIP in the United Kingdom (UK).Our results bring new insights about the interactions between interest rates and the other economic aggregates in different time horizons. Finally in the conclusion we explored the potential applications of this innovative technique or approach onto Islamic economics and finance as a Shari'ah compliant approach towards monetary management which should take as its reference the return of the real sector in the economy rather than the interest rate.

AB  - Recognizing the importance of assessing the stock market's response to the shocks of monetary policy, many studies in Vietnam as well as all over the world have been carried out. Present to analyze this relationship. In this context, the study looks at the level of impact of transmission channels on the stock market volatility at the theoretical level combined with the use of quantitative methods to test the impact of monetary policy. To the stock market as well as the adverse impact from the stock market on monetary policy is necessary. Therefore, the authors decided to implement the theme "The relationship between monetary policy and Vietnam's securities market". Using the model of estimating monetary policy in Vietnam using data from January 2008 to June 2016, the author uses the VAR model to explore the relationship between monetary policy and the stock market, using factors money supply, interbank rates and foreign exchange reserves to represent the monetary policy, the VN-Index represents the stock market together with the impact of other macro variables such as oil price, industrial production index and consumer price index. The results show that during the crisis and post-crisis period, monetary policy did not affect directly on the stock market but impacted on inflation. Since then, the author has suggested that policymakers can analyze the impact of monetary policy on the stock market, thus introducing appropriate policies to adjust the movements of the stock market.

AB  - This paper compares several methods for estimating the effects of monetary innovations on key macroeconomic variables and, subsequently, clarifies issues related to the use of instrumental variables in the identification of structural impulse responses. In particular, we make explicit the property that a measure of monetary policy must satisfy in order to identify the effects of monetary shocks. Within our framework we find that none of the currently popular methods of identifying the effects of monetary shocks are supported by the data. We also indicate how current approaches can be combined to provide unbiased estimates of the effects of monetary disturbances.

AU  - Koo, Anthony Y. C.

AB  - The paper explores the incidence of restrictive monetary policy on firms of different market structures. It is argued that in the period of tight money, firms with backlogs are less likely to suffer a loss of sales or profit than those without backlogs because of the ability of the former to shift future production to the current period. Since firms with backlogs can only be found in the oligopolistic sector, we conclude that the burden of the restrictive monetary policy is more likely to fall on the firms in the competitive sector than those in the oligopolistic one.

AB  - The study empirically analyze monetary policy and industrial growth in Nigeria with data spanning from 1996-2019. The Statistical Bulletin of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) and World Development Indicators were used to compile the data. Descriptive statistics, Augmented Dickey Fuller (ADF) test, Granger causality, and Ordinary Least Square (OLS) were analytical tool used to test the hypotheses. E-Views 9.0 is used as the statistical tool for this study and Log of Industry Sector Gross domestic product (LogINGDP) as the dependent variable, Lending Rate (LR), Deposit interest rate (DPIR) and Money Supply annual growth Rate (M2) as the independent/explanatory variables. The study concludes that lending rate (LR), deposit interest rate (DPIR) and money supply growth rate (M2) as proxies for monetary policy have significant impact on industrial growth of developing countries, Nigeria in particular. That is, monetary policy is an effective means of improving industry growth as well as growth of the economy. The study recommends that Federal Government should review its monetary policies through the Central Bank on its instruments to boost industry sector growth of Nigeria.

AB  - Commodity price volatility has created concerns for central bank policy-makers. Recent commodity prices peaked in the consequences of the financial crisis of 2007, and they have remained relatively volatile since. As they are often seen as being connected in a cause and effect relationship with inflation and real output, the driving forces behind commodity price volatility are necessary for the conduct of monetary policy. Using an autoregressive moving average with an exponential generalized autoregressive conditional heteroscedastic (ARMA-EGARCH) process, we extract the conditional variance series to find volatility spillover between monetary policy and commodity price index. The findings show that the volatility of agricultural commodity price index and other commodities price indices overshoot the long-run equilibrium price in response to an impulse in monetary policy.

TI  - Monetary Policy Transmission Mechanisms in the Ceecs: How Important are the Differences with the Euro Area?
AU  - Creel, Jerome

AB  - We use a structural VAR model with short-term restrictions to investigate the relative importance of interest rate, exchange rate and credit channels in the monetary policy transmission (MPT) for the Czech Republic, Hungary and Poland over 1993:1-2004:3. Main results are as follows. First, in the three countries, following a positive shock on the interest rate, prices increase instead of decreasing, due to the immediate depreciation of the nominal exchange rate. The results thus exhibit an exchange rate puzzle conducing to the appearance of a price-puzzle. Second, none channel is very powerful for the MPT in the three countries. Nevertheless, the exchange rate and the interest rate channels play a growing role over the recent period in Poland, compared with the same channels in the Czech Republic and Hungary. As nominal exchange rate fluctuations allow for greater real shocks dampening in Poland, the cost of entering EMU may be more costly for this country than for the Czech Republic or Hungary.

AU  - Braun, R Anton
AB  - A cornerstone of monetary policy making is that a looser monetary policy is associated with lower interest rates, higher growth of narrow monetary aggregates, higher output and higher inflation. These responses, which we collectively refer to as the liquidity effect hypothesis, are at odds with some of the leading theoretical models of money. This paper proposes and implements a quasi-Bayesian methodology that allows us to compare the liquidity effect hypothesis with two other hypotheses: the sticky price hypothesis and the inflation tax hypothesis. Our results indicate that there is evidence against the liquidity effect hypothesis in U.S. data, but that a skeptical Bayesian decision maker would still assign most posterior weight it. For Japan, in contrast, even a skeptic would end up favoring the sticky price hypothesis. Journal of Economic Literature Classification numbers: E0, E5, F0.

TI  - Shifts in monetary policy and exchange rate dynamics: Is Dornbusch's overshooting hypothesis intact, after all?
AU  - Rüth, Sebastian K.
T2  - Journal of International Economics
AB  - How do nominal exchange rates adjust after surprise contractions in monetary policy? While the seminal contribution by Dornbusch provides concise predictions—exchange rates appreciate, i.e., overshoot on impact before depreciating gradually—empirical support for his hypothesis is at best mixed. I argue that the failure to discover overshooting may result from assumptions researchers have imposed to recover structural VARs. Specifically, simultaneous feedback effects between interest rates and exchange rates, which are inherently forward-looking variables, are often excluded or modeled alongside with strong restrictions. In this paper, I identify U.S. monetary policy shocks using surprises in Federal funds futures around policy announcements as external instruments, which recent literature has established to represent the appropriate laboratory in settings encompassing macroeconomic and financial variables. Resulting adjustments of the dollar, conditional on shifts in policy, generally align with Dornbusch's predictions during the post-Bretton-Woods era, including Volcker's tenure as Fed Chair.

TI  - Short and long run asymmetric effects of monetary and fiscal policy uncertainty on economic activity in the U.S.
AU  - Aye, Goodness Chioma
AB  - This paper extends the ongoing literature on the macroeconomic effects of monetary and fiscal policy uncertainty. It examined the asymmetric effects of monetary and fiscal policy uncertainty on economic activity in the short and long run using U.S. monthly data from 1985M1 to 2017M2. The industrial production index is used as a measure of economic activity while the Baker et al. (2016) news based monetary and fiscal policy uncertainty were used as measures of uncertainty. To analyse asymmetry, the paper employed the nonlinear autoregressive distributed lag (NARDL) model which allows one not only to capture the effects of positive and negative uncertainty but to do so in both short and long run. Hence this paper provides new evidence of possible existence of a nonlinear and asymmetric relationship between policy uncertainty and economic activity in the short and long run. The results show that monetary and fiscal policy uncertainty share long run relationship with economic activity. Further, the effect of monetary and fiscal policy uncertainties in the long run is asymmetric. Asymmetric effect in the short run was supported only for monetary policy uncertainty. These findings have important practical and policy implications.

AB  - This paper investigates the role of the monetary policy in protecting the economy against the external shocks of US output and oil price during the 2007-2009 financial crisis. It also considers economic vulnerability caused by these external shocks after the crisis abated. The application of the structural vector auto regression (SVAR) model using monthly data from 2002:M1 to 2013:M4 for Indonesia, Malaysia, and Thailand shows that poor influence of monetary policies on monetary policy transmission channels (namely, interest rate, exchange rate, domestic credit, and stock price) in the pre-crisis period could not shield these economies from shocks of oil price and US output. The results of post-crisis period indicate a significant increase in the positive impact of monetary policy on channels of monetary transmission channels compared to the pre-crisis period. However, these economies continue to remain vulnerable to oil price shocks.

AB  - Our paper focuses on the analysis and comparison of monetary policy impacts on industrial production and inflation in different EU countries. The Visegrad Group (VG) countries (Czech Republic, Slovak Republic, Poland and Hungary) and their specific impulse response dynamic behaviours are compared against each other and with selected euro zone countries. This comparison is based on a standardized VAR model specification (using monthly data from 2000 to 2011 for the underlying estimation). We use Blanchard-Quah [1] decomposition scheme to isolate macroeconomic shocks for further analysis. Alternative VAR model specifications may be used to generate impulse response functions with varied degrees of stratification and interpretation possibilities. We evaluate the homogeneity of expected costs of disinflationary monetary policy among VG countries by studying the impulse response dynamics of the output cost of disinflation. Our results indicate that VG countries do not exhibit a statistically significant symmetric behaviour in response to incurred monetary shocks. The nature of heterogeneous behaviour found is discussed and results are compared to previous studies with similar focus.

AB  - This paper investigates how money-income causality in the Asia is influenced by US interest rates and the money supply and which policy variable has a stronger impact on Asia. Six Asian economies are examined (Pakistan, India, Malaysia, Indonesia, Philippines and Korea) using an EGARCH model over the period 1970:Ql–2002:Q4. The results indicate that spillover effects from US interest rates and the money supply unambiguously influence money-income causality for each of the economies examined. This suggests that Asian monetary authorities should monitor US monetary policies carefully and decide upon the domestic money supply by reference to an EGARCH model. Alternatively, the domestic money supply may be determined by a rule based on the US money supply.

T2  - Increasing Management Relevance and Competitiveness
AB  - This study aims to identify and analyze the effect of monetary policy and macroeconomic variables on foreign portfolio investment in Indonesia. Liberalization and the integration of world financial markets encourages the movement of capital between countries, one of them in the form of portfolio investment. Foreign portfolio investment in Indonesia has a high volatility, which, in turn, may have negative consequences for the stability of the domestic financial market, so it needs to be analyzed in order to establish the determinants of the movements of foreign portfolio investment. This study used time series data from July 2005 to December 2015. The variables used consist of external variables (push factor) and domestic variables (pull factor) and the analytical method used is Structural VAR (Vector Auto Regression). The results showed that foreign portfolio investment responds significantly to changes in the federal funds rate and the Bank Indonesia rate, while, on the other hand, foreign portfolio investments respond, but not significantly, to changes in the real effective exchange rate, the Industrial Production Index, the Composite Stock Price Index, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average. Results of the forecast error variance decomposition state that the federal funds rate gives the largest contribution of the external variables (push factor) to changes in foreign portfolio investments in Indonesia.

TI  - The credit channel of monetary policy: Case of Austria
AU  - Krylova, Elizaveta
AB  - The legal environment, the structure of the financial system as well as the concentration of corporate ownership and the development of the capital market suggest for Austria a high effectiveness of the monetary policy with a strong impact of the lending channel. This supposition was verified combining three supplementary empirical methods: Granger causality between the velocities of money and loans and the real output; impulse-response functions for VECs with the subsequently opened/closed money/credit channels; the predictive power of money and loan variables for a production forecast. Both various types of loans and the total volume of credits for separate banking groups were examined. The Austrian output showed to be highly sensitive to monetary policy innovations; both the money and the credit channel were significant. The dependence of Austrian firms on credits rather than on other financial resources was more pronounced for credits in domestic currency, mortgage loans and municipal notes.

Therefore, we employ a detailed high frequency panel data in which we include bank characteristics and ownership control. We contribute to the literature on bank lending channel by showing that during periods of loosening/tightening monetary policy, banks increase/decrease their loans. Additionally,our results illustrate that large, well-capitalized and liquid banks react differentially to the effects of monetary policy shocks. Finally, we show that the impact of monetary policy differs across state-owned, foreign and private domestic banks. These results are important for developing and conducting monetary policy.

AB  - This paper proposes output gap dispersion as a measure of economic synchronization patterns across the world economies. Utilizing a novel, multivariate quantile causality testing methodology and data from a set of 45 advanced and emerging nations, we present evidence of significant causal effects of U.S. monetary policy measures over synchronization patterns across the advanced and emerging economy business cycles, even after controlling for various risk and uncertainty proxies. While U.S. monetary policy actions cause significant interdependence in business cycles across advanced economies, we find that the Fed’s policy decisions also contribute to uncertainty in industrial output patterns. U.S. monetary policy actions are also found to have significant causal effects on the dispersion of emerging market output gaps at low quantiles, suggesting that policy actions by the U.S. Fed drive synchronized economic activity across emerging nations. The findings have significant implications, particularly for policy makers in emerging economies, when it comes to the coordination of their domestic as well as regional monetary policies in response to monetary policy shocks from the U.S.

AB  - ‘Capitalism without failure is like religion without sin’. Charles Kindleberger's book Manias, Panics and Crashes points out that speculation and crises have always been present: the world economic crisis of the 20th century, the South Sea bubble in the 18th century, and the tulip mania in the first part of the 17th century. Starting with the Japanese bubble in the 1980s we take the reader on a tour through 20 years of bubbles in emerging markets and industrial countries which have recently culminated in the 2007/08 US subprime market crisis. We explain the global stock market and real estate booms based on the real and monetary overinvestment theories of Hayek, Wicksell and Schumpeter, arguing that ample liquidity supply originating in the large industrialised countries has contributed – independent from the exchange rate regime – to overinvestment cycles in new and emerging markets around the globe. The policy implication is to keep interest rates not too low for too long in response to bursting bubbles.
