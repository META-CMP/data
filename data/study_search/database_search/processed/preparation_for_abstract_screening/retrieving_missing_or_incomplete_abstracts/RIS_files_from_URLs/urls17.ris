AB  - The study empirically investigates the impact of monetary policy shocks on the performance of the industrial sector in Nigeria, and how this affect the general growth performance of the economy in the periods 1980-2018. Monetary policy variables used were money supply (M2t), monetary policy rate (Mprt), Treasury bill rate (Tbrt) and Credit to the private real sector (Credt). We also gauged the system with other control variables like gross fixed capital formation (gcft), inflation (�t) and exchange rate (exr). Utilizing Vector Autoregression (VAR) and Generalized Method of Moments (GMM), we found that any unanticipated shock on monetary policy rate and money supply growth will produce falling impact on industrial sector output that is consistent with no sign of convergence throughout the period. However, shocks to credit supply and treasury bill rate produces positive growth outliers at different magnitudes in the industrial sector. We also found statistically significant pass-through effect of monetary policy from the industrial sector to the general economy of at least 30 percent growth effect. A number of possible policy menu capable of deepening monetary policy-industrial performance nexus in Nigeria in years following the study have been prescribed in the studyincluding improved stock market development, bond market development and other credit channels that easily linked policy to the private sector for seamless policy transmission.

TI  - Monetary policy shocks and the dynamics of agricultural commodity prices: evidence from structural and factor-augmented VAR analyses
AU  - Alam, Md Rafayet

T2  - Agricultural Economics
AB  - Fluctuation in commodity prices is a significant and timely issue to be studied. This study is to examine the impact of monetary policy and other macroeconomic shocks on the dynamics of agricultural commodity prices. The major contributions of this study are twofold. First, unlike other studies that use indexes, this study analyzes the commodities individually, affording the inclusion of commodity-specific fundamentals such as the level of inventory—an important determinant of commodity price—in a structural VAR framework. Second, it exploits a rich data set of agricultural commodity prices which includes commodities that are usually overlooked in the literature, and extracts a common factor using the dynamic factor model to understand the extent of comovement of the prices and to gauge the extent to which macroeconomic shocks drive the “comovement” in a factor-augmented VAR (FAVAR) framework. The findings show that monetary policy, global economic conditions, and the U.S. dollar exchange rates play an important role in the dynamics of agricultural commodity prices.

AB  - Among Keynes’s undeveloped, or underground, ideas that are being resurrected in a new guise are those of the ‘monetary theory of production’ (1933) and firms’ ‘finance motive’ in the demand for money (1937). With variable acknowledgement and faithfulness, these ideas are detectable in the modern macroeconomics of imperfect capital markets.

T2  - Oxford Bulletin of Economics and Statistics
AB  - Monetary policy reaction functions are estimated for the UK over three periods – 1985–90, 1992–97 and 1997–2003 – in order to disentangle two effects: the switch from an emphasis on exchange rate stabilization to inflation targeting, and the introduction of instrument-independence in 1997. The external factors considered include US as well as German interest rates, and this leads to the identification of ‘domestic’ and ‘international’ models of the reaction function. The results suggest that it is the changes in the institutional arrangements rather than those in the targeting regime which have been decisive in the development of policy in this period.

T2  - Journal of Macroeconomics
AB  - Nonborrowed reserve mix as a measure of monetary policy is found to dominate the federal funds rate and nonborrowed reserves in terms of forecasting power for real activity in samples starting in 1959 with a moving endpoint from 1975:8 to 1997:8. In contrast, variance-decomposition results from moving samples of fixed length, that is from a rolling VAR, do not lead to the same conclusion. When data is excluded from the early and mid 1960s, the federal funds rate starts to provide more information concerning future movement in real activity relative to that provided by nonborrowed reserve mix. Results are determined from well established VAR models in which each variable in turn is identified as monetary policy indicator.

TI  - Oil Price Shocks and Monetary Policy in a Data-Rich Environment
AU  - Aastveit, Knut Are
AB  - This paper examines the impact of different types of oil price shocks on the U.S. economy, using a factor-augmented VAR (FAVAR) approach. The results indicate that when examining the effects of oil price shocks, it is important to account for the interaction between the oil market and the macroeconomy. I find that oil demand shocks are more important than oil supply shocks in driving several macroeconomic variables, and that the origin of demand shocks matter. Specifically, the U.S. economy and monetary policy respond differently to global demand shocks that have the effect of raising the price of oil and to oil-specific demand shocks.

AB  - With rare exception, studies of monetary policy tend to neglect the timing of innovations to monetary policy instruments. Models which take timing seriously are often difficult to compare to standard monetary VARs because each uses different frequencies. We propose using MIDAS regressions that nests both ideas: Accurate (daily) timing of innovations to policy are embedded in a monthly-frequency VAR to determine the macroeconomic effects of high-frequency policy shocks. We find that policy have greatest effects on variables thought of as heavily expectations oriented and that, contrary to some VAR studies, the effects of policy shocks on real variables are small.

TI  - Impacts of Exchange Rate Volatility on Macroeconomic and Financial Variables: Empirical Evidence from PVAR Modeling
AU  - Ozcelebi, Oguzhan
AB  - In this study, Panel Vector Autoregression (PVAR) models are used to determine the impacts of exchange rate volatility on industrial production growth rate, consumer price inflation, short-term interest rates and stock returns for 10 OECD countries. The variance decompositions (VDCs) found that exchange rate volatility can be a secondary factor for the variations in immediate interest rates, implying that Uncovered Interest Rate Parity (UIP) condition should be analyzed by the inclusion of other macroeconomic variables. Impulse response functions (IRFs) expose that volatility in exchange rates can have a positive impact on the liquidity conditions in money market and an increase in real economic activity because investors have to move their money away from currency markets to money markets. The relatively lower impact of exchange rate volatility may arise from the zero bound problem, thus it is emphasized that the examination of impacts on exchange rate volatility on macroeconomics variables should be made both considering conventional and unconventional monetary policy. Although impulse response functions (IRFs) did not detect the significant impact of exchange rate volatility on inflation, VDCs obtained supporting results to exchange rate pass-through (ERPT). I suggest that the monetary policy to be developed should clarify alternative channels that exchange rate may affect inflation.

TI  - Effectiveness of Monetary Policy in the Euro Area: The Role of US Economic Policy Uncertainty
AU  - Balcilar, Mehmet
AU  - Demirer, Riza
AU  - Gupta, Rangan
AU  - van Eyden, Renee
AB  - This paper examines the role of U.S. economic policy uncertainty on the effectiveness of monetary policy in the Euro area. Using a structural Interacted Vector Autoregressive (IVAR) model conditional on high and low levels of U.S. economic policy uncertainty, we find that uncertainty regarding policy changes in the U.S. dampens the effect of monetary policy shocks in the Euro area, with both price and output reacting more significantly to monetary policy shocks when the level of U.S. policy uncertainty is low. We argue that the U.S. government's actions regarding policy changes in the U.S. is a source of uncertainty for Euro area investors and high levels of policy uncertainty that spill over from the U.S. drive Euro area investors to adopt a wait-and-see approach, leading to a relatively weaker (and sometimes insignificant) response of price and output to monetary tightening in the Euro area. The findings underscore the importance of market integration and coordination of economic policy changes on the effectiveness of monetary policy on the macroeconomy on both sides of the Atlantic. Our results thus, provide evidence in favour of the policy ineffectiveness hypothesis in the Euro area contingent on the economic policy uncertainty of the U.S.

T2  - Journal of International Financial Markets, Institutions and Money
AB  - In Korea's high-growth economy, the Bank of Korea had been willing to tolerate double-digit inflation, provided that it remained at `non-explosive' levels. In this article, we estimate a monetary policy feedback rule for Korea and find that the upper threshold of tolerable inflation for the Bank of Korea was about 20%. It appears that the Bank of Korea's disciplined, rule-like approach to monetary policy was able to control inflation and keep it away from explosive levels, despite the well-known empirical regularity that inflation becomes more variable at higher levels. After 1983, however, our regime-switching model suggests that the inflation target has been 6%. We also find little evidence that the Bank of Korea has targeted real growth, except for a period in the mid-1980s when industrial production growth suggested that the economy was overheating, relative to an implicit growth target of 7.4%. We conclude with a discussion of possible reasons for Korea to choose to stabilize inflation at lower levels since the mid-1980s.

TI  - Turkey could loosen monetary policy prematurely
T2  - Emerald Expert Briefings
AB  - Significance Having partly restored its inflation-fighting credibility by maintaining an exceptionally tight monetary stance since its decision last September to raise its benchmark rate to a punitive 24%, the TCMB has been under pressure to signal the start of a rate-cutting cycle as the economy slides towards recession. However, while sentiment towards Turkey has improved dramatically, the scale of the erosion of the TCMB’s credibility over the past several years could make a premature rate cut extremely costly. ImpactsInflation is decelerating, the month-on-month CPI rate slowing to 0.2% in February, but the annual rate is still in double digits at 19.7%.The squeeze on consumption continues, with imports 27.2% down in January year-on-year, after a 28.3% fall in December.Industrial production, a proxy for GDP, has contracted for four successive months at an accelerating rate (9.8% year-on-year in December).

AB  - Stock and bond prices plummeted in early 1994. These losses occurred while the Fed was raising interest rates. Campbell (1995) argues that the Fed could have triggered the losses either by increasing the risk premium associated with monetary policy uncertainty or by communicating information about incipient inflation. This paper uses a multi-factor model to choose between these two hypotheses. The evidence indicates that both greater monetary policy uncertainty and especially news about inflation explain the asset price declines of 1994.

TI  - Interaction Between Monetary Policy and Exchange Rate Stabilization Policy in Bangladesh: A Joint Analysis Using Svar Model
AU  - Khan, M. Muzahidul Anam
AU  - Rahman, A. K. M. Atiqur
T2  - The Journal of Developing Areas
AB  - Bangladesh Bank, the central Bank of Bangladesh is committed to maintain price stability and facilitate economic growth through conventional monetary policy. Although Bangladesh entered the regime of floating exchange rate in 2003, central bank intervenes to minimize excessive fluctuation in exchange rate through foreign exchange intervention policy. While these two policies work simultaneously, there was no study to examine the performance and effectiveness of these policies and understand their interaction in the framework of a joint analysis. The paper intends to fill up this gap. The paper develops a structural vector autoregression (SVAR) model to understand how foreign exchange intervention and conventional monetary policy affects the economy along with the endogenous reaction of policy variables. The intervention policy and conventional monetary policy are jointly analyzed to understand the interaction between them and also their impact on exchange rate and other economic variables i.e., price levels, real economic activity and real financial asset prices. The SVAR model is identified through relevant exclusion restriction based on the literature and the reality of the economy of Bangladesh. Monthly data of the relevant variables from July 2003 to December 2014 are used to estimate the model. Impulse response function is used to reveal the impact of policy and other shocks.Results reveal that foreign exchange intervention shocks have significant effects on the Taka / US $ exchange rate and the contribution of foreign exchange intervention shocks to exchange rate fluctuation is larger than that of monetary policy shocks. However, intervention shock has virtually no impact on price level, economic activity and real asset price supporting sterilization. On the other hand, while conventional monetary policy has insignificant effect on relevant variables when its effect is examined excluding foreign exchange intervention policy, it has mostly significant impact on economic variables when joint analysis is conducted. Both monetary policy variable and foreign exchange intervention variable react to each other significantly, suggesting the usefulness of this joint analysis. Results also reveal appropriate policy reaction to economic situation. Central Bank’s policy interventions are working pretty well in achieving internal and external stability of the value of local currency. Hence, present framework of exchange rate intervention and monetary policy may be continued without any major overhaul. However, monetary policy has limited impact on economic activity measured by industrial production. Hence, to the extent growth is adversely affected by inflation and exchange rate fluctuation, the central bank may work towards achieving higher growth indirectly by maintaining low inflation and exchange rate stability.

Expected fluctations in the exchange rate, for the first time examined, are of major importance especially for stocks of raw materials which are mostly imported. Being strongly affected by monetary variables, inventory investment can play a major role as a transmission channel of monetary policy changes to the Greek economy.

Moreover, it was unaffected during a later period of the ZLB/negative policy rates, suggesting that monetary policy remained effective at all horizons then.

AB  - Purpose: Nowadays, the changes in the level of economic activities in the housing market are
accepted as the most important signal of macroeconomic performance. This situation brings
about the need to give importance to the investigation of policy implementations that affect
economic activity in the housing market. So, this study aims to find out the effects of changes
in the monetary policy on housing prices in Turkey as a sample of developing country.
Design/methodology/approach: This study employed Augmented Vector Autoregression
(VAR) analysis. For housing prices; the Housing Unit price series, calculated by the Central
Bank, spanning 2010M1-2016M3 are used. Housing unit price is calculated by Housing price
per square meter. To represent production volume, the index of total industrial production has
been used. To represent inflation series, CPU (Consumer Price Index) series have been used.
The data has been taken from CBRT (the Central Bank of the Republic of Turkey) and TUIK
(Turkish Statistical Institute).
Findings: Results show that policy interest rates are important indicators for the related term’s
housing prices and it can also be said that the housing price channel has partially been effective.
Accordingly, results determined that monetary policy had a significant effect on housing prices
in Turkish housing market.
Originality/value: This study supports the argument that monetary policy has a significant
effect on housing prices in developing countries like Turkey.

TI  - Will EMU Generate Asymmetry? Comparing Monetary Policy Transmission Across European Countries
AU  - Ehrmann, Michael
AB  - This paper re-evaluates the estimation of monetary policy transmission. Within the Structural VAR framework, five methodological points are identified, recognition of which can help to improve the reliability and credibility of estimates. The findings of the methodological analysis are then applied to the estimation of models for thirteen European countries. Results show that considerable differences in the transmission mechanism exist between these economies, mainly in intensity, but also in timing.

TI  - Monetary policy and industrial investment: A review of few studies
AB  - Ever since its establishment in 1999, the European Central Bank worked on maintaining relative price stability mainly through inflation targeting. The ECB aims at a target inflation rate below but close to 2%. However, the diversity among the member states in the European Union and the Eurozone requires not only collective attention on the EU economy but also on each individual member state. Some Eurozone member states experience generally higher levels of inflation and higher unemployment. On the other side are countries like Germany which are more concerned with maintaining low inflation only. Many economists and politicians criticize the ECB for its monetary decision-making, which affects various member states differently and could drive their economies out of alignment (Salvatore, 2002).

The literature on the topic suggests a theory also known as the German Dominance Hypothesis (GDH), which explains the prevailing role of Germany and German's economic objectives on the ECB decision-making process. The main purpose of this paper is to study the reasoning behind this commonly spread criticism of the European Central bank and test if the ECB's monetary policy is beneficial for the Eurozone members as a whole or only for a select group of countries, which have similar economic profiles. Or in other words, the paper establishes the differential impact of the ECB monetary policies on the Eurozone member states with the expectations that the policy will benefit mostly the German economy and other economies with similar low-inflation targeting needs and will negatively impact others, which face high unemployment rates, in general.

TI  - The impact of monetary policy on the credit activity in the Slovak Republic
AU  - Urbanovi, Ing Michaela
AB  - This article focuses on the monetary policy of the National Bank of Slovakia and its development after the Slovak Republic joined the European Monetary Union. The aim is to analyze the impact of current monetary policy of the European Central Bank implemented through the national central banks on the credit activity in Slovakia and to forecast its future development using the Autoregressive Moving Average method. In order to prove the statistical significance of the monetary policy effect on the credit activity represented by the overall volume of credits, the linear regression was applied. We have shown that the amount of granted credits depends on the interest rate on marginal lending facilities, the interest rate on deposit facilities, the monetary aggregate M3 and the deposits in the National Bank of Slovakia.

AU  - Nyawo, Seabelo T.
AU  - Van Wyk, Roscoe Bertrum
AB  - This paper investigates the effects of a US economic policy uncertainty shock on Indian macroeconomic variables with a number of Structural VARs. This study models the economic policy uncertainty index as constructed by Baker et al. (2013). The study also uses a set of macroeconomic variables for India such as inflation, industrial production and nominal interest rate. The objective of the study is to identify the potential impacts of economic policy uncertainty shocks from the US economy to the Indian economy. According to the SVARs, a one standard deviation shock to the US economic policy uncertainty leads to a statistically significant decline in the Indian industrial production of -0.294% and in the Indian inflation of -0.032%. India shows to be resistant to US policy uncertainty. Furthermore, the study finds that the contribution of the US economic policy uncertainty on the Indian macroeconomic variables is shown to be significantly larger than the one exerted by the Indian uncertainty shock.

We establish stylized facts and study their stability during the global financial crisis and the European sovereign debt crisis. Long-term interest rates have been exceptionally high and long-term loans and deposits exceptionally low since the Lehman collapse. Instead, short-term interest rates and short-term loans and deposits did not show abnormal dynamics in the course of the financial and sovereign debt crisis.

T2  - Applied Economics
AB  - This article uses a structural vector autoregression approach to analyse the impact of financial stress on the economy and the relationship between monetary policy and financial stress in the ASEAN-5 economies (Indonesia, Malaysia, Philippines, Singapore and Thailand). We find that an increase in financial stress leads to tighter credit conditions and lower economic activity in all five countries. The estimated impact on the real economy displays an initial rapid decline followed by a gradual dissipation. In Malaysia, the Philippines and Thailand, the central banks tend to reduce policy interest rates (IRs) when financial stress increases, although there is substantial cross-country variation in the magnitude and time dynamics. The lower policy IRs are found to have little significant effects in lowering financial stress, but are still effective in stimulating economic activity through other channels. These findings imply that easing monetary policy is likely necessary but insufficient to address growth slowdowns associated with financial stress. Monetary easing should instead be complemented with other policy measures which are targeted at restoring financial stress to normal levels.

TI  - Measuring Monetary Policy in Emerging Market Countries: The Case Turkey
AU  - Terzibas, Nilgun
AB  - This paper aims to measure monetary policy in emerging market economies with a vector autoregression (VAR) approach. The model for small open economies of Cushman and Zha (1995) is followed, as emerging economies - in particular Turkey - are typical small open economies. The model is adjusted by considering a special characteristic of emerging market countries, namely high inﬂation. This leads often to substantial rise in the use of foreign currency in inland as in particular for deposits. Interest rates for foreign-currency-denominated deposits or loans gain an important role within the macroeconomics of these countries. As aconsequence, the foreign-denominated interest rate is added into the model presented in this paper. In consideration of this aspect the resulting dynamic of the modiﬁed model should give additional information about the eﬀects of monetary policy shock as well as of foreign shock.

TI  - Was monetary policy impotent or simply contracyclical in the 1980s?
AU  - Tanner, J. Ernest
AU  - Pescatrice, Donn
T2  - Journal of Macroeconomics
AB  - Historically, there was always a close and quite stable relationship between the monetary aggregates and economic activity. But, in the early 1980s, the linkage between money growth and U.S. economic activity appeared to have broken down. No longer were movements in money quickly reflected in the real economy. Much of the recent research contends that the traditional monetary relationships have degenerated. However, it is argued that the evidence from the 1980s is not inconsistent with the traditional monetarist money-to-output relationship and the power of money supply changes. Rather, the apparent failure of monetarism and monetary policy in the 1980s was the direct result of its successful application. In contrast to earlier periods when Federal Reserve policies were too often procyclical, recent Fed policies seem more enlightened and appear to have been significantly more contracyclical. Hence, the conventional tests have shown little correlation between money growth and non-financial economic activity.

TI  - The effects of monetary policy shocks on bank loans
AU  - Özçelikkale, Kaan
AB  - This thesis examines the effects of monetary policy shocks on bank loans. I use a vector autoregression (VAR) model with external instrument identification, which is constructed using high-frequency analysis. Gertler and Karadi (2015) methodology is followed. I also consider the information effects and employ the surprises, which are measured by Miranda-Agrippino and Ricco (2021). I find that contractionary monetary policy shocks have significant negative effects on bank loans. The commercial loans growth statistically significantly drops both immediately after the contractionary monetary policy shock and a year after the shock. On the other hand, the consumer and real estate loans growths modestly decrease but it is not statistically significant. Since some of the findings indicate a statistically insignificant decrease in the growth, I also check the response of the credit stocks. There are significant drops in all the credit stocks at least for some periods. Lastly, I show that the findings are robust to the sample period, adding a new variable and the policy indicator. All the findings are consistent with the theory and literature.

TI  - Effects of Monetary Policy Shocks on Inequality: A Proxy-Svar Approach
AU  - N. Mertens, Arnaud
AB  - Inequality has been increasing in the United States over the past three decades. While several avenues have been explored to explain this rise, the role of monetary policy has only recently been considered. Moreover, the overall effects of monetary policy shocks on inequality remain ambiguous both theoretically and empirically. Therefore, I propose a new study of the effects of conventional monetary policy shocks on income inequality in the United States. To do so, I use a structural vector autoregression (SVAR) model with external instruments. It consists of taking series of monetary policy shocks as proxies for structural shocks. First, I provide evidence that contractionary monetary policy shocks significantly increase inequality in the long run. Second, by breaking the income distribution down into different groups, I show that the higher an income group in the distribution is, the more favored it is by contractionary shocks. Third, I find that the increase in income of the top 1% is strikingly symmetric to the decrease of the bottom 10% after a contractionary monetary policy shock. These findings suggest that the Fed’s actions play a role in long-term inequality.

distributed lag (ARDL) model due to its appropriateness for small sample. Bond test result indicates that there is long run relationship among Islamic bank
loans and its determinant and also conventional bank and its determinant at 1% significance level. Nevertheless, result from this study illustrates that there is
significant negative impact of interest rate on Islamic bank loans in short run and although it is not significant in the long run. It also illustrates presence of
significant negative impact of interest rate on conventional bank loans in the short run while there is significant positive impact on conventional bank loans in
the long run. The outcome from this study led several policy implications; Firstly, overnight policy rate designed to influence day to day activities of financial
institutions is effective in performing its function as short term predictor. Secondly, since the result supported impact of interest rate on Islamic bank loans which
make necessary for the central bank to set up monetary policy that suits both banks while interest free banks needs to improve their risk management tools.

Our study follows Sims (1992) for recent decades that include the financial crisis of 2008. The Bank of England followed the Fed in taking an active role in managing the bank rate in the UK and employed quantitative easing during and post financial crisis in 2008. Our work isolates the structural shocks to the money supply and the bank rate. We examine the impulse responses of the bank rate, exchange rate, prices levels, and the industrial production deploying a structural vector autoregressive model (SVAR). The variance decomposition results and impulse responses from the VECM and SVAR models show that the industrial production is responsive to monetary actions of the Bank of England.

We explore the effects of interest and exchange rate transmission channels on the economy's response to the monetary shocks. We find that the impulse responses of output and prices to interest rate and exchange rate shocks follow predicted theoretical dynamics. We find the exchange rate channel has the largest impact on the real economy, while the interest rate channel has a limited role in transmitting monetary shocks to the economy. Future developments of monetary policy channels in Croatia are also discussed.

AB  - We examine the impact of monetary policy actions on the returns of investment companies. We observe that an expansionary monetary policy action increases the returns of investment companies, while a contractionary policy action depresses the returns. We observe that monetary policy actions have asymmetric effects on returns across different monetary policy environments. We observe that the response of the returns of investment companies to surprise federal funds target rate changes is large and statistically significant. Returns are statistically significantly affected by positive policy surprises (larger than expected value of the federal funds target rate) while they are not significantly affected by negative positive surprises. We observe that the effects of monetary policy on the investments companies are asymmetric across different business conditions and the results are robust to different identification schemes of the business conditions. We find evidence that the effect of monetary policy on the returns of investments companies in good business conditions is statistically significant compared to bad business conditions. Surprise monetary expansion is interpreted by investors as bad news in high levels of economic activity while it is interpreted as good news in low levels of economic activity. Furthermore, we find that the asymmetric effect of monetary policy across different business conditions are due to the asymmetric effect of monetary policy on the discount rates and expected cash flow proxies. Moreover, we find evidence that the effect of monetary policy on the returns of investments companies are driven by its effect through changes in discount rate proxies as opposed to expected cash flow proxies. The results imply that the monetary policy plays a strong signaling role for the stock market and that any asset-pricing model for investments companies should take into account the effect of monetary policy by incorporating an interest rate-based indicator of monetary policy in the model.

In the current conditions, it is extremely important to build a competent monetary policy in order to soften the "blows" caused by the global recession for national economies.<b>Purpose of the article:<b/> The main purpose of the presented article is the analysis of measures to stimulate the economy using monetary policy instruments in the conditions of the coronacrisis.<b>Methods:<b/> To conduct the study, we used official statistics data, on the basis of which an econometric model was built, which allowed us to determine the forecast values for inflation, taking into account the impact of monetary and non-monetary factors.<b>Findings & Value added:<b/> The econometric analysis show the high importance of non-monetary factors of inflation. This makes it difficult to assess the monetary policy, since Central banks are able to influence non-monetary factors only indirectly. The paper notes the influence of the refinancing rate on loans to the real sector of the economy, since the stabilization monetary policy should be primarily aimed at maintaining economic growth. The correlation field of the relationship between the index of rigidity of restrictions developed by the University of Oxford and loans to small and medium-sized businesses is constructed. It is noted that with the reduction of administrative restrictions, the volume of loans granted to small and medium-sized businesses increases.

TI  - The real interest rates across monetary policy regimes
AU  - Seoane, Hernán D.
AB  - This paper reviews the main theories of interest rate determination and studies the dynamics of the real interest rate in US. Using cointegration techniques we search for equilibrium relationships between the real interest rate, monetary factors and real factors and we study how these relationships change with the policy regimes. We analyze monthly US data since early 20th century and find equilibrium relationships between a measure of the real interest rate, the policy interest rate and industrial production growth only after the end of the Bretton Woods. Moreover, we find that the equilibrium relationships between these variables are not invariant to changes in the monetary policy regime.

AB  - We study nominal exchange rate dynamics in the aftermath of U.S. monetary policy announcements. Using high-frequency interest rate and stock price movements around FOMC announcements, we distinguish between pure monetary policy shocks and information shocks, which are associated with new information contained in the announcements. Contractionary pure policy shocks give rise to a strong, but transitory, appreciation on impact. Information shocks also appreciate the exchange rate, but the effect builds up only slowly over time and is highly persistent. Thus, we conclude that although the short-run effects on the exchange rate are primarily due to pure policy shocks, the medium-run response is driven by information effects.

TI  - SVAR Modeling of Inflation Response to Monetary Policy in Russia
AU  - Smirnov, Stepan
AU  - Tlostanov, Vladimir
AB  - The objective of this work was to assess the impact of the monetary policy of the central bank of the Russian Federation on the level of inflation using the structural autoregression model (SVAR). The results show significant inflation responses in the first months to different approximations of monetary policy. Thus, with an increase in the money supply (M2) by 1%, inflation in the first month increases by 0.23%, and with an increase in the interbank lending rate by the same amount, inflation increases by 0.125%. Inflation attenuation at the 90% level of significance occurs at 5 and 6 months, respectively. At the 95% level of significance, when the money supply changes, the inflation response dies out in the second month. When changing the interbank loan rate, the attenuation occurs in the fifth month.

AB  - This article attempts to determine whether controlling for the time-varying risk premium would improve the ability of the federal funds futures to predict the Federal Open Market Committee's (FOMC) decision regarding the direction and magnitude of changes in the federal funds target rate at different forecast horizons. This is done using an appropriate categorical dependent variable model, which is estimated using real-time monthly data covering the period from January 1994 through September 2008. Following Piazzesi and Swanson (2008), control is made for the risk premium using a number of business-cycle indicators including nonfarm payrolls, the industrial production index, the help wanted index, and a measure of the Treasury yield spread. The results indicate that accounting for the risk premium modestly improves the predictive performance of the futures rate for the longer forecast horizons. Moreover, such a control appears to alleviate the over-prediction of changes in the target rate by the futures rate that has been documented in the literature.

AB  - The purpose of this research is to analyze the transmission mechanism of monetary policy in a dual banking system, composed of both Islamic banks and Conventional banks, highlighting the factors that may influence behavior of Banks on the impact of monetary stimuli on their rates. In this context, an econometric model that examines the effectiveness of transmission of monetary policy in a dual banking system by advocating the hypothesis of asymmetric transmission of monetary policy was developed and tested. To answer the research problem, the adopted methodology is based on the Vectoriel Autoregressive (VAR) model, which is not only explanatory but also predictive.The different results obtained through the empirical investigation carried out are discussed by exposing their methodological and theoretical implications.

TI  - Estimating Monetary Policy Effects When Interest Rates are Bounded at Zero
AU  - Iwata, Shigeru

AB  - Using a nonlinear structural VAR approach, we estimate the effects of exogenous monetary impulses in the presence of a zero lower bound constraint on nominal interest rates and examine the impact of such a  constraint on the effectiveness of counter-cyclical monetary policies.  We find that a binding zero bound on nominal interest rates can eliminate more than 50% of the effect of an exogenous monetary impulse on output based on the data from Japan. The conditional impulse response functions allow us to isolate the effect of monetary shocks operating through the interest rate channel when other possible channels of monetary transmission are present. Moreover, we also find that the zero bound on nominal interest rates could severely limit the ability of central banks to pursue a counter-cyclical monetary policy when facing adverse macroeconomic shocks.

AU  - Sun, Wei

AB  - This article studies the interactions between the U.S. and China’s economies in an integrated structural VAR model. We incorporate seven variables representing both the U.S. and China’s economies and use both short-run and long-run restrictions to identify the structural shocks and examine impacts of these shocks on outputs, prices, and monetary policies of the two countries. Using monthly data from 2000:1 to 2015:6, we find that China’s business cycles have become increasingly synchronized with the U.S. economy and China’s monetary policy coordinated with that of the United States, since China’s output, consumer price, and monetary policy all respond in a symmetric way to the U.S. macroeconomic shocks, but the same is not found for the United States to China’s. However, we do find that China exerts influence on the U.S. consumer price. Our results have important policy implications regarding the bilateral economic relations between China and the United States.

AU  - Tober, Silke

AB  - In a small structural model we find asymmetries in the effects of monetary policy in Germany depending on whether the economy is in an upswing or a downswing. These two different regimes are also identified using a Markov-switching model and the Kalman filter. Our results indicate that the effects of monetary policy are significantly higher in a downswing than in an upswing. It follows not only that monetary policy has to raise interest rates markedly if an economy is overheating but also that once a downturn is discernible, interest rates have to be lowered rapidly so as to prevent an overly large reaction of the real economy.

AB  - Over the past 20 years, macroeconomic performance has improved in industrialised and developing countries alike. In a broad cross‐section of countries inflation volatility has fallen markedly while output variability has either fallen or risen only slightly. This increased stability can be attributed to some combination of more efficient monetary policy making, a reduction in the variability of supply shocks, and changes in the structure of the economy. We develop a method for allocating performance changes among these factors. For 21 of the 24 countries we study, more efficient monetary policy has been the driving force behind improved performance.

TI  - THE MONETARY POLICY TRANSMISSION MECHANISM IN THE EMERGENT COUNTRIES, AN ANALYSIS BASED ON THE AUTOREGRESSIVE VECTOR.
AB  - The integration in the euro area implies a unique monetary policy for the countries from this area. The implementation of a restrictive monetary policy by ECB in order to counter-balance the inflationist pressures could compromise the real convergence process of the euro area new members, while a relaxed monetary policy, adopted to stimulate the economy, can lead to an overheating of the developing economies. Therefore, within this article we proposed to realize an evaluation of the monetary policy transmission channels in the countries from Central and Eastern Europe. For this reason we utilized a model based on the autoregressive vector methodology. From an economical point of view, our model underlines the heterogeneity of the monetary policy transmission mechanism within the four member states of the European Union, in future a homogenization of monetary policies being necessary. In default of a sustainable and efficient economic model, an early adoption of the single currency can create major dysfunctionalities for these countries. Thus, they will not be able to stimulate the economy through the interest rate or through the exchange rate, policies frequently utilized at present.

This research estimates a structural VAR model using monthly data from January 2000 to February 2016. The result suggests that the Malaysian ringgit and industrial production were mostly affected by the US financial market variables. In comparison, Malaysia's inflation rate was relatively less affected by this external shock as compared to oil price shocks. This shows that the Malaysian ringgit serves as the primary absorber of the external shocks. Given that Malaysia works under a flexible exchange rate system, when the economy experiences external shocks, the nominal exchange rate serves as a natural automatic shock absorber

Currently, the change of technological modes of civilization starts and thus becomes effective more different from previous periods of connections and interdependence. Given this, concluded that using of modern instruments of monetary policy (increase / decrease rates) will not promote the growth of labor productivity, increase investment in real economy and overcome unemployment and income differentiation as long until effortlessly confirmed production technologies, correspond to new technological mode and will not happen structural reconstruction of economy.Therefore, in our opinion, the most important task should be stimulation of scientific research large–scale implementation of new technologies; the consequence will be growth of labor productivity, which will increase on average level of interest rates that will create opportunities for effective monetary policy. In this way, the global financial market entered crisis period of cyclical system with a high degree crisis synchronization of national markets. Consequently, the impact of unconventional monetary policy instruments will be less predictable than usually and the global financial system is waiting for irreversible radical changes.

TI  - Heterogenous eﬀects of the monetary policy in the euro area: a factor-augmented VAR (FAVAR) approach
AU  - Gavilan-Rubio, Miguel Angel
AB  - This paper presents a quantitative assessment of the heterogeneous eﬀects that a common monetary policy shock exerts on diﬀerent economies in a euro area (EA). To that end, a FAVAR model is used to trace out the eﬀects of an increment of ECB’s intervention rate on industrial production, unemployment and harmonised prices in seven countries of the EA. The results show that the eﬀects of a contractionary monetary shock on the industry are homogenous across the selected countries, falling after the intervention - except for Greece. This is a result of the synchronisation of the industrial business cycle and common funding patterns in the sector. However, the unemployment responses are heterogeneous both in size and sign, suggesting that the lack of a common European regulatory framework for labour has prevented the integration of the labour markets in the EA, and a common framework would improve the synchronisation of the business cycles among the EA countries. Finally, the eﬀects on prices are heterogeneous in size but not in sign, showing a more moderate response than on production terms and even neutral for some countries.

AB  - In a world of certainty, the authorities know the exact effect of varying their control instruments (e.g., through monetary or fiscal policy actions) upon the various objectives of policy, such as full employment, stable prices, etc. Difficulties will be encountered, however, whenever there are more objectives than instruments. In such cases, not all objectives can be fully met and the most that can be done is to achieve the best possible compromise (or trade-off) between the various objectives. An alternative and apparently more attractive approach is to search for further (independent) instruments. But it is a common experience to find that the employment of another instrument can reveal a threat to some further objective. If demand management seems incapable of maintaining both a reasonable level of employment and price stability, the introduction of a prices and incomes policy to help in containing inflation may thus endanger, inter alia, the allocative function of the price mechanism.

AB  - The long end of the South African yield curve has remained sticky and high for quite some time now, despite a low interest rate environment. In this paper we analyse the role of ﬁscal policy and its debt maturity structure which is producing this "monetary contraction" through its effect on the long end of the yield curve. We consider National Treasury’s government bond switch auction programme and its impact on bond yields and the economy. We show that these switch auction announcements have resulted in increased yields and shocks to bond prices via increased modiﬁed duration or price sensitivity. Using these shocks to bond prices as an instrument for debt, we ﬁnd that the switches have also resulted in a contractionary effect on output and monetary policy.

AB  - This paper examines the implementation of monetary policy during the interest rates targeting in a small-open economy (i.e. Malaysia) by using an open-economy structural VAR (SVAR) study. It tests the effect of foreign shocks upon domestic macroeconomic fluctuations and monetary policy, and examines how effective monetary policy is in influencing macroeconomic variables. The results show that during interest rates targeting, monetary policy plays a significant role in affecting macroeconomics variables. This finding suggests that monetary policy has an important role as a stabilization policy in a small-open economy.

AB  - This paper examines the effects of exchange rate depreciation to the U.S. economy in a factor-augmented vector autoregression model using monthly data of 148 variables for the post–Bretton Woods period of 1973–2017. Exchange rate shock is identified to reflect exogenous disturbances to the foreign exchange market, and movements in exchange rate that are not accounted for by changes in the U.S. monetary policy. We find that depreciation is expansionary and inflationary to the broad U.S. economy, the current account improves over time conforming to the J-curve theory, and monetary policy is leaning against the wind.

AB  - This paper studies the role of the Federal Reserve's policy in the recent boom and bust of the housing market, and in the ensuing recession. By estimating a structural dynamic factor model on a panel of 109 US quarterly variables from 1982 to 2010, we find that, although the Federal Reserve's policy between 2002 and 2004 was slightly expansionary, its contribution to the recent housing cycle was negligible. We also show that a more restrictive policy would have smoothed the cycle but not prevented the recession. We thus find no role for the Federal Reserve in causing the recession.

T2  - PRAGATI : Journal of Indian Economy
AB  - In India, prior to 1991, the tightly controlled interest rates caused impediments in the functioning of the interest rate channel of monetary policy transmission while after 1991, the RBI undertook various measures to strengthen the market-determination of interest rates. This paper has examined the evolution of the interest channel in India across the period 1985 to 2014 firstly by studying the interest rate pass-through using the Correlation matrix and the OLS technique and secondly, by studying the transmission of policy rates to the real economy using the reduced VAR model. The results show that the transmission of interest rates pass-through from policy rates to market interest rates (both - short-term as well as long-term) has strengthened while desired impact of long term market interest rates on industrial production and inflation appears to be weak.

TI  - Asymmetric Effects of Monetary Policy: Evidence from Turkey
AU  - Akçaglayan, Anil
AB  - ABSTRACT The aim of this paper is to investigate the asymmetric effects of unanticipated interest rate shocks on real production and inflation in Turkey from 2003:01 to 2019:09 by means of non-linear autoregressive distributed lag (NARDL) model. For that purpose, assuming that the interest rate is determined by means of the Taylor rule, the changes in interest rate were decomposed into anticipated and surprise components. NARDL enables us to observe the asymmetric effects of monetary policy in terms of the size of shocks and the stance of the shocks. The findings of this study support the idea that, in Turkey, while unanticipated monetary policy shocks have symmetric effects on production, their effects on inflation are asymmetric. Regarding the direction of the policy, positive and negative interest rate changes exert a significant positive effect on inflation. Regarding the size of monetary policy, only big shocks have a considerable effect on inflation. Augmented central bank reaction function with asymmetric relationship might enrich information for policymakers and improve the effectiveness of monetary policy.

AB  - For many years after their independence the trade policies of the South Asian countries were inward-looking and highly interventionist.1 Trade liberalization started in Sri Lanka during 1977 with a sharp devaluation and a series of sweeping trade policy reforms. Gradual reform got under way in the rest of South Asia about 10 years later during the second half of the 1980s, and continued into the 1990s. During this period most QRs were removed, tariffs reduced and exchange rate regimes liberalized. In India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka and Nepal this process continued from the second half of the 1990s and during the first five or so years of the 2000s, albeit unevenly and with backtracking episodes along the way. In Bangladesh, however, a major reversal of its earlier trade liberalization started in 1997 and continued during the first decade of the 2000s.

AB  - This paper estimates two widely used approaches to identify the differential impacts that monetary policy has on the labor market outcomes of teenagers, minorities, out-of-school youth, and less-skilled individuals. Evidence from recursive VARs and ADL models that use information on disinflationary initiatives by the Federal Reserve indicate that the employment-population ratio of minorities is more sensitive to disinflationary mo netary policy than whites, primarily falling due to an increase in unemployment and not a decline in labor force participation. Teenagers are found to disproportionately bear the brunt of disinflationary monetary policy, particularly African American teenagers. Young out-of-school less educated men and women bear the largest costs of disinflationary monetary policies. Their employment-population ratios fall due to increased difficulty in obtaining employment.

TI  - An analysis of Eurozone’s low inflation : has the ECB’s monetary policy response to disinflationary pressures been effective?
AU  - Giordimaina, Paul
AB  - Since 2008, the Euro Area has been faced with a number of episodes which threatened its price stability. The European Central Bank (ECB) has been involved in a continuous fight against the low inflation environment which came to develop over these recent years, by implementing a series of unconventional monetary policy measures which prior to this period have been unprecedented in both size and scope. The aim of this dissertation is to analyse what has been causing Eurozone’s prolonged period of low inflation and whether the ECB monetary policy has been effective in tackling these disinflationary pressures. In this regard, the objective of this study is to test the hypothesis that the implementation of unconventional monetary policy measures by the ECB have had a positive effect on output and inflation.
To test this hypothesis, a vector autoregressive (VAR) model capturing monthly data over a sample covering the period from January 2007 to December 2016 is employed. The model includes five variables: inflation rate, ECB balance sheet total assets, industrial production, volatility index, and one moth forward crude oil prices.
The results show that the ECB monetary policy’s response to disinflationary pressures has not been effective. This conclusion was not indifferent to conclusions reached by other authors within the relevant literature. To substantiate this conclusion, an extensive discussion of the results provides a comprehensive rationalisation for these findings.

AB  - The focus of this paper is the effect of the Plaza Agreement in September, 1985 on domestic monetary policies in Germany, Japan, United Kingdom, and United States. Monetary policy became much more expansionary in three of the four countries, the exception being Germany. Efforts by Japan and the United Kingdom to limit dollar depreciation spread U.S. expansion to these other two countries, inducing a classic cycle in interest rates, economic activity, and inflation. Analysis of daily exchange rates and interest rates suggests that market participants did not understand the expansionary implications of the Plaza agreement and subsequent policy actions.

AB  - Indonesia is the largest Muslim country with a unique monetary system that in its development tries to juxtapose two monetary systems that have different philosophies and still need to be deepened on the extent of their impact and effectiveness on the economy. The study explores the impact of macro indicators and monetary policy instruments on economic output in Indonesia. Using the time series analysis method with the Vector Error Correction Model (VECM) approach, the model shows the results that the Macro Capital Market or Stock Market indicators have a positive impact on the economy both in the short and long term. At the same time, inflation responds positively to short-term behavior but becomes economic constraints in long-term action. Meanwhile, in the Monetary policy instruments’ scope, the M1 variable consistently has positive implications both in the short and long term. In contrast, the M2 and SBIS variables give negative responses in the short time but become a driving force for the economy in the long term. Meanwhile, there is no positive correlation between Sharia, Monetary Operations with Economic Output. The research suggests focusing on innovating sharia monetary policy instruments by continuing to carry out monetary policy reforms in order to stimulate better economic conditions.

TI  - The Channel of Monetary Transmission to Demand: Evidence from the Market for Automobile Credit
AU  - Ludvigson, Sydney
T2  - Journal of Money, Credit and Banking
AB  - In response to tight money, both consumer loans and consumption fall. I ask whether there is any causality running from loans to consumption by focussing on how the composition of automobile finance between bank and nonbank sources of credit changes in response to unanticipated innovations in monetary policy. The results indicate that contractionary monetary policy produces a statistically significant reduction in the relative supply of bank consumer loans, which in turn produces a decline in real consumption. The evidence therefore supports the existence of a credit channel of monetary transmission to aggregate consumption. Moreover, the nature of automobile finance is uniquely suited to identifying which of two possible subchannels of the broader credit channel is relatively more important, and suggests the results are more likely consistent with a bank lending channel than with a pure balance sheet channel. However, the findings also indicate that the quantitative effects of the lending channel on the aggregate economy, though precisely estimated, may be quite small.

(2010); Nakajima, Kasuya, and Watanabe (2011); Nakajima (2011) and among others have studied about how time-varying parameter Bayesian VAR can capture the movement of zero bound interest rate and is able to model the behavior of monetary policies in Japan. In our study we aim to capture the shocks by setting both short-term and long-term interest rate to very close to zero. By treating this crucial monetary policy from Bank of Japan as ”unconventional monetary policy”, we apply TVP-Structural BVAR with sign restriction in structural impulse response matrix. The results show that for industrial production growth rate, this variable is responsive to short-term interest rate relative to long-term (BOJ’s discount rates). Despite that by using structural historical shock decompositions we found that during the past decades, the shocks from BOJ’s discount rate has steadily aﬀect to Japanese inﬂation.

TI  - Monetary Policy Transmission and Financial Stability in a LIC: The Case of Bangladesh
AU  - Rafiq, Mr Sohrab
AB  - This paper explores how monetary policy affects the real economy and its efficacy in promoting financial stability in a large low income country. This paper shows that monetary policy modestly impacts real economic activity and inflation via the bank lending and financial accelerator channels. Second, money market and treasury rates signal changes in the policy stance, while altering banks’ intermediation cost curves due to shifting risk premia. At the same time, evidence points to monetary policy inducing an overshooting in asset prices. These findings suggest that financial stability could be undermined if the calibration of monetary policy is based solely on output and inflation without accounting for the stage of the financial cycle. Finally, the paper discusses policy measures that would enhance the transmission of monetary policy and promote financial stability in Bangladesh.

It estimates an exchange-rate-augmented Taylor rule for India over the period Quarter 1 of 1980 to Quarter 4 of 2008. It investigates monetary policy changes between the pre- and post-liberalisation periods in order to capture the potential impact of macroeconomic structural changes on the RBI'S monetary policy conduct. Overall, if finds that the output gap seems to matter more to RBI than inflation, there is greater sensitivity to consumer price inflation, exchange rate changes do not constitute an important policy factor, and the post-1998 conduct of monetary policy seems to have changed in the direction of less inertia.

One is the Fed's desire to hit its money growth targets, the other is to carry out a counter-cyclical short-run monetary policy. Both motives are found to be significant during the period. This evidence is consistent with the contention of some economists that the period was not a valid test of monetarist policy rules.

AU  - Chua, Chia Yei
AU  - Nan, Zhen Sheng
AB  - The 2007 US subprime crisis had demonstrated that the impact of the housing market could be far-reaching. Most significantly, the catastrophe demonstrated that the housing sector forms an integral part of an economy and could definitely affect the economy drastically. In this paper, we investigate whether the monetary policy provides a means to remedy these variations in the housing market. This paper wishes to focus on the immediate East Asia region and, thus, finds that South Korea provides the most complete data set. Hence, it is chosen as the representative country to examine the housing market and monetary policy interactions. Data on the industrial production index, consumer price index, deposit rates and housing market prices are collected for the post-Asian financial crisis period to pre-US subprime crisis period. A Vector Error-Correction model is estimated to model the data. Then, the corresponding structural form is utilized to compute the Impulse Response Function following an interest rate shock. The Forecast Error Variance Decompositions of the different factors are also provided as supplementary evidence. Our results demonstrate that, indeed, monetary policy does offer a mean to rectify instabilities in the housing market. Furthermore, its effect are relatively short-term and has limited effect on output, these add to the appeal of using it as an adjustment policy.

This is important as central bankers have widened the range of instruments in their monetary policy toolbox. Specifically, we estimate a proxy for the monetary policy stance and then analyse a time-varying parameter vector autoregressive with stochastic volatility model to explain the BoE’s trade-offs when making policy decisions and as well as to demonstrate dynamic impacts of monetary policy on inflation and economic growth. The empirical results show that our estimated monetary policy proxy is better at capturing the BoE’s policy when the interest rate lower bound becomes binding.

However, irregular factors such as bridging days may impede the analysts perform the most accurate seasonal adjustment and lead to wrong adjusted values. In this study we aim to identify the impact of bridging days on Industrial Production Index (IPI) in Turkey by also taking into account the time of the year the bridging days fall. The results show that while national holiday bridging days do not affect IPI, religious holiday bridging days do. However, the magnitude of impact changes according to the season of the year. The production loss impact during a religious holiday in the high season (June -October) is around 40 percent, it is reduced by half during the low season.

AB  - In the backdrop of the financial crisis of 2008, this chapter investigates the role played by the bank lending channelBank lending channelin monetary policy transmissionMonetary policy transmission. The study utilizes cointegration and vector error correction models for the time period from September 2008 to March 2011. It focuses on three policy instruments viz. Cash Reserve RatioCRR, Repo rateRepo rateand Reverse Repo rateReverse repo rate. In order to investigate the inter-linkages between the real and monetary policy variables, the model includes endogenous variables, namely Index of Industrial Production, Wholesale Price Index, Money Supply, Nominal Effective Exchange Rate and the three policy instruments along with controlling for exogenous influences. Results of the econometric exercise indicate that all the three policy variables significantly impact the real variables in the economy. It seems that the three policy instruments have worked as complements during the crisis to enable monetary policy management by the Reserve Bank of India.

AB  - In the last decade the monetary policy from Romania was deeply changed. The inflation decreased considerably in comparison with the 1990s. From a few years National Bank of Romania adopted the inflation targeting strategy that implied a careful use of the monetary instruments. The success of the Central Bank depends greatly on understanding the monetary transmission mechanism. Using the VAR methodology, we analyze in this article the particularities of the monetary transmission mechanism in Romania.

TI  - Identifying the Eﬀects of Monetary Policy in a Small Open Economy with Active Foreign Exchange Interventions

AB  - Using the VAR methodology, studies of Taiwan’s monetary policy usually ﬁnd small and insigniﬁcant eﬀects on output. In this study, we examine the possibility that the minor eﬀects are the consequences of CBT’s foreign exchange interventions. Incompletely sterilized interventions may add noises to the overnight loan rate which is often used as the measure of monetary policy. The active intervention in the foreign exchange market may also clog the exchange rate channel of monetary policy. We construct a better variable measuring the monetary policy and conduct counterfactual simulations to investigate the issues. Results show that removing noises from the interest rate improves the estimation substantially, but the exchange channel does not seem to have important eﬀects on the result.

AB  - In this chapter, we explore the issues raised by attempts to coordinate monetary policy among G20 countries. There is very limited knowledge about the impact of monetary policy in the G7 countries on other G20 economies.We therefore study the effect of US monetary policy decisions on exchange rate, interest rate and export for a panel of non-G7 countries such as Mexico, Korea, China, and India. Using an identification framework based on the heteroscedasticity of structural shocks, we show that the impact of US monetary policy on different developing countries is not the same and is also different compared to G7 countries. Therefore, we conclude that coordinated monetary actions among G20 members need to be based on a better understanding of the interdependencies among G20 members.

TI  - Unconventional US Monetary Policy and International Financial Market Stability
AU  - Dean, James
AB  - From December 2008 to December 2015, the Federal Reserve held interest rates at the zero lower bound. Unable to lower short term rates further, the Fed engaged in unconventional monetary policy, buying large quantities of US assets and Treasury bonds. This paper examines the international eﬀect of these large scale asset purchases on foreign ﬁnancial markets. Using a panel VAR estimation on OECD countries, I ﬁnd the Fed’s unconventional monetary policy decreased global stock market volatility by roughly 10% with little inﬂuence on the yield curve. I ﬁnd slightly larger results for Eurozone countries. Overall, these results indicate the Fed’s unconventional monetary policies had a noticeable impact on ﬁnancial markets throughout the developed world.
