TI  - Monetary Transmission in Diverse Economies
AU  - Mahadeva, Lavan
AU  - Sinclair, Peter
AB  - The transmission mechanism of monetary policy explains how monetary policy works - which variables respond to interest rate changes, when, why, how, how much and how predictably. It is vital that central banks and their observers, worldwide, understand the transmission mechanism so that they know what monetary policy can do and what it should do to stabilize inflation and output. The volume sets out different aspects of the transmission mechanism. Some chapters scrutinize the relevance of practical issues such as asymmetries, recent structural changes and estimation errors using data on the USA, the Euro area and developing countries. Other chapters focus on modelling crucial aspects such as productivity, the exchange rate and the monetary sector. These issues are counterpointed by contributions that analyse monetary policy in Japan and the UK.

AB  - This paper uses VAR analysis to identify monetary policy shocks on U.K. data using surprise changes in the policy rate as external instruments and imposing block exogeneity restrictions on domestic variables to estimate parameters from the viewpoint of the domestic economy. The results show large and persistent effects of monetary policy shocks on the domestic economy and point to the critical role of exchange rates and term premia. The analysis resolves important empirical puzzles of traditional recursive identification methods. Revised September 2020

TI  - International Accumulation and the Contradictions of National Monetary Policy
AU  - Bryan, Dick
T2  - Science & Society
AB  - With the international mobility of money, and the integration of national capital markets, the role of nation states in securing the money system becomes ambiguous, for nation states can exert only a partial impact on the value of (internationalized) money. The effect is that national monetary policy comes to reflect the contradictions between different sections of capital which are themselves integrated into international accumulation in different ways. A consequence is that there can be no assumption (as found in the conventional analysis) that national monetary policy is inherently nationalistic in its objectives. Hence the shifting emphasis in monetary policy between the exchange rate, the interest rate, the inflation rate, etc., is to be read as changing relations between different sections of capital in international accumulation. Increasingly, national monetary policy is drawing on policies which secure wage reductions, so as to secure the monetary system without dividing capital.

AU  - Berisha, Edmond
T2  - Global Economy Journal
AB  - This paper analyses the importance of ECB monetary policy shocks in the domestic activities of a non-EMU member, Croatia, with the main focus on the inflation rate. Using a Vector Autoregressive Model with an exogenous variable specification, it is found that the contraction of foreign monetary shocks have a significant positive impact on the local inflation rate and output. Interestingly, the interest rate gap exerts a statistically significant effect on the economic activities of Croatia, suggesting that targeting exchange rate stability does not eliminate the significance of ECB’s monetary policy changes.

TI  - An analysis of the impact of the Bank of Japan’s monetary policy on Japanese government bonds’ low nominal yields
AU  - Akram, Tanweer
AU  - Li, Huiqing
T2  - Unconventional Monetary Policy and Financial Stability
AB  - Nominal yields for Japanese government bonds (JGBs) have been remarkably low for several decades. Japanese government debt ratios have continued to increase amid a protracted period of stagnant nominal GDP, low inflation and deflationary pressures. Many analysts are puzzled by the phenomenon of JGB low nominal yields because Japanese government debt ratios are elevated. However, this chapter shows that the Bank of Japan’s (BOJ) highly accommodative monetary policy is primarily responsible for keeping JGB yields low for a protracted period. This is consistent with Keynes’s view that the short-term interest rate is the key driver of the long-term interest rate. This chapter also relates the BOJ’s monetary policy and economic developments in Japan to the evolution of the long-term interest rate on JGBs.

TI  - Did Monetary Policy Matter in Prewar Japan?
AU  - Gunji, Hiroshi
AB  - In this paper, we investigate whether monetary policy in prewar Japan was effective. Notwithstanding disagreements on whether it was effective, previous works have not suffciently studied the effects. So we evaluate them using three types of methods. First, we use the Granger causality tests and impulse response functions. Second, we use monthly data, which have not been used before. Third, the narrative approach proposed by Romer and Romer (1989, NBER Macroeconomics Annual) is adopted. These results suggest that monetary policy in prewar Japan had little effect on output.

TI  - A Challenge for Monetary Policy
AU  - Heinemann, H.
AB  - The money supply registered a substantial, albeit expected, surge during the first week of September. At the same time, the Morgan Stanley proxy for total short-term business credit outstanding increased by more than $2-billion, largely as a reflection of loan demand at major money center banks in New York and Chicago. Despite sharply higher interest rates in New York, central banks were forced to commit a fair amount (preliminary calculations suggest between $600- and $700-million) to keep the dollar on an even keel in world financial markets. These interrelated developments, all reported late Thursday afternoon by the Federal Reserve System, illustrate some of the challenges that will face the Federal Open Market Committee when it convenes next Tuesday for its second meeting under the chairmanship of Paul A. Volcker.

We use logistic smooth transition vector auto regression (LSTVAR) model to focus on the nonlinearity of the whole system varying over the transition variables. The results of estimation and generalized impulse response function imply that the effects of output and inflation vary with the sign of monetary shocks, the size of monetary shocks, and the phase of the business cycle.

T2  - Economic Research-Ekonomska Istraživanja
AB  - We analyse the effects of inflation and growth uncertainty on the monetary policy reaction function of the Central Bank Republic of Turkey (C.B.R.T.), considering possible asymmetries in the reaction function over the business cycle. We follow Bec, Salem, and Collard’s approach in order to specify an asymmetric reaction function suggesting that central banker interventions are influenced by business cycles. Our results reveal that the C.B.R.T. has asymmetric preferences. We find that the C.B.R.T. targets inflation stabilisation, both in recession and expansion periods. Moreover, the C.B.R.T. reacts more aggressively to any inflation gap during recessions than it does during expansions. On the other hand, the C.B.R.T. tries to smooth fluctuations in output, both during recessions and expansions. We further discover that the C.B.R.T. reacts to inflation and growth uncertainties more aggressively in expansion periods.

TI  - International transmission of monetary shocks to the Euro area: Evidence from the U.S., Japan and China
AU  - Vespignani, Joaquin L.
T2  - Economic Modelling
AB  - The aim of this paper is to examine the influence of monetary aggregate shocks in the U.S., China and Japan on the Euro area between 1999 and 2012. There are marked differences in the effect of increases in monetary aggregates in China, Japan and the U.S. on Euro area economic and financial variables over 1999–2012. Increases in monetary aggregates in China are associated with significant increases in the world price of commodities and with increases in Euro area inflation, industrial production and exports. Results are consistent with shocks to China's M2 facilitating domestic growth with expansionary consequences for the Euro area economy. In contrast, increases in monetary aggregates in Japan are associated with significant appreciation of the Euro and decreases in Euro area industrial production and exports. Production of goods highly competitive with European goods in Japan and expenditure switching in Japan are consistent with the results. U.S. monetary expansion has relatively small effects on the Euro area over this period compared to results reported in the literature for earlier sample periods.

The monetary policy shock is the one having (i) zero impact eﬀect on real GDP and prices; (ii) a large impact eﬀect of opposite sign on non-borrowed reserves and federal funds rate. This deﬁnition provides a set of partial identifying conditions applied to monthly and quarterly post-war US data. We ﬁnd strong evidence in favor of short medium run non-neutrality. Our ﬁndings show that all the main real aggregates sharply reduce after a contractionary shock and such eﬀects last approximately 7-8 years.

TI  - Does Islamic Banking Matter in Transmitting Monetary Policy? Empirical Evidence from Indonesia and Malaysia
AU  - Audah, Muhammad Thariq
AU  - Kasri, Rahmatina Awaliah
AB  - As an interest-free banking system shows tremendous growth in many countries nowadays,
the question of how Islamic banks contribute to monetary policy transmission is increasingly
important for policymakers. This study aims to investigate and compare the role of Islamic
banks in transmitting monetary policy to the real economy in Indonesia and Malaysia, two
countries with established dual banking systems and a growing number of Islamic banks.
To achieve its objective, the study relied on Impulse Response Functions and Variance
Decomposition Analysis, based on Vector Autoregressive (VAR) methodology. The model
consisted of four variables (Islamic banks’ deposits, Islamic banks’ financing, overnight
interest rates, and economic output), while the monthly data used cover the period between
January 2007 and December 2016. The principal conclusion is that deposits and financing
of Islamic banks play an important although a modest role in transmitting monetary policy
to the economies of Indonesia and Malaysia. A plausible explanation of this result is the
relatively low market share of Islamic banks in both countries. Additionally, the lower
significance of Islamic financing in Malaysia, compared to Indonesia, is due to Malaysia’s
smaller proportion of profit-loss sharing (PLS) financing. As a result, PLS financing has a
smaller impact on Malaysian economic growth. The results suggest that to enhance their
economic impact, Islamic banks need to
increase their PLS-based financing. This
study overall findings contribute to policy
information about how Islamic banks can
contribute to achieving both economic and
monetary policy goals in Indonesia and
Malaysia.

In this paper, I investigate the differences in policy spillovers on monetary policy setting of emerging market economies. In particular, I investigated how interest differentials from major advanced economies, US, ECB and Japan, influence the movements of interest rates in emerging market economies. Using panel fixed effects regression, the results of this study show heterogeneity in the significance of policy spillover from US, ECB and Japan to emerging market economies. The results support previous findings that international monetary policy spillovers influence movements in short term interest rates, which is not explained by policy factors.

TI  - The Market-Perceived Monetary Policy Rule
AU  - Hamilton, James D.
AU  - Pruitt, Seth
AU  - Borger, Scott C.
AB  - We introduce a novel method for estimating a monetary policy rule using macroeconomic news. Market forecasts of both economic conditions and monetary policy are affected by news, and our estimation links the two effects. This enables us to estimate directly the policy rule agents use to form their expectations, and in so doing flexibly capture the particular dynamics of policy response. We find evidence that between 1994 and 2007 the market-perceived Federal Reserve policy rule changed: the output response vanished, and the inflation response path became more gradual but larger in long-run magnitude. In a standard model we show that output smoothing caused by a larger inflation response magnitude is offset by the more measured pace of response. Our response coefficient estimates are robust to measurement and theoretical issues with both potential output and the inflation target.

TI  - Is the Response of Output to Monetary Policy Asymmetric? Evidence from a Regime-Switching Coefficients Model
AU  - Piger, Jeremy
AU  - Lo, Ming Chien
AB  - This paper adopts a general approach to investigate asymmetry in the leading explanatory power of interest-rate-based indicators of monetary policy for U.S. output. The purpose is to provide robust results by utilizing a model that does not pre-specify a particular condition under which asymmetry arises. In particular, we augment an unobserved-components decomposition of real output into permanent and transitory components with monetary policy indicators. Asymmetry is captured by allowing the coefficients on the policy variables to undergo regime switching. This framework produces a latent state variable that documents when policy actions have led output. In a second stage, we use the estimated latent state variable to jointly evaluate the evidence for three specific types of asymmetry. We find that policy actions taken during periods of cyclical downturn in the economy are more likely to lead output than those taken during cyclical expansions. We also find that during periods of cyclical downturn, large policy actions and contractionary policy actions are more likely to lead output than those that are small or expansionary.

AB  - Monetary conditions and economic activity in the euro area. With a VAR model, we show that the economies of the euro area are strongly dependent on the monetary conditions (short term interest rate, exchange rate). In the long-run, the industrial activity of the area enters in a co-integrating relation with the euro-dollar real exchange rate, the euribor and the money supply M3 in real terms. In the short-run, the influence of monetary policy shocks and exchange rate shocks determines the evolution of industrial production : it reaches its full effect after about one year ; however, the influence of monetary policy through the rate of intervention of the BCE is three times higher than that of exchange rate.

AB  - In this study, the monetary transmission mechanism and the effectiveness of the credit channel have been analyzed. According to the analysis results, the most important instrument in the applications of the monetary policy in Turkey is variable interest rates. Interest rates are the most significant main effectives for all other variables and they influence the total deposit, the total credits and the size of the total security. While an increase in deposits raise the size of loanable fund by banks,an increase in credits influences the industrial production index positively. It has been concluded that an increase in industrial production depends on the volume of the banks’ credit, whilst has been is determined that credits mostly depend on loanable funds and deposits held by banks. When the first 2 periods are disregarded, it was determined that the bank lending channel has been operating in Turkey.

TI  - The Critical Role of Monetory Policy in the Link between Business Conditions and Security Returns in Taiwan - ProQuest
AB  - This study examines the relationship between the business condition proxies and security returns and whether the relationship
varies across changing monetary policy environments in Taiwan. We test the explanatory power of business condition proxies,
namely, dividend yield (D/P), term spread (TERM), and growth rate of industrial production (GIP), on stock and bond returns in
Taiwan and then incorporate monetary policy action into the business condition model to investigate its impact on the ability of
business condition proxies in accounting for stock and bond return variation over time. Empirical results suggest that the influence of
D/P and TERM on security return behavior varies dramatically with monetary policy. Furthermore, the structural relation between
D/P and TERM endures significant changes across monetary environments. These findings underline the importance for central
bankers to closely monitor monetary policy. Investors and corporate managers, based on presented evidence, should also take into
account monetary policy when modeling security market returns for investment and financing decision-making purpose.

TI  - Spillover effects from euro area monetary policy across the EU: A factor-augmented VAR approach
AU  - Potjagailo, Galina
AB  - I analyze spillover effects from Euro area monetary policy shocks to thirteen EU countries outside the Euro area, i.e., ten countries from Central and Eastern Europe (CEE) and three Western EU members. The analysis is based on a FAVAR model with two blocks which exploits a large cross-country data set covering real activity variables, prices and financial variables. An expansionary Euro area monetary policy shock raises production in most non-Euro area countries. Somewhat larger and more instantaneous responses of production are observed in small open economies with fixed exchange rate regimes, where foreign demand effects are particularly strong. In addition, a Euro area monetary expansion leads to declines in interest rates and reductions in uncertainty in most non-Euro area countries. The spillovers on uncertainty are more pronounced in economies with flexible exchange rates, where the degree of financial market openness tends to be higher and where exchange rate appreciations further enhance risk taking by cushioning debt burdens from foreign currency loans. Finally, spillover effects on prices are heterogeneous across countries and behave asymmetrically in most CEE countries.

AB  - We study in a VAR model the effects of monetary policy shocks with new Italian flow of funds data for 1980-2002. First, our results are consistent with the literature, without being affected by commonly found puzzles. Second, new features of the transmission of monetary policy shocks to the Italian economy are provided. We do not find evidence in favour of financial frictions which would prevent firms from a prompt reduction of nominal expenditures. Households also quickly adjust their portfolios leading to a careful evaluation of the hypothesis underlying limited participation models. Finally, the public sector increases net borrowing after the shock, improving on puzzling opposite results in the literature.

AB  - The research looked at how monetary policy shocks affects rice output in Nigeria. The study made use of time series data spanning the year 1981 to 2020 obtained from the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) and National Bureau of Statistics (NBS). The shocks were detected using the Vector Auto-Regressive model (VAR). The study revealed that unit shocks in interest rates, inflation, and exchange rates all harmed rice output with rice output responding more to a unit shock in interest rate. Monetary policy shocks have both positive and negative effects on rice output at different periods. This study concluded, however, that the timing of monetary policy instruments change has serious implications for rice output, and that rice output can bring about positive change in Nigeria's agricultural output if monetary policy instruments are well managed. The study recommended that the monetary authority should ensure that various policies are implemented to ensure that the interest rate to the agricultural sector is within a single digit, accessible, affordable, and sustainable to ensure greater productivity in the sector, as it accounted for the greatest shock in comparison to other monetary variables, the monetary authority should pursue an exchange rate policy that encourages investment in the Nigerian economy's real sector while maintaining market stability.

AB  - This paper investigates the reaction of equity and volatility indices in the U.S. and Canada to changes in monetary policy by each respective country. The results confirm previous literature that suggests contractionary changes in monetary policy in the U.S. results in downward pressure on U.S. equity indices. Additionally, this research finds that monetary policy changes do not have any significant impact on the volatilely index in the U.S. (VIX). The results from the Canadian data show a much different picture. Contractionary changes of monetary policy in both Canada and the U.S. seem to drive Canadian equity markets in an upward manner. These monetary policy shocks also have a significant impact on volatilely indices in Canada. This research documents the dynamic relationship monetary policy has on equity markets in the U.S. and Canada.

TI  - Measuring monetary policy (in)effectiveness in Russia: a structural dynamic factor model approach
AU  - Pestova, Anna
AU  - Rostova, Natalia
AB  - In this paper, we estimate the effect of monetary policy shocks on a wide range of Russian macroeconomic indicators using modern structural dynamic factor model approach (SDFM). The main advantage of the DFM over the standard structural vector autoregression models (VARs) is that DFMs allow us to avoid “the curse of the dimensionality” and at the same time include the large number of macroeconomic series into the model. The monetary policy shocks here are identified by means of sign restrictions. 57 monthly time series spanning from 2003 to 2017 are used to estimate the SDFM. The structural model is also re-estimated for the two sub-periods which correspond to the monetary policy shift from the exchange rate targeting to inflation targeting in Russia: January 2003 – June 2008 and January 2010 – February 2017. The results for the whole period indicate the significant negative impact of the contractionary monetary policy shock on the real and financial sectors of the economy. The estimated model for the first period points to the non-significant effect of the restrictive monetary policy shock on market interest rates. That confirms the poor efficiency of interest rate channel of monetary transmission during pre-2008 crisis period. The results for the second period show that the most of responses are surprisingly not significant. That could be explained by the several notions. During that period, the monetary policy conducted by the Bank of Russia was not perfectly homogenous. Indeed, since 2013 the Central Bank has changed the main policy instrument and in 2014 finally moved to the inflation targeting and the floating exchange rate regime. Moreover, we found some evidence that “the price puzzle” might exist in the Russian economy for the considered 20102017 period. These results for Russian economy may be interpreted as the evidence that the monetary policy tightening in Russia has a limited ability to restrain inflation.

TI  - Monetary Policy Transmission in Russia (1992-96): The Role of Industrial Interenterprise Arrears - ProQuest
AB  - The thesis addresses the possible channels of monetary policy influence on the
decline of output in Russia. In particular, it considers the role of interenterprise arrears in
the transmission process, as well as the question of whether monetary impulses could affect
the sectoral pattern of the industrial recession. It appeal's that the fall in output related to
monetary contraction may be significant, given the deficiencies of the credit market, while
distortions associated with the policy (which resulted in a lack of liquid assets in the system
and was translated into the outburst of quasi-money and extremely high interest rates) may
lengthen the recession.
Underdevelopment of the financial sector alters the propagation mechanisms of
monetary impulses. The lending channel, which is likely to remain the main channel in
initial stages of transition, is significantly modified in comparison with the one in
developed economies. On the supply side the lack of adequate substitutes for the Central
bank of Russia (CBR) loanable funds, reflecting the structural weakness of the banking
system, intensifies the decline of credit supply in periods of monetary tightening. On the
demand side the lack of substitutes for bank credit deepens enterprise-side reaction,
adversely affecting the viability of firms in the long-run.
We examine the role of interenterprise arrears using a two-sector (energy vs
manufacturing) non-Walrasian general equilibrium model with price regulation and credit
rationing. The model explains the transactions’ role of money and reveals that
interenterprise arrears may soften or strengthen production-side responses to monetary
impulse in the steady state (if compared with the case when no arrears are allowed). The
precise results depend on the characteristics of the production function and the transaction
cost function, and the level of real money balances. Empirical evidence appears to favor the
“cushioning” effect of arrears.
The model allows one to highlight the mechanisms through which policy, meant to
fight inflation, could cause an increase in inflation together with a decline of both sectors’
output and consumption. Two versions of the model are considered: one with credit
rationing of both sectors, and one with asymmetric rationing. The latter appeal's to receive
significant empirical support for 1994-96, suggesting that deeper decline in the
manufacturing sector may partially, along with other reasons, be explained by its higher
exposure to credit-rationing, and therefore, higher losses associated with monetary
tightening. A relaxation of the credit rationing constraint to the second sector, and/or a
decrease in interest rates, may be growth promoting strategies, implying that there is scope
for governmental intervention

AU  - Smant, David / D. J. C.
AB  - The "credit view" emphasizes the impact of monetary policy on the amount and conditions of credit
supplied by the banking sector as a main transmission channel. A review of the literature shows that the
view that banks are in some sense special is widely accepted. However, whether the bank credit channel is
an important part of the aggregate monetary transmission remains questionable. There is no evidence for
credit rationing, at least not at the macroeconomic level. Many of the empirical results on the credit
channel have alternative interpretations. Much of the debate on a bank credit channel appears to deal with
effects of second-order importance.

TI  - ECB’s measures and the European crisis.
AU  - Berti, Lorenzo
AB  - The European crisis can be decomposed into three highly interrelated crises: a bank crisis,
where banks faced liquidity and solvency problems, leading to a contraction of credit; a
sovereign debt crisis, where governments, incurring into high funding costs, met an
increasing default risk; a growth crisis, since a mixture of credit crunch by the banking
system, government measures of fiscal austerity and inefficient production and labor
markets led to low GDP growth and rising unemployment.
In order to tackle the crisis, the ECB recurred to a number of conventional and
unconventional measures. Previous works show that ECB’s interventions succeeded in
cushioning the economic downturn, helping certain market segments to restore, in order to
guarantee the proper functioning of monetary policy channels.
This work aims to report an overview of the European crisis, showing some results of
previous works concerning the effectiveness of ECB’s measures in different areas.
Furthermore, by recurring to a structural vector autoregression (SVAR) model, it
investigates the impact of unconventional monetary policy on production and prices in the
Italian case, implementing an impulse response approach to non-standard monetary policy
innovations. The results are consistent with previous findings: monetary policy appears to
affect output only in the short term, while producing persistent effects on inflation.

AB  - China has been in rapid economic growth and industrial structure reform for recent years, and oil, as a most important raw material for industrial production, its price fluctuations have direct impact on energy-intensive industries as well as non-energy-intensive industries and their associated industries’ overall demands. Under the price transmission mechanism, oil price volatility imposes significant influences on economic growth rate, price level, unemployment rate and monetary policy as well. This paper established VAR model among oil prices and economic indicators such as economic growth rate, price level, unemployment rate and monetary policy, and by data processing , stability test and cointegration test, we found that there existed long term stable cointegration relations among these sequences; through Granger Causality test we found that oil price volatility was the Granger cause of the fluctuations of economic growth rate, price level and monetary policy, and meanwhile, changes in economic growth rate is the Granger cause of that in price level. The result of our empirical study indicated that, oil price volatility has a profound influence on China’s economy, and thus, China should improve the establishment of the oil futures market to avoid risks of oil price volatility and secure long-term stability of its economic growth.

Cholesky decomposition and the recent sign restrictions agnostic procedure
with a single zero restriction. Unconventional monetary policy is represented
as a decrease in the expected federal funds rate which leaves the federal funds
rate itself unchanged. I nd that both the standard and the unconventional
monetary policy shock have a negative eect on ination expectations and
that this eect is stronger for the latter. Similar results are found using
alternative measures of unconventional monetary policy.

AB  - . Monetary policy is one of the important monetary subjects that can evaluate the performance of the policy and its tools, recent development in financial markets in the past years led to changes in the behavior of countries monetary policies, concentrated to achieve stability in the price level by creating new ideas of how monetary policy affects the economy and its components through linking macroeconomic activities (private spending components) with nominal interest rate. This study aims to analyze and evaluate the impact of Jordanian monetary policy on consumption and investment spending during the period (1989-2013) to predict the impact of monetary policy and its instruments on real economic activities and inflation. The study finds that lending rate affects investment negatively but it does not affect consumption and real GDP in the short run. However, in the long run investment is affected by the co-movements occurred in consumption lending rate and lagged investment. Also, the study finds that real GDP is affected by the co- movements that occurred in real GDP and lending rate. Furthermore, domestic credit is affected by the co-movements that happened in domestic credit and lending rate.Keywords.

T2  - IOP Conference Series: Earth and Environmental Science
AB  - The effectiveness of monetary policy on the real sector has been a major concern of the monetary authority in Nigeria, over a few years ago. This has resulted in series of regulatory actions of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) to ensure more funds/credit are channeled to the sector, in line with the policy objectives of the government to improve the sector. The inability of the real sector investors to meet up with their loan repayment obligations sometimes restricts the flow of this credit from the banking system to the sector, thereby jeopardizing the efforts of the monetary authority. This study, while investigating this concern, observed a similar trend pattern between real sector business outlook and real productive activities; this warranted the inclusion of this variable in the model that was estimated with SVAR. The results revealed a significant estimate of 7.95583; which is a contemporaneous response of credit to real sector to shocks from real sector business outlook. Also, an average of 0.21% variation in real output is explained by structural innovations from real sector business outlook. This means that as business or macroeconomic environment improves, the real investors invest more by accessing credit from the banking system; also, the banks are more confident of loan repayment, as the improved macroeconomic environment is expected to support business growth.

AB  - This paper uses Japanese data to investigate the relationship between monetary policy and the yield curve. We find that the response of the yield curve depends in an important way on the maintained hypothesis about how monetary policy affects the economy. Under the liquidity effect maintained hypothesis monetary policy only has transient effects on the yield curve. Under the costly price adjustment maintained hypothesis, however, monetary policy has large and persistent effects on yields of all maturities.

TI  - Rearmament, Recovery and Monetary Policy
AU  - Bach, G. L.
T2  - The American Economic Review
AB  - We are at present faced with the triple problem of rearmament, recovery, and avoidance of price inflation. An acceptable monetary policy needs to be calculated to achieve all three objectives, plus the maintenance of full employment once obtained. With the present rapid surge toward full employment and the special pressures for arms production, conflicts of interest appear likely, especially over wage increases. Adoption of a stable policy "rule" (such as price stabilization) as the basis for monetary and fiscal policy might provide the basis for a workable "truce" between labor, monetary authorities, and those in charge of rearmament. Other primary advantages of monetary stabilization around a stated "rule" are (1) the basis it provides for "equity," (2) its stabilizing effect on business conditions, and (3) its elimination of the necessity for further centralization of power in the hands of discretionary monetary "authorities." The arguments that adoption of such a stable policy would involve loss of desirable flexibility have been much overstated. The choice between alternative "stable money" policies is largely a matter of expediency. Present institutional conditions, especially in regard to labor, point toward price stabilization as the most expedient choice.

T2  - Economic Brief
AB  - The U.S. presidential election of 1896 provides an excellent natural experiment to measure the impact of exchange-rate uncertainty on bank balance sheets and the broader economy. The evidence suggests that the election's contentious free-silver debate significantly constrained banking activity and real economic activity by creating greater uncertainty about U.S. commitment to the gold standard. This finding reinforces the modern-day wisdom of insulating monetary policy from politics.

TI  - Synchronization in wage setting and the effects of monetary policy - LSE Research Online
AB  - Systematic differences in the timing of wage setting decisions among industrialized countries provide an ideal framework to study the importance of wage rigidity in the transmission of monetary policy. The Japanese Shunto, for example, presents a clear case of bunching in wage setting decisions: From February to May, most firms set wages that remain in place until the following year; wage rigidity, thus, is relatively higher immediately after the Shunto. In contrast, wage agreements in Germany are well-spread within the calendar year, implying a relatively uniform degree of rigidity. We exploit the variation in timing of wage agreements within the year in Japan vis-à-vis the three largest European countries (Germany, the UK, and France) to investigate the effects of monetary policy under different degrees of effective wage rigidity. Our findings lend support to the long-held, though scarcely tested, view that wage-rigidity plays a key role in the transmission of monetary policy.

AB  - In this study some important aspects of monetary policy in Germany are theoretically and empirically investigated. In die first part, we analyse the institutional framework for the Bundesbank and point out preconditions for the policy of monetary targeting. Especially, we show, that the Bundesbank is neither able to achieve the final goals of monetary policy directly nor to control the interim target money supply exactly in the short run. The available instruments are only suitable to influence money market rates and liquidity within the banking system. In the second part, we empirically examine some of the mentioned preconditions and problems of monetary policy with data for West Germany. Three subjects are of our main interest. First the money demand function and second the money market control of the Bundesbank to give an answer to the questions of controllability of money supply by monetary instruments. Our final point concerns the determinants of the behaviour of the Bundesbank due to a monetary reaction function.

AB  - The goal of this work is to reveal differences in transferring the regulator’s policy before and after the 2008
financial crisis. The research was made by using the method of vector auto-regression. The analysis was related
to the channel of interest rate, corporate crediting, volumes of money supply, and growth of the prices level.
Differences in the monetary policy of the regulator before and after the 2008 financial crisis were interpreted.
Changes in the transfer of the regulator’s monetary policy via channels of the monetary transmission: the level
of prices, interest, rate, bank crediting, and channel of monetary flows were statistically confirmed.
It was determined that the specified channels had relative importance in transferring the policy and acted with
the relatively different level of efficiency during the pre- and post-crisis period. The growth of efficiency of the
channel related to the unforeseen growth of prices level, channel of bank crediting, and channel of monetary
flows during the post-crisis period were revealed. Results of the research can be used for further theoretical
and empiric analysis of the transmission mechanism. Results of such researches are useful for the regulator to
pursue efficient monetary policy, for commercial banks to take into account when forming the development
strategy whose important element is a system of financial stability management

TI  - Fiscal and Monetary Policy Interaction in Malawi
AU  - Matola, Joseph Upile
AB  - In this paper, the interaction between fiscal and monetary policies in Malawi is analyzed in a structural VAR framework employing sign restrictions. The key question addressed is whether macroeconomic policy environment in Malawi is characterized by fiscal dominance or monetary dominance. The model that we derive is used to identify government spending shocks, government revenue shocks, and monetary policy shocks so as to observe their respective effects on the conduct of fiscal and monetary policy. The results show that policy making in Malawi leans towards a monetary dominant regime rather than a fiscal dominant one. This is manifested by a counteractive reaction of monetary policy to loose fiscal policy on one hand and a cooperative reaction of fiscal policy to tight monetary policy stance on the other hand. The results also show that spending shocks are not financed by tax revenues which, coupled with the noncooperative nature of monetary policy, is consistent the high public debt accumulation observed in the data.

AB  - In this study interest centers on regional differences in the response of housing prices to monetary policy shocks in the US. We address this issue by analyzing monthly home price data for metropolitan regions using a factor-augmented vector autoregression (FAVAR) model. Bayesian model estimation is based on Gibbs sampling with Normal-Gamma shrinkage priors for the autoregressive coefficients and factor loadings, while monetary policy shocks are identified using high-frequency surprises around policy announcements as external instruments. The empirical results indicate that monetary policy actions typically have sizeable and significant positive effects on regional housing prices, revealing differences in magnitude and duration. The largest effects are observed in regions located in states on both the East and West Coasts, notably California, Arizona and Florida.

AB  - The recent implementation of unconventional monetary policies in advanced economies and the preparations for an eventual return to normalization have renewed the interest in spillover effects of monetary policy on emerging market economies. This paper estimates a series of VAR-X models for a set of 10 emerging economies, that is, VARs in which U.S. policy enters exogenously. The contribution of this paper is (a) to use an identified shock component of the U.S. (shadow) federal funds rate as a consistent policy instrument for conventional and unconventional policies, (b) to account for changes in the transmission of U.S. monetary policy over time, and (c) to quantify asymmetries in the transmission of tightening and easing shocks. The results point to substantially nonlinear and asymmetric spillover effects, which pose challenges to policymakers.

AB  - In India the main objective of credit control policy by Reserve Bank of India (RBI) in the era of planned economic development was to achieved ‘growth with stability’. In the context of this objective RBI adopts ‘controlled credit expansion’ policy which means the main long term objective of banks monetary policy is to expand credit. But to control this credit expansion according to the present need and circumstances of our economy RBI has made different solution. Since January 2015, the RBI has cut policy rates by a cumulative 125 basis points (bps), while banks have cut one-year deposit rates by an average 130 bps and lending by 50 bps, which includes the base rate cuts in the month of September. On 29 September 2015, when RBI declare its new rates of monetary policy many commercial bank(i.e. ICICI Bank, Yes Bank, Kotak Mahindara and Allahabad Bank etc.) joined this changes and also change their interest rate which is directly affect Indian market. This paper is reveals the effect of new monetary policy on the Indian market.

AB  - We investigate the monetary policy of the Federal Reserve Board during six periods in US economic history 1959–2008. In particular, we examine the Fed's response to changes in three guiding variables: inflation, π, unemployment, U, and industrial production, y, during periods with low and high economic stability. We identify separate responses for the Fed's change in interest rate depending upon (i) the current rate, FF, and the guiding variables’ level below or above their average values and (ii) recent movements in inflation and unemployment. The change in rate, ΔFF, can then be calculated. We identify policies that both increased and decreased economic stability.

AU  - Laganà, Gianluca

T2  - The Manchester School
AB  - This paper investigates the determinants of UK interest rates using a factor-augmented vector autoregression model (VAR), similar to the one suggested by Bernanke, Boivin and Eliasz (Quarterly Journal of Economics, Vol. 120 (2005), No. 1, pp. 387–422). The method allows impulse response functions to be generated for all the variables in the data set and so is able to provide a more complete description of UK monetary policy than is possible using standard VARs. The results show that the addition of factors to a benchmark VAR generates a more reasonable characterization of the effects of unexpected increases in the interest rate and, in particular, gets rid of a ‘price puzzle’ response present in the benchmark VAR. The extra information generated by this method, however, also brings to light other identification issues, notably house price and stock market ‘puzzles’. Importantly the out-of-sample prediction performance of the factor-augmented VARs is also very good and strongly superior to those of the benchmark VAR and simple autoregression models.

AB  - AbstractThe economic authorities of each country seek to maintain the expansion phase through the implementation of various economic policy measures, namely, to prevent or mitigate the recessionary phase in economic development. In that context, it is of considerable importance to understand how monetary policy decisions affect the movement of macroeconomic variables. The paper aims to examine and evaluate the contribution of monetary policy to mitigating the effects of the global economic and financial crisis, using the Autoregressive Distributed Lag model, by analysing the impact of the real exchange rate, reference interest rate and money supply on the level of economic activity in Poland. Econometric analysis encompasses the period from 2006 to 2017. The research results suggest that there is a significant relationship between real economic activity and the real exchange rate both in the short and long term, but not between the reference interest rate and the money supply.

Degree: Ph.D.DegreeYear: 1981Institute: Brown UniversityA primary characteristic of the equilibrium business cycle model exposited by Lucas, Barro and others is that only the unperceived and unanticipated part of monetary growth causes output fluctuations. This characteristic is an implication of the four theoretical underpinnings of the model, (1) rational expectations, (2) a market-clearing structure that incorporates the natural rate hypothesis, (3) incomplete information about real and monetary disturbances, (4) a nondeterministic specification of these key exogenous variables. The dichotomy of the effects of monetary growth between unperceived-nonneutral and perceived-neutral growth implies that any feedback monetary policy will have no effect on current output. However this dichotomy also implies, in a world of contemporaneously perceived money growth, that any observed money stock changes cannot cause changes in current output. The model in this essay formally develops the theoretical relation between price and quantity determination and contemporaneously perceived money growth in the equilibrium model. The theoretical structure is extended to account for monetary feedback policy, persistence effects, the apparent gradualness of error discovery in preliminary monetary data and correlation between errors in monetary data. The primary prediction of the theoretical model is that innovations to aggregate output have zero covariance with current and past values of preliminary monetary growth. This implication of the equilibrium model is a testable hypothesis. This hypothesis was tested using post-Korean War U.S. data on industrial production, the employment rate as real variables and a newly constructed quarterly series on contemporaneously observed monetary growth (M1). The actual tests took the form of a regression of current output on past output and past values of contemporaneously observed money growth. The hypothesis that supports the model is that the monetary variables contribute no explanatory power in this regression equation. The preponderance of evidence from the statistical tests indicates that contemporaneously observed money growth did influence output over the sample period.A second testable hypothesis drawn from the theory relates to the unperceived-nonneutral part of monetary growth. Specifically the theory predicts that the revisions to contemporaneously observed money represent a potentially important source of unperceived money growth and should have nonneutral output effects. Because of intertemporal correlations between exogenous variables and the gradualness of error discovery in preliminary monetary data, the testable hypothesis that supports the equilibrium model is that in a regression of current output on lagged output and current and lagged revisions the monetary revisions should have a positive and significant effect on current output. The revised M1 series used to construct this test was the historical M1 series known as of January 1980. The preponderance of evidence from extensive tests of the second hypothesis is that monetary revisions do not have the predicted effect on output.The conclusion of this study, based on the above empirical findings, is that the equilibrium model cannot explain the data. The negative conclusion is disturbing in the sense that the equilibrium model, until now, provided a theoretical setup that was consistent with the idea that agents exploit perceived gains from trade and could explain the apparent causal relation of money in the business cycle. The rejection of this model leaves modern business cycle theory without an explanation for economic fluctuations that is theoretically appealing and has strong empirical support.

AB  - This paper examines the spillover effects of Japanese monetary policy on Chinese macro economy - during and in the aftermath of 2007–2008 financial crisis. Study periods are divided into two: from January 2007 to January 2013 as the first period and from April 2013 to December 2015 as the second one. The reason why we take 2013 as threshold is that since 2013, Japan executed more radical quantitative easing policy and China experienced an obvious slow economic growth and deepen market oriented interest rate reform and exchange rate reform. The results of VAR model analysis shows that Japanese monetary policy did have spillover effects on China economy, while behavior of two stages were different. Japanese monetary policy mainly affected Chinese money supply, exchange rates and interest rates at the first stage, while it mainly affected Chinese output and trade level at the second stage.

TI  - The Determinants of Future U.S. Monetary Policy: High-Frequency Evidence
AU  - Taylor, Nicholas
T2  - Journal of Money, Credit and Banking
AB  - This paper examines the determinants of future U.S. monetary policy by studying the relationship between a predictor of the future direction of monetary policy and a pertinent information set. Specifically, we investigate the impact of the surprise component of an array of macro-economic announcements upon federal funds futures rates. This investigation is conducted using high-frequency intraday data in order to examine the exact timing of rate reactions to announcements. In doing this, we find that Non-farm Payrolls and Civilian Unemployment announcements play a dominant role in determining future monetary policy. Moreover, we document evidence that shows that the release of such information is rapidly incorporated into rates, particularly when considering federal funds futures contracts traded via an electronic trading platform (as opposed to an open-auction trading platform).

AB  - The aim of this paper is to examine whether the commodity prices predicting inflation, unemployment and short term interest rate in Australia. Time series econometrics such as vector autoregressive model, cointegration and granger causality are used for this purpose. The empirical shows that three commodity prices (COMRL, COMNRL and COMBSMTL) precede inflation. However, no evidence of reverse causation is found. These finding have important implication for monetary authority. Inflation targeting experience has so far been hit by positive supply shocks. In case of negative supply shock, commodity price may be useful in singling out the likely direction of inflation.

AU  - Berument, M. Hakan

T2  - Applied Economics
AB  - A coherent method to measure the effectiveness of a monetary policy improves the monetary authority’s management capacity and renders the possibility of applying sound policies prior to and during a crisis. The trend in employing complicated and ambiguity-bearing unconventional monetary tools in the aftermath of the 2008 crisis has increased the value of such a method. The aim of this article is to introduce a coherent and consistent monetary policy evaluation method for Turkey. Accordingly, we suggest that innovations in the spread between overnight interest rates and Treasury auction interest rates are informative for exchange rate, output, and prices. Empirical evidence for this identification reveals that positive innovation in spread (implying a tight monetary policy measure) decreases output temporarily, permanently decreases prices, and appreciates local currency. This result is also robust to alternative specifications.

T2  - Emerging Markets Finance and Trade
AB  - This paper investigates how a change in monetary policy affects the degree and the speed of exchange rate pass-through to import prices in the emerging market economy, using a newly constructed data set from Taiwan's trading commodities. First, the analytical framework is set up following Goldberg and Knetter (1997) and Campa and Goldberg (2005). Next, the period-by-period and the multiple-period cumulative effects of monetary policy on the degree of exchange rate pass-through can be traced out. The dynamic panel data model is then estimated by Bun and Carree's (2005) bias-corrected approach, which enjoys easy calculation and robust testing performances, leading to more reliable empirical results. Our cross-commodity evidence strongly supports the partial pass-through in the short run and the complete pass-through in the long run. Moreover, following a change in monetary policy, this pass-through effect increases during several initial periods and declines to zero over time.

AB  - In many countries, low and stable inflation is the focus of monetary policy. Recent empirical evidence from developing countries indicates, however, that the costs of reducing inflation are disproportionately borne by women. This paper seeks to determine whether a similar pattern is evident in nine Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Economic Development (OECD) countries, using quarterly data for 1980–2004. The study examines economy-wide and sectoral employment effects by gender by utilizing two methodologies: single equation regression and vector autoregression analysis. Results indicate that the link between monetary policy instruments (short-term interest rates) and employment in the industrial countries under investigation is weak and does not vary by gender.

AB  - This paper uses detailed firm-level data to show that monetary policy affects employment through housing collateral and corporate debt. Our research design exploits the fact that many small and medium-sized enterprises use their directors' homes as a key source of collateral for corporate loans, but directors typically live in a different region to their firm. This spatial separation of firms from their collateral allows us to distinguish the collateral channel from local demand effects. We find that younger and more levered firms with higher exposure to housing collateral fluctuations adjust employment the most following a change in monetary policy. The collateral channel explains a sizeable share of the aggregate employment response.

We find that banks with higher mortgage-backed securities holdings refinanced relatively more mortgages after the first round of QE, which increased local consumption and employment in the nontradable goods sector. In contrast, banks increased lending to firms and home purchase mortgage origination after the third round of QE, which led to a sizable increase in overall employment. Our findings are supported by new confidential loan-level data that show firms with stronger ties to affected banks increased employment and capital investment more during QE3.

TI  - The effect of monetary policy on the financial performance of commercial Banks in Kenya
AU  - Mulwa, Geoffrey K.
AB  - Monetary policy is one of the principal economic management tools that the government uses to shape economic performance. The government through the Central Bank uses monetary policy tools like open market operations, central bank rate and cash reserve ratio for commercial banks with the objective of managing multiple monetary targets among them price stability, promotion of growth, achieving full employment, smoothing the business cycle, preventing financial crises, stabilizing long-term interest rates and the real exchange rate. Commercial banks act as a mediator for the Central Bank in implementing these tools and hence the basis for this study. This study was carried out with the following objectives; to establish the effect of Central Bank‟s open market operations on the financial performance of Commercial Banks; to establish the effect of Central Bank Rate (CBR) on the financial performance of Commercial Banks and to establish the effect of Reserve Ratio Requirement on the financial performance of Commercial Banks. The study adopted descriptive research design. The target population of this study was commercial banks operating in Kenya and regulated by the Central Bank of Kenya as at 31st December 2014. For the purpose of this study, only secondary data was used. The secondary data was sourced from the Financial Statements of the commercial Banks that are available from their websites and Central Bank of Kenya Publications. Data was collected for a period of five years from 2010 to 2014. Data was analyzed using Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) version 16. The study then used descriptive statistics and inferential statistics to establish the relationship between monetary policies tools and the financial performance of commercial banks in Kenya. The study used Net Interest Margin as the measure for financial performance for the banks. The results showed that the model explained 17.7% of the variance in financial performance of commercial banks as given by the value of R2. The model was also fit to explain the relationship as the F-Statistic of 5.581 was significant at 5% level, p=0.000. The study established that monetary policy tools as represented by open market operation β=0.506, p=0.608, CBR, β=-0.221, p=0.687, and cash reserve ratio, β=-4.349, p=0.622, have no significant effect on the financial performance of commercial banks in Kenya. Bank size was however found to have a weak positive effect, β = 0.009, p <0.0, on financial performance of commercial banks in Kenya. The study concludes that monetary policy tools employed by the central bank of Kenya do not have a significant effect on the financial performance of commercial banks in Kenya. The study therefore recommends that commercial banks need to focus more on the internal factors that affect financial performance of commercial banks as have been identified in other studies. The study further recommends that commercial banks should focus on monetary policy changes to the extent of complying with the Central Bank guidelines and adjusting their variables accordingly. This is a matter of management efficiency.

AB  - We use high-frequency administrative data from Germany to study the eﬀect of monetary-policy shocks on incomes and employment prospects along the income distribution. We ﬁnd that income growth at the bottom of the income distribution is substantially more aﬀected by monetary policy shocks. Much of this heterogeneity comes from stronger eﬀects of these shocks on the separation rates of the poor. We compare this heterogeneous incidence of monetary-policy shocks to that of average business-cycle movements in our sample.

T2  - International Economic Journal
AB  - This paper investigates the effect of monetary policy on liquidity creation of commercial banks and if the effect is conditional on bank size. The paper uses a dataset covering 23 Vietnamese commercial banks during the period 2007–2017 collected from various sources including State Bank of Vietnam, International Monetary Fund, SNL Financial database (provided by SNL Company), Vietnam General Statistic Office and banks’ annual reports. Different econometric techniques are employed to analyse the data. Obtained results indicate that a contractionary monetary policy could lead to a decrease in bank liquidity creation. This result is less pronounced with larger banks. In particular, among three monetary policy instruments employed in Vietnam, an increase in the base rate is significantly associated with a contraction in bank liquidity creation; open market operations may have a marginal impact while required reserve ratio is ineffective because of its unchanged value throughout the period of the study. This paper is among the first, providing an insight into each monetary policy instrument's role in influencing bank liquidity creation in the context of an emerging economy.

T2  - Journal of International Money and Finance
AB  - We study empirically the distributional implications of ECB non-standard monetary policy by exploiting a rich micro dataset on Italian households’ income and wealth, and contemporaneously taking into account all relevant transmission channels. Our results do not support the claim that an unconventional monetary loosening acts as a “reverse Robin Hood”. Larger benefits accrue to households at the bottom of the income scale, as the effects via the stimulus to economic activity and employment outweigh those via financial markets. The response of net wealth is moderately U-shaped: less wealthy households take advantage of their leveraged positions, wealthier households of their larger share of financial assets. Overall, the effects on inequality are negligible. The results also suggest that savers are not hurt, as the decrease in the remuneration of assets is compensated by support to labour income and by capital gains.

We find that the employment response is stronger for firms in manufacturing and construction relative to firms in services. The result also holds within small and large firms. Moreover, within sectors, the employment growth in large firms responds more than it does in small firms after monetary contractions; it does so less after monetary expansions. Finally, we find that the differences in employment growth between small and large firms are greater for firms in the manufacturing and construction sectors compared to those in the service sector.

T2  - International Social Science Journal
AB  - The empirical evidence on the nexus between monetary policy and economic growth remains ambiguous with mixed and differing results, depending on the country's characteristics, the choice of monetary policy variables employed, and recently, the place of financial inclusion in monetary policy formulation and transmission mechanism. This study explores the nexus between monetary policy and economic growth in Nigeria while accounting for the roles of interest rate, money supply, and financial inclusion over a base period of 2004q1 to 2020q4 and a projected period of 30 quarters. Using the dynamic simulation autoregressive distributed lag (ARDL) model, the study finds that in the short run, only the effect of money supply on economic growth is statistically significant. However, in the long run, interest rate, money supply, and financial inclusion have statistically significant effects on economic growth. The results are supported by the plots of the dynamic simulated ARDL, where economic growth response is predicted at various time periods after forcing a ±1% change (positive and negative shocks) in interest rate, money supply, and financial inclusion. We, therefore, recommend among other things an aggressive financial inclusion strategy with clearly defined deliverables and timelines to reduce the percentage of persons excluded from the formal financial system.

AU  - Epstein, Gerald
AU  - Heintz, James
AB  - This report summarizes the findings of a UNDP-sponsored study on the structure of the financial sector, central bank policy, and employment outcomes in Ghana. The financial sector is the primary conduit through which monetary policy affects real economic outcomes, and monetary policy determines the resources available to financial institutions. Therefore, monetary policy must be coordinated with financial sector reforms in order to improve employment opportunities, reduce poverty and support human development. The report develops a critique of financial programming and inflation targeting, presents a series of empirical estimates on the impact of monetary policy variables in Ghana, and describes the elements of an alternative monetary policy. In addition, the report documents the institutional and structural constraints currently operating in the financial system which prevent the sector from facilitating investment, growth, and improved employment opportunities. Econometric estimates of the determinants of investment explicitly link financial variables to real economic activity. The report summarizes a series of financial sector reforms that would improve the financial sector's capacity to move Ghana onto an employment-intensive growth path.

T2  - Journal of Corporate Finance
AB  - Collateral-based monetary policy tools in China aim to guide credit resources to the real economy by injecting base money into banks to support policy objectives, such as promoting employment. This study examines the effects of Medium-term Lending Facilities (MLF) on employment through the bank lending channel. The results of difference-in-differences estimation show that post-MLF implementation, employment growth and labor cost growth of firms with high MLF exposure increase by 8.04% and 5.74%, respectively. The channel test shows that commercial banks with high bond holdings significantly increase lending after MLF implementation, which subsequently increases employment for borrowers of these banks. This effect is more pronounced for firms with high dependence on external financing, strong financing constraints, no qualifications to issue bonds, high sales growth, and belonging to industries supported by industrial policies. MLF also improves the quality of employment, which in turn significantly increases the total factor productivity of firms. Finally, MLF also has a significant positive effect on local aggregate employment growth. Focusing on firm labor hiring decisions, which are crucial to real economic development and social stability, this study has important theoretical and practical implications for furthering our understanding of the effectiveness and feasibility of collateral-based monetary policy tools.

AB  - Estimating the response of asset prices to changes in monetary policy is complicated by the endogeneity of policy decisions and the fact that both interest rates and asset prices react to numerous other variables. This paper develops a new estimator that is based on the heteroskedasticity that exists in high-frequency data. We show that the response of asset prices to changes in monetary policy can be identified based on the increase in the variance of policy shocks that occurs on days of FOMC meetings and of the Chairman's semi-annual monetary policy testimony to Congress. The identification approach employed requires a much weaker set of assumptions than needed under the “event-study” approach that is typically used in this context. The results indicate that an increase in short-term interest rates results in a decline in stock prices and in an upward shift in the yield curve that becomes smaller at longer maturities. The findings also suggest that the event-study estimates contain biases that make the estimated effects on stock prices appear too small and those on Treasury yields too large.

TI  - How does monetary policy affect the exchange rate? Empirical evidence from G-7 countries.
AU  - Kalbasi Anaraki N.
AB  - Degree: Ph.D.DegreeYear: 2002Institute: George Mason UniversityAdviser: Carlos D. Ramirez.Theories on the real exchange rate behavior can be divided into four different categories: (i) models with fundamentals are a variation of simple monetary models, including models with flexible nominal prices and models with sluggish nominal price adjustment and overshooting; (ii) equilibrium models emphasizing real disturbances to tastes and technologies; (iii) portfolio-balance models, which assume that domestic and foreign securities are not perfect substitutes and emphasize different domestic and foreign assets, including current account balances; and (iv) speculative bubbles, which focus on unpredictable components of exchange rates.My original motivation for carrying out empirical studies on the effects of monetary policy on exchange rate was to investigate the contradictory findings of different models. The first chapter presents the theoretical background and detailed empirical studies.The next two chapters investigate what is the transmission channel of monetary policy.The second chapter pays particular attention to the puzzle first suggested by Meese and Rogoff (1983), who argued that a random walk model beats all the competing models based on root mean squared error (RMSE), and mean absolute error (MAE) criteria...

The first chapter presents the theoretical background and detailed empirical studies.The next two chapters investigate what is the transmission channel of monetary policy.The second chapter pays particular attention to the puzzle first suggested by Meese and Rogoff (1983), who argued that a random walk model beats all the competing models based on root mean squared error (RMSE), and mean absolute error (MAE) criteria. Since this study, many efforts have been made to overturn their results using different econometric techniques. However, less attention has been paid to the sampling error and misspecification problem, which is the problem of omitted variables. To compensate for the weaknesses of the current literature, the second chapter provides empirical evidence that the Meese and Rogoff puzzle is attributable to both sampling error and misspecification problem. Extending the data from the post-Bretton Woods era to 2001:12 overturns Meese and Rogoff''s results, implying that a random walk model fails to outperform all the competing models for G-7 currencies based on RMSE and MAE criteria. In addition, testing a structural model after including the previously omitted variables shows that it not only beats a random walk, but also outperforms all the competing models, including interest rate parity, overshooting, and portfolio-balance models for such major currencies as the Deutsche mark, the Japanese yen, the Italian lira, and the pound sterling.The third chapter addresses two key questions: what are the main determinants of exchange rates, and through what transmission channel does monetary policy affect the exchange rate? Relying on different assumptions, including fiscal policy variable and paying particular attention to stock market channel I show that monetary policy affects the exchange rate through the stock market channel. I show that the oil price does not matter in driving the exchange rate behavior among G-7 countries. However, the results suggest that stock returns, especially dividend yields, play a crucial role in determining exchange rate behavior. Though, adding government expenditures, as a fiscal policy variable to the VAR specification suggests that fiscal policy has a greater influence than monetary policy on exchange rates in G-7 countries. In fact, monetary policy affects exchange rate behavior through the pass-through effects on stock market, especially through dividend yields, rather than through standard monetary aggregates or the federal fund rate. In addition I find that real factors like industrial production play a more crucial role than monetary aggregates in affecting exchange rates. The impulse response functions to different shocks reveal that there is no evidence of exchange rate overshooting. (Abstract shortened by UMI.)
