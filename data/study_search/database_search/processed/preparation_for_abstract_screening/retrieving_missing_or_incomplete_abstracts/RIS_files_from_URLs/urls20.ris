TI  - Heterogeneous labor market response to monetary policy: small versus large firms
AU  - Singh, Aarti

AU  - Zervou, Anastasia
AB  - We study the heterogeneous effects of monetary policy on the labor market of large and small firms in the United States. We uncover the following facts: (i) Expansionary monetary policy boosts employment and hiring growth in small firms more than in large firms; however, a monetary contraction shrinks small firms' employment and hiring growth less than in large firms. As a result, monetary policy has a countervailing effect on the employment concentration in large firms. (ii) There is an asymmetry in the effects of monetary contractions versus expansions with respect to firms' employment and hiring growth. Not accounting for such asymmetry leads to the fallacious conclusion that small firms respond more than large firms to monetary policy shocks. This asymmetry also reveals that contractionary monetary policy shocks have immediate effects on the labor market while the effects of expansionary shocks are slower to manifest. (iii) The response of employment is weaker than that of hiring, highlighting the importance of using labor market flows. (iv) The growth of earnings of new hires decreases similarly across large and small firms in contractions but reacts more for small firms in expansions. We use a heterogeneous firms model with a working capital constraint, an upward-sloping marginal cost curve, and a financial accelerator effect. We augment this model with the wage effect summarized in fact (iv) and demonstrate how the additional wage effect can explain the differential response of the hiring and employment growth of small and large firms of fact (i).

TI  - Who pays for disinflation? Disinflationary monetary policy and the distribution of income
AU  - Thorbecke, Willem
AB  - Using theoretical predictions, econometric results, and the example of the Volcker disinflation, Willem Thorbecke establishes that through disinflation's burden on the durable goods and construction industries, small firms, and low-wage workers and its benefits to bond market investors, it effects a redistribution of wealth from the poor to the rich. Because of this distributional consequence, he argues, engineering a disinflationary recession now to wring more inflation out of the economy would be inappropriate. On the contrary, with inflation as low as it is and with upward pressure on wages that could trigger a rise in inflation also low, now is the time for the Federal Reserve to let the economy grow - to seek policies that promote distributive justice and that help those individuals most at risk for shrinking income.

AB  - This paper documents the redistributive effects of monetary policy on labor market outcomes via the credit channel. For identification, we exploit matched administrative datasets in Portugal - employee-employer and credit registers - and monetary policy since the Eurozone creation in 1999. We find that softer monetary policy improves worker labor market outcomes (wages, hours worked and firm employment) more in small and young firms, which are more financially constrained. Within small and young firms, the wage effects accrue to incumbent workers, in line with the back-loaded wage mechanism. Consistent with the capital-skill complementarity mechanism, we document an increase in skill premium and show that financially constrained firms increase both physical and human capital investment by most. Our findings uncover a central role for both the firm-balance sheet and the bank lending channels of the monetary policy transmission to labor income inequality, with state-dependent effects that are substantially stronger during crisis times. Importantly, we do not find any redistributive effects for firms without bank credit.

AU  - Kuttner, Kenneth N.
T2  - Journal of Economic Perspectives
AB  - In November 2008, the Federal Reserve faced a deteriorating economy and a financial crisis. The federal funds rate had already been reduced to virtually zero. Thus, the Federal Reserve turned to unconventional monetary policies. Through “quantitative easing,” the Fed announced plans to buy mortgage-backed securities and debt issued by government-sponsored enterprises. Subsequent purchases would eventually lead to a five-fold expansion in the Fed’s balance sheet, from $900 billion to $4.5 trillion, and leave the Fed holding over 20 percent of all mortgage-backed securities and marketable Treasury debt. In addition, Fed policy statements in December 2008 began to include explicit references to the likely path of the federal funds interest rate, a policy that came to be known as “forward guidance.” The Fed ceased its direct asset purchases in late 2014. Starting in October 2017, it has allowed the balance sheet to shrink gradually as existing assets mature. From December 2015 through June 2018, the Fed has raised the federal funds interest rate seven times. Thus, the time is ripe to step back and ask whether the Fed’s unconventional policies had the intended expansionary effects—and by extension, whether the Fed should use them in the future.

AB  - Purpose This paper aims to explore Istisna’a as a tool of monetary policy (MP) and examines its effectiveness in achieving full employment income and price stability. Design/methodology/approach This paper uses Istisna’a as a tool of MP and examines its effects on key macroeconomic variables on purely theoretical ground. The effectiveness and the impact of Istisna’a-based MP is examined by using aggregate output and aggregate expenditure model, embedded with Islamic economic principles, including zakat function. Findings Istisna’a-based MP immediately creates well paid jobs, positively contributes and expands the size of the manufacturing sector, increases capital per person employed, labor productivity and thus increases output, employment and promotes industrialization. Increase in the size of manufacturing sector will not only increase manufactured value-added exports but also cut high valued manufactured imports and thus increases positive trade balance and eventually reduces trade deficits. Increase in labor productivity will improve the standard of living, and eventually the economy will yield sustainable high growth rates, full employment and prosperity. Originality/value This is probably one of the first attempt to systematically develop the Istisna’a-based MP with detailed MP transmission mechanism. This new contribution in the field of Islamic MP will unveil the horizon of sustainable economic growth, creation of well paid jobs, expansion of manufacturing sector, rapid industrialization and the increase in capital per person employed across the economy, and eventually Istisna’a-based MP will be one of the most effective tool of MP for transforming an economy into a relatively higher and sophisticated stages which will eventually promote sustainable development.

TI  - Wage Bargaining and Monetary Policy in a Kaleckian Monetary Distribution and Growth Model: Trying to Make Sense of the NAIRU
AU  - Hein, Eckhard
T2  - European Journal of Economics and Economic Policies: Intervention
AB  - In a Kaleckian monetary distribution and growth model with conflict inflation we assess the role of a Non-Accelerating Inflation Rate of Unemployment (NAIRU). The short-run stability of a NAIRU is examined taking into account real debt effects of accelerating and decelerating inflation, and the short-run effectiveness of monetary policy interventions applying the interest rate tool is analysed. The problem of long-run endogeneity of the NAIRU is addressed integrating the long-run distribution effects of monetary policies' real interest rate variations into the model. It is concluded that monetary policy interventions in order to stabilise inflation are either unnecessary or costly in terms of employment in the short run. In the long run, these policies bear the risk of continuously increasing the NAIRU in order to keep inflation under control, which yields a horizontal long-run Phillips curve and latent stagflation. Instead of relying on monetary policies, the cause of inflation should be directly addressed and wage bargaining co-ordination should be applied as an appropriate tool.

AB  - We study the impact of monetary policy on income and wealth distributions in a small open economy. To do so, we use household-level registry and survey data from Finland, a small member of a monetary union. This setup allows us to circumvent endogeneity issues and thus helps achieve causal interpretation. We find that expansionary monetary shocks stimulate economic activity, earnings, and asset prices, while barely affecting income and wealth inequality. The reduction in unemployment mostly benefits households in lower income quintiles, where the initial rate of unemployment is high. Households in upper income quintiles, where the rate of employment is higher, benefit relatively more from higher wages. Higher house prices increase the net wealth of all homeowners. However, due to a leverage effect, households with large mortgages located in the lower net wealth quintiles benefit most. Rising stock prices, in turn, benefit mainly households in the top net wealth quintile. Overall, these different channels have counteracting effects on income and wealth inequality.

AB  - Using micro-data covering private and public UK firms, we document heterogeneous responses to monetary policy; finding that employment at younger, more-levered firms is most sensitive. This heterogeneity is consistent with firm-level financial constraints. To show this, we exploit the fact that the homes of company directors are a key source of corporate collateral, but many directors live in a different region to their firm, allowing specifications controlling for demand. Younger, more-levered firms exposed to collateral fluctuations drive the employment response, showing a residential collateral channel in the transmission of monetary policy to firms.

AB  - We provide new evidence on how monetary policy affects investment and firm finance in the United States and the United Kingdom. Younger firms paying no dividends exhibit the largest and most significant change in capital expenditure - even after conditioning on size, asset growth, Tobin's Q, leverage or liquidity - and drive the response of aggregate investment. Older companies, in contrast, hardly react at all. After a monetary policy tightening, net worth falls considerably for all firms but borrowing declines only for younger non-dividend payers, as their external finance is mostly exposed to asset value fluctuations. Conversely, cash flows change less markedly and more homogeneously across groups. Our findings highlight the role of firm finance and financial frictions in amplifying the effects of monetary policy on investment.

AB  - This paper investigates the impact of unconventional monetary policy on firm financial constraints using the maturity extension program (MEP). Consistent with bond market segmentation and limits to arbitrage, around the MEP's announcement, stock prices rose for those firms more dependent on longer-term debt. These firms also issued more long-term debt during the MEP and expanded employment and investment. There is also evidence of “reach for yield” behavior, as the demand for riskier corporate debt also increased. Our results suggest that unconventional monetary policy might have relaxed financial constraints for some firms by inducing gap-filling behavior and affecting bond market risk premia.

AB  - In this paper we analyse the effects of informal labour markets on the dynamics of inflation and on the transmission of aggregate demand and supply shocks. In doing so, we incorporate the informal sector in a modified New Keynesian model with labour market frictions as in the Diamond-Mortensen-Pissarides model. Our main results show that the informal economy generates a "buffer" effect that diminishes the pressure of demand shocks on aggregate wages and inflation. Finding that is consistent with the empirical literature on the e¤ects of informal labour markets in business cycle fluctuations. This result implies that in economies with large informal labour markets the interest rate channel of monetary policy is relatively weaker. Furthermore, the model produces cyclical flows from informal to formal employment consistent with the data.

T2  - Working Papers
AB  - Most previous empirical studies on the effects of monetary policy on employment fail to take care of the "price puzzle," concluding that the estimated response of inflation is positive to the contractionary monetary policy shock. This paper aims to resolve this problem by using a factor augmented vector autoregressive (FAVAR) model suggested by Bernanke et al. (2005). Additionally, a small-open economy structure is imposed on the FAVAR model to separately identify the domestic and foreign interest rate shocks. The results suggest that a raise in the key rate by the Bank of Korea decreases the employment-to-population ratio (EPR) of young male workers while other worker groups do not respond in a similar fashion. This implies that a labor demand channel of monetary policy works only in the young male workers market. This finding is also in concord with the fact that young workers confront a relatively high unemployment rate compared to other population groups since a larger reserve labor force means a bigger sensitivity to a change in labor demand change.

AU  - Onoh, Uloma Adonye
AB  - The research looks at the monetary policy instruments employed by the Nigerian monetary authorities and their effects on turnover ratio of commercial banks in Nigeria. The objective of the research was to examine the effects of monetary policy instruments-money supply, liquidity ratio, monetary policy rate, and cash reserve ratio- on commercial banks turnover ratio in an attempt at finding out the true nature and the extent monetary policy instruments have been successful in impacting on banking performance in Nigeria. To give the reader a more informed knowledge on the area, the conceptual, theoretical and empirical literature was examined. The methodology used the ordinary least square (OLS) since it enabled the researcher to capture the essence of the work effectively in addition to its high level of simplicity and global acceptability. Moreover, a 5% confidence level is adopted for the study. OLS became imperative for use in this work as the theoretical foundation for this procedure is well highlighted in many articles of Akanbi & Ajagbe (2012), Amassoma, Wosa & Olaiya (2011); Ekpung, Udude & Uwalaka (2015); Okoye & Udeh (2009), & Olokoyo (2012). The analysis done showed that monetary policy had some level of effect on bank performance proxied by Turnover rate (TOR), Bank Assets (BAS) and Loan and Advances (LADV). It is equally indicative of the fact that the relationship is instrument sensitive, i.e, some monetary policy tools work better on some bank performance indexes while such may not work on some other ones.

AB  - In this article, the link between monetary policy and inequality is investigated using the vector auto regression based impulse response functions. The study was motivated by persistent high income inequality in South Africa and the COVID-19 pandemic has renewed the debate on the links between monetary policy and inequality. South African annual time series data from 1990 to 2021 was used to examine the relationship between monetary policy and inequality. The impulse response functions show that the overall income distribution is briefly improved following a monetary policy shock. The findings suggest a fluctuating effect of monetary policy on inequality of which after period six a shock to monetary policy has no effect to inequality since the relationship reaches a stable state. The policy implication is the countercyclical use of monetary policy to reduce inequality is only effective in the early phases and in the long term the effect of monetary policy on inequality is reduced. The policy suggestion is that monetary policy alone cannot tackle inequality in an economy with other structural challenges that are outside of the monetary system. Hence policy coordination between monetary policy and fiscal policy is essential.

AB  - Should central banks take more account of ethical distributional and environmental concerns in the design and implementation of the wider monetary policy toolkit they have been using in the past decade? Although the scope to influence a range of objectives is more limited than is often supposed, and while it is vital to not derail monetary policy from its core purposes, central bank mandates justify paying more attention to such broad issues, especially if policy choices have a significant potential impact. Carefully managed steps in this direction could actually strengthen central bank independence while making some contribution to improving the effectiveness of public policy on these matters.

AB  - This paper investigates the interactions between stock market fluctuations and monetary policy within a DSGE model for the U.S. economy. First, we design a framework in which fluctuations in households financial wealth are allowed—but not necessarily required—to exert an impact on current consumption. This is due to the interaction, in the financial markets, of long-time traders holding wealth accumulated over time with newcomers holding no wealth at all. Importantly, we introduce nominal wage stickiness to induce pro-cyclicality in real dividends. Additional nominal and real frictions are modeled to capture the pervasive macroeconomic persistence of the observables employed to estimate our model. We fit our model to post-WWII U.S. data, and report three main results. First, the data strongly support a significant role of stock prices in affecting real activity and the business cycle. Second, our estimates also identify a significant and counteractive response of the Fed to stock-price fluctuations. Third, we derive from our model a microfounded measure of financial slack, the “stock-price gap”, which we then contrast to alternative ones, currently used in empirical studies, to assess the properties of the latter to capture the dynamic and cyclical implications of our DSGE model. The behavior of our “stock-price gap” is consistent with the episodes of stock-market booms and busts occurred in the post-WWII, as reported by independent analyses, and closely correlates with the current financial meltdown. Typically employed proxies of financial slack such as detrended log-indexes or growth rates show limited capabilities of capturing the implications of our model-consistent index of financial stress. Cyclical properties of the model as well as counterfactuals regarding shocks to our measure of financial slackness and monetary policy shocks are also proposed.

AU  - Ryoo, Soon

AB  - This paper examines the implications of different monetary and fiscal policy rules in an economy characterized by Harrodian instability. We show that (1) a monetary rule along Taylor lines can be stabilizing for low debt ratios but becomes de-stabilizing if the debt ratio exceeds a certain threshold, (2) a ‘Keynesian’ fiscal policy rule can stabilize the economy at full employment, (3) a fiscal ‘austerity’ rule that links fiscal parameters to deviations from a target debt ratio fails to adjust the ‘warranted’ to the ‘natural’ growth rate and destabilizes the warranted path and (4) instability may arise from a combination of fiscal and monetary policy rules which separately would stabilize the system.

TI  - Unconventional monetary policy and inequality: is Japan unique?
AU  - Saiki, Ayako
AU  - Frost, Jon
T2  - Applied Economics
AB  - Unconventional monetary policy (UMP) influences inequality through two channels that work in opposite directions – a labour market channel (more employment, higher wages) and a financial market channel (higher asset prices). In an earlier paper, covering UMP through 2014, we found that UMP in Japan had contributed to greater income inequality through its effects on asset prices. With a longer time period, a richer dataset including labour market data, and a structural vector autoregression (SVAR) we confirm that these results continue to hold, and investigate why UMP’s impact on inequality in Japan differs from some other countries. We argue that Japanese structural issues may mute the labour market channel, especially: (i) labour market rigidity; and (ii) the large share of the population that is older than 65 years old or retired. The older cohort’s capital gains and dividends are re-saved in other financial assets, instead of being consumed or used for starting businesses. At the same time, wages have not increased despite the severe labour shortage, due to the frictions in Japan’s labour market. We conclude that these factors may make the inequality created by UMP in Japan unique by international comparison.

TI  - Flexible Exchange Rates and Employment Policy
AU  - Mundell, Robert
T2  - Canadian Journal of Economics and Political Science/Revue canadienne de economiques et science politique
AB  - The theory of employment that grew out of the Great Depression was not long in influencing government policy-makers and revolutionizing older concepts of fiscal policy. The most important of Keynes's practical lessons, that policies which promote investment and exports and inhibit saving and imports increase employment and output, has now hardened into a dogma and filtered down into almost all the elementary textbooks. The lesson, by and large, was a good one, but the dogma presents the danger that the lesson might be uncritically applied in situations where other government policies render it invalid. This paper is concerned with the most important exception to the rule.The mercantilist element in Keynesian policies is definitely inapplicable to countries whose central banks do not peg the price of foreign exchange or gold. Tariffs, trade controls, and export subsidies are likely to worsen employment and output in all those situations in which, with a fixed exchange rate, they would improve employment and output. Moreover, if exchange rates are flexible, an increase in investment or government spending, and a reduction in saving or taxation, will have a substantially different effect on employment than that predicted by the traditional foreign trade multiplier. The reason lies in the fact that equilibrium in the balance of payments is automatically maintained by variations in the price of foreign exchange.

AB  - This paper analyzes the impact of conventional and unconventional monetary policy on income inequality in Japan, using hitherto unexplored data from the Japan Household Panel Survey. Empirical evidence shows that expansionary monetary policy in Japan has contributed to diminishing the gender pay gap through an increase in working time of women relative to men, but also to increasing the education pay gap. These effects may have materialized via the aggregate demand channel and the labour productivity channel. In contrast, expansionary monetary policy has had no significant impact on the development of the age pay gap.

AB  - We characterize optimal monetary policy in response to asymmetric shocks that shift demand from one sector to another, a condition arguably faced by many economies emerging from the Covid-19 crisis. We show that the asymmetry manifests itself as an endogenous cost-push shock, breaking divine coincidence, and resulting in inflation optimally exceeding its target despite elevated unemployment. In fact, there is no simple, possibly re-weighted, inflation index that can be used as the optimal target. When labor is mobile between sectors, monetary easing can have the additional benefit of inducing faster reallocation, by producing wage increases in the expanding sector.

AB  - In this chapter, the authors adopt a Modern Monetary Theory lens and argue that the setting of interest rates should be subject to rules, such as a target policy rate, as opposed to central bank discretion. A number of theoretical arguments are advanced as to why reliance on monetary policy to achieve full employment and price stability is ill-advised. Thus monetary policy would need to be complemented by the fiscal policy which has stronger and more predictable short-term effects on the macroeconomy. The authors advocate a job guarantee, along with infrastructure spending, which address the challenges associated with achieving and maintaining full employment and price stability.

AB  - Abstract. In this paper we study the effects of monetary policies on employment, capital accumulation, consumption, and the term structure of interest rates in a cash-in-advance economy, where money is required for consumption expenditures. Monetary policy involves targeting the inflation rate. The detailed dynamics of the model are fully worked out. As no numerical analysis is involved, we are able to identify very clearly the different channels through which monetary policy will impinge on the important macroeconomic variables. The model is also used to discuss the ‘Great Canadian Slump.’ JEL Classification: E52 and E43

AU  - Kurt, Ezgi
AB  - This paper documents firm-level evidence on the asymmetric effects of monetary policy in the US. Focusing on firm-level data from 1980q3 to 2016q2, I find that monetary contractions triple the effects of monetary expansions on firms’ employment, investment rate, and sales. Furthermore, I examine the role of alternative financial characteristics in propagating these asymmetric effects. My findings show a higher level of asymmetry for firms with a small size, low leverage, high liq- uidity, or a no-dividend paying status. These results provide evidence that financial characteristics play a role in propagating the asymmetric effects of monetary policy.

We develop a Post-Keynesian conflicting-claims model that explicitly incorporates the impact of workers' and firms' financial commitments on distribution conflict and inflation. We propose different versions of the short-run Phillips curve for a debt-financed economy. We explore the impact of monetary policy on the shape and the position of the Phillips curve. We show that the inflation effects of monetary policy cannot be identified without prior knowledge about the institutional and financial structures of the economy, as well as about borrowers' desired margins of safety.

AB  - The importance of money in economic life has made policy makers and other relevant stakeholders to accord special recognition to the conduct of monetary policy. This study investigated the relationship that exists between monetary policy instruments and Deposit Money Banks Loans and Advances in Nigeria. An annual time series data covering a period of 36 years from 1981-2016 were sourced from Central Bank of Nigeria and used for the study. The relationship between monetary policy and credit creation of Deposit Money Banks was captured by monetary policy variables and structural changes in monetary policy. The study employed Toda and Yamamoto granger non-causality model to examine the relationship existing between Deposit Money Banks loan and advances and monetary policy variables in Nigeria. The findings revealed that structural changes in monetary policy system exerted positive significant impact on loan and advances of Deposit Money Banks in Nigeria. Findings also revealed bidirectional relationship existing between MPR and loan and advances of Deposit Money Banks in Nigeria. Precisely, MPR proved to be a significant variable which causes Deposit Money Bank loans and advances in Nigeria. The other explanatory variables; broad money supply(LM2),liquidity ratio (LR), inflation rate (IFR) and cash reserve ratio (CRR) does not granger cause loan and advances of Deposit Money Banks in Nigeria within the study period. The study concluded that the structural change in monetary policy system and monetary policy rate have significant impact on loan and advances of deposit money banks in Nigeria .Hence, the study recommended that monetary authority should formulate policies that will stabilize interest rate so as to boost the investors’confidence.

AB  - We quantify the short-term effects of both non-systematic and systematic monetary policy on the income and wealth distribution in Norway, and measure the relative importance of the various channels. An expansionary monetary policy shock is found to disproportionally benefit the young as well as households with middle to lower income and wealth, and it reduces inequality in disposable income and wealth. The key channel for disposable income is the savings redistribution channel, whereby households with high debt-to-income ratios gain relatively more from a lower interest rate. Because of the high home ownership rate in Norway, most households gain from higher house prices, but the middle and lower part of the distribution gain relatively more as they are more indebted. We also find that systematic monetary policy, aimed at stabilizing cyclical fluctuations in output and inflation, also tends to stabilize income and wealth inequality.

AB  - This paper provides new evidence on the channels of monetary policy transmission combining 9 million observations on firm level investment and high-frequency identified monetary policy shocks. We show that the reaction of firms’ investment to a monetary policy shock is heterogeneous along dimensions that correspond to the two main channels of monetary policy transmission. First, we show that young firms are more sensitive to monetary policy shocks and that high leverage amplifies the effects, supporting the existence of a credit channel of monetary policy. Second, we document large cross-sectional heterogeneity related to the industry the firm operates in. We find that firms producing durable goods react more than others, which is consistent with traditional interest rate channel effects of monetary policy. Furthermore, this sectoral effect is longer lived. In line with the demand effects of the interest rate channel, we also provide evidence that sales growth of durables producing firms reacts stronger to a monetary policy shock.

AB  - Financial deregulation is widely understood to have important economic benefits for microeconomic reasons. Since Adam Smith, economists have provided arguments and evidence that unfettered private markets yield outcomes that are superior to public sector alternatives. But financial regulations - specific rules and overall structures - are sometimes justified on macroeconomic grounds. This paper analyzes the need for financial regulations in the implementation of central bank policy. Dividing the actions of the Federal Reserve into monetary and banking policy, we find that financial regulations cannot readily be rationalized on the basis of macroeconomic benefits.

AU  - Thorbecke, Willem
T2  - Journal of Policy Modeling
AB  - There are solid theoretical reasons, based on concepts such as “ladder effects”, to believe that disinflationary monetary policy disproportionately burdens low-income individuals. Minority groups in the U.S. tend to have lower incomes than whites. An implication of this wage gap is that the burden of contractionary monetary policy should fall on minorities. This paper uses identified vector autoregressions (VARs), narrative evidence, and the Romer and Romer [Romer, C., & Romer, D. (1989). Does monetary policy matters? A new test in the spirit of Friedman and Schwartz. NBER Macroeconomic Annual, 4, 121–170.] approach to investigate whether this is so. The results indicate that disinflationary monetary policy increases unemployment among minorities approximately twice as much as it does among whites. The Federal Reserve (Fed) should take account of these effects when considering implementing disinflationary policy.

AB  - We analyze the effect of monetary policy on yield spreads between corporate bonds with different credit ratings over the business cycle. We use futures contracts to distinguish between expected and unexpected changes in the Fed funds target rate and several indicators to distinguish between different phases of the business cycle. In line with the predictions of imperfect capital market theories, we find that yields on corporate bonds with low credit ratings widen (narrow) with respect to those with high credit ratings following an unexpected increase (decrease) in the Fed funds target rate during recession periods. Several tests suggest that our results are robust to outliers, potential endogeneity problems, empirical specification, control variables, countercyclical risk premium in futures, and alternative definitions of credit spreads and economic conditions.

We use the European Central Bank’s interest-rate cuts to below zero in mid-2014 and credit-registry data from Germany (euro-area core) and Portugal (euro-area periphery). We provide a simple model of a bank with costly external ﬁnancing, risk taking, and a zero lower bound (ZLB) on deposit rates. We exploit the core-periphery variation in the distance to the ZLB alongside cross-sectional heterogeneity in banks’ balance sheets to show when and how the external-ﬁnancing constraint and risk taking matter for the transmission mechanism.

TI  - Reactions of stock market to monetary policy shocks during the global financial crisis: The Nigerian case
AU  - Aliyu, Shehu U. R.
T2  - CBN Journal of Applied Statistics
AB  - This paper seeks to assess the reactions of Nigeria's stock market to monetary policy innovations during the period of global financial crisis on the basis of monthly data over the period January, 2007 to August, 2011. In particular, stock market return was regressed against major monetary policy instruments; money stock (M1, and M2) and monetary policy rate (MPR). The theoretical basis for the paper stems from the works of new classical macroeconomics and rational expectation hypothesis (REH). Lucas (1972) postulated that only the unanticipated monetary shock influences real economic activity. Using the GARCH by developed Engle and Bollerslev (1986) and EGARCH by Nelson (1991) methodologies, the paper empirically assessed the impact monetary policy innovations exerts on stock returns in the Nigeria's Stock Exchange (NSE) market during the period of the crisis. Results from the empirical analysis revealed that the unaticipated component of policy innovations on M2 and MPR exerts distabilizing effect on NSE's returns, whereas the anticipated component does not. This lends support to the REH argument for the Nigerian stock market. The pqper strongly recommends realistic and timely policy pronouncements by the MPC to achieve stability in the market.

TI  - Monetary Policy and Credit Delivery in Commercial Banks – Evidence from Nigeria
AU  - Onoh, John Okey
AB  - The study embarked on finding out the effect and to what extent monetary policy instruments on credit delivery by banks. The problem of study is that high toxic assets remains high despite the policies placed over time thus questioning the effect of monetary policy on banks asset quality and returns. The objective of study in trying to evaluate the factors responsible for bank performance in Nigeria the research objective is to determine the level of effect of monetary policy-money supply, liquidity ratio; cash reserve ratio and monetary police rate on commercial banks credit delivery. The literature review contains the conceptual, theoretical and empirical review of the area of study. In the methodology of study, the data utilized include Cash Reserve Ratio (CRR), Turnover ratio, Liquidity ratio, Monetary Policy Rate (MPR), Money Supply (MS), Bank Assets and Loans and Advances (TLA). The study also used the ordinary least square (OLS) since it enabled the researcher to capture the essence of the work effectively in addition to its high level of simplicity and global acceptability. Moreover, a 5% confidence level is adopted for the study. The MPR, MSP and CRR have positive relationship with LADV. That is, the higher the MPR, MSP and CRR, the higher the LADV. However, LQR has negative relationship with LADV.

AB  - This paper examines the adjustment of inventories by firms in the United Kingdom and Spain, which have two quite different financial systems. A widely held view is that a key channel for monetary policy is through the influencing of inventory accumulation. Using a large company-level panel data-set for both countries, significant effects associated with borrowing costs on inventories are estimated. Financial effects associated with liquidity and the borrowing ratio are estimated to be stronger in the UK than in Spain. Since the Spanish financial system is bank-based, while that of the UK is market-based, this is interpreted as contrary to the Bank Dependence Hypothesis.

AU  - Sastry, Karthik
AB  - Using a model of monetary policymaking with belief distortions, I propose tests to distinguish among three leading explanations for disagreement between markets and central banks: asymmetric information, different beliefs about the monetary rule, and different confidence in public signals. Implementing these tests in US data, I find that bad macroeconomic news predicts market over-estimation of both interest rates and employment relative to realizations and Federal-Reserve forecasts. I show that different confidence in public signals is necessary to explain these findings. Quantitatively, this mechanism significantly dampens market beliefs’ responsiveness to fundamentals. Central-bank signaling about fundamentals, by contrast, has much smaller effects.

The study employed three commercial banks in the Nigeria financial system, that is, the first generation banks. The employed data run through 1992 to 1999 and this was collected through various issues of central bank of Nigeria statistical bulletin and analysed with the use of regression model. The results showed net profit, liquidity ratio, cash ratio and interest rate on savings which confirms to the prior expectation. This could be further explained with the regression estimate whereby an increase in interest rate will leads to a decrease in the lending rate while liquidity ratio and cash ratio were statistically significant to the profit of the selected banks.

TI  - Monetary policy and economic growth nexus in Nigeria
AU  - Adeagbo, Mathew Oluwaseun
T2  - Ianna Journal of Interdisciplinary Studies
AB  - Background: The extent to which monetary policies influenced macroeconomic variables especially price stability and ultimately economic growth has been a theme of discussion among scholars over the years, with no solid position. This non-definite stand thus beckons for more research on the issue.
Objective: This study sought to examine the effect of monetary policy on economic growth in Nigeria.
Methodology: Annual data sourced from Central Bank of Nigeria Statistical Bulletin covering the period 1971 to 2018. The data collected were analyzed using Ordinary Least Square method. The study also conducted the unit root and cointegration test to ascertain the fitness of the model.
Result: Long-run relationship exists among the variables and that some explanatory variables (Monetary policy rate, Interest rate, Investment to productive sector) presents a positive but non-significant effect on economic growth while real exchange rate has a negative impact on economic growth in Nigeria. However, monetary supply, which is another explanatory variable has a positive significant effect on economic growth.
Conclusion: On the overall, monetary policy is found to explain about 89% of the changes in economic growth in Nigeria.
Unique contribution: The study includes monetary policy rate which serves as the main tool of monetary policy targets and as well use GDP growth rate which is believed to be an adequate measure of economic growth as against ordinary GDP. This study also replaced external reserves and output of industrial production with investment since investment is theoretically postulated to have a direct influence from interest rates (both lending and deposit), which CBN monetary policy rates have a direct influence on.
Key Recommendation: The study recommends that government and relevant monetary authorities should make financial sector less volatile and ensure the effective monitoring of money supply levels, among others.

T2  - Handbook on the International Political Economy of Gender
AB  - The chapter focuses on the shift to unconventional monetary policies of central banks since the financial crisis of 2007/08, arguing that these policies have increased the private wealth of predominantly males resulting in highly unequal distributional outcomes. Quantitative Easing has increased the values of assets (stocks, bonds, mutual funds), and thus benefited mostly those who own risky investments, have higher education, higher income and inherited wealth. What is new is that the macroeconomic shift to a finance-dominated capitalism (financialization) has changed the parameters of how monetary policies set by the central banks have shaped asymmetric distributional outcomes. Not only has the disciplinary power and dominance of financialization increased inequality, central bank monetary policies have inadvertently led to an unacceptable structure of gendered inequality and social exclusion.

AB  - We analyze a monetary policy quasi-experiment in Sweden from 2010–2011, when the Riksbank raised the interest rate substantially as the economy recovered from the Great Recession. We argue that this tightening was a large, credible, and partially unexpected deviation from the historical policy rule. Using administrative micro data, we explore how this shock affected the labor market. We ﬁnd that unemployment increased broadly, not just at interest-rate sensitive ﬁrms, but with large differences across workers within ﬁrms. Moreover, we ﬁnd that labor market rigidities ampliﬁed the effects, as sectors with more rigid wage contracts saw larger increases in unemployment.

TI  - Oil Shocks and Aggregate Macroeconomic Behavior: The Role of Monetary Policy
AU  - Herrera, Ana Maria
AU  - Hamilton, James D.
AB  - A recent paper by Bernanke, Gertler and Watson (1997) suggests that monetary policy could be used to eliminate any recessionary consequences of an oil price shock. This paper challenges that conclusion on two grounds. First, we question whether the Federal Reserve actually has the power to implement such a policy; for example, we consider it unlikely that additional money creation would have succeeded in reducing the Fed funds rate by 900 basis points relative to the values seen in 1974. Second, we point out that the size of the effect that Bernanke, Gertler and Watson attribute to oil shocks is substantially smaller than that reported by other researchers, primarily due to their choice of a shorter lag length than used by other researchers. We offer evidence in favor of the longer lag length employed by previous research, and show that, under this specification, even the aggressive Federal Reserve policies proposed would not have succeeded in averting a downturn.

AB  - The recent financial crisis has stimulated theoretical and empirical research on the propagation mechanisms underlying business cycles, in particular on the role of financial frictions. Many issues concerning the interactions between banking and monetary policy forced policy makers to redefine economic policies, and motivated macroeconomists to focus on the implications of financial intermediation constraints for asset price fluctuations, the behavior of non-financial firms, households, governments and in turn for real macroeconomic performance. This paper surveys research on the role of financial intermediaries and financial frictions in the transmission of monetary policy and discusses how to design both the new banking regulatory and supervisory structures and monetary policy in order to stabilize the economy. It also serves as an introduction to this special issue.

T2  - Surveys of Economic Theory: Volume I Money, Interest, and Welfare
AB  - In order to isolate a field of study clearly enough demarcated to be usefully surveyed, it is necessary to define monetary theory as comprising theories concerning the influence of the quantity of money in the economic system, and monetary policy as policy employing the central bank’s control of the supply of money as an instrument for achieving the objectives of general economic policy. In surveying the field thus narrowly defined fourteen years ago, Henry Villard [123] began by remarking on the relative decline in the significance attached to it as compared with the offshoot fields of business cycle and fiscal (income and employment) theory, a decline related to the experience of the 1930’s, the intellectual impact of Keynes’s General Theory [66], and the inhibiting effects of the wartime expansion of public debt on monetary policy. While this division of labor has continued, and has indeed been accentuated by the emergence of the cross-cutting field of economic growth and development as an area of specialization, the field of money has been increasingly active and has received increasing attention in the past fourteen years.

AU  - Gambacorta, Leonardo
AU  - Murcia, Andrés
AB  - This paper summarises the results of a joint research project by eight central banks in the Americas region to evaluate the effectiveness of macroprudential tools and their interaction with monetary policy. In particular, using meta-analysis techniques, we summarise the results for five Latin American countries (Argentina, Brazil, Colombia, Mexico and Peru) that use confidential bank-loan data. The use of granular credit registry data helps us to disentangle loan demand from loan supply effects without making strong assumptions. Results from another three countries (Canada, Chile and the United States) corroborate the analysis using data for credit origination and borrower characteristics. The main conclusions are that (i) macroprudential policies have been quite effective in stabilising credit cycles. The propagation of the effects to credit growth is more rapid (they materialise after one quarter) for policies aimed at curbing the cycle than for policies aimed at fostering resilience (which take effect within a year); and (ii) macroprudential tools have a greater effect on credit growth when reinforced by the use of monetary policy to push in the same direction.

TI  - STRATEGIC MONETARY POLICY WITH NON-ATOMISTIC WAGE-SETTERS: A CASE FOR NON-NEUTRALITY
AU  - Lippi, Francesco
AB  - The literature on monetary policy games establishes that policy-makers’
attempts to boost employment above the ‘natural' rate are futile and result in
an inflationary bias when wage-setters have rational expectations and the
policy-maker cannot precommit. This implies that a variation of the policymaker's degree of inflation aversion does not have a systematic effect on the
employment level.
This Paper shows that this last neutrality result hinges crucially on the
assumption that wage-setters are atomistic. In the presence of non-atomistic
agents, who set nominal wages and have monopolistic power, the policymaker's inflation aversion may have a systematic effect on equilibrium
employment even if agents have rational expectations and complete
information. The model is used to re-assess the welfare implications of
monetary policy delegation to a ‘conservative' central bank.

AU  - Aiyar, Shekhar S.
AU  - Calomiris, Charles W.
AU  - Wieladek, Tomasz
AB  - We use data on UK banks’ minimum capital requirements to study the interaction of monetary policy and capital requirement regulation. UK banks were subject to both time-varying capital requirements and changes in interest rate policy. Tightening of either capital requirements or monetary policy reduces the supply of lending. Lending by large banks reacts substantially to capital requirement changes, but not to monetary policy changes. Lending by small banks reacts to both. There is little evidence of interaction between these two policy instruments. The differences in the responses of small and large banks, and the lack of interaction between capital requirement changes and monetary policy, have important policy implications. Our results confirm the theoretical consensus view that monetary policy should focus on price stability objectives and that capital requirement changes are a more effective tool to achieve financial stability objectives related to loan supply. We also identify important distributional consequences within the financial system of these two policy instruments. Finally, our findings do not corroborate theoretical models that raise concerns about complex interactions between monetary policy and macroprudential variation in capital requirements.

AU  - Lartey, Lawrencia
AB  - This study was undertaken to determine the pass through effect of the Central bank’s monetary policy rate on commercial banks’ lending rates. Specifically, the study sought to ascertain the short and long run relationship between these variables of interest. It employed monthly time series data spanning from 2002 to 2017 which was sourced mainly from the World Development Indicator (WDI) and Bank of Ghana (BOG). Autoregressive Distributed Lag Model (ARDL) was the estimation technique used for analyzing the data. Estimates from the Augmented Dicker- Fuller (ADF) and Phillips-Perron (PP) unit root test showed that the variables were all integrated of order one (1).
The findings found that there is a positive relationship between average lending rates and Monetary Policy Rate (MPR). MPR was significant in both the long and short run and had a large marginal effect on lending rates compared to all the other variables. However, in the short run the speed of adjustment was relatively slow. This implied a more rigid downward adjustment of average lending rate to changes in all the variables. Money supply in the economy denoted by M2+ was negatively related to average lending rates. Treasury bill rate was the only variable which was negatively insignificant in the short run. Based on the above findings the study recommends appropriate measures to be implemented to assist in fully developing the financial markets.

Achieving the Federal Reserve’s goals of full employment and price stability promotes financial stability. A key concern, however, is that with a low equilibrium real interest rate, a low policy rate will be necessary, and in turn, these low rates may contribute to an increase in financial system vulnerabilities. Our analysis suggests that there are typically significant macroeconomic and financial stability benefits of using these tools and strategies, but there are plausible situations in which financial vulnerabilities are such that it would be desirable to limit their use. A clear communications strategy can help minimize financial vulnerabilities. Should vulnerabilities arise, they are often best addressed with macroprudential tools.

AB  - Rises in U.S. interest rates are often thought to generate adverse spillovers to emerging market economies (EMEs). We show that what appears to be bad news for EMEs might actually be good news, or at least not-so-bad news, depending on the source of the rise in U.S. interest rates. We present evidence that higher U.S. interest rates stemming from stronger U.S. growth generate only modest spillovers, while those stemming from a more hawkish Fed policy stance or inflationary pressures can lead to significant tightening of EME financial conditions. Our identification of the sources of U.S. rate changes is based on high-frequency moves in U.S. Treasury yields and stock prices around FOMC announcements and U.S. employment report releases. We interpret positive comovements of stocks and interest rates around these events as growth shocks and negative comovements as monetary shocks, and estimate the effect of these shocks on emerging market asset prices. For economies with greater macroeconomic vulnerabilities, the difference between the impact of monetary and growth shocks is magnified. In fact, for EMEs with very low levels of vulnerability, a growth-driven rise in U.S. interest rates may even ease financial conditions in some markets.

T2  - Business Economics
AB  - The small business sector of the economy accounts for half of private gross domestic product and well over half of private sector employment. Little is known about how these firms and the banks that serve them are affected by changes in monetary policy. Using data from the monthly surveys of the members of the National Federation of Independent Business, the impact of unexpected (between meeting) Federal Reserve announcements on owner expectations and hiring and spending plans are examined. Using interviews filled out during the month, “before” and “after” groups are analyzed to assess the impact of Federal Reserve announcements on firm behavior. Narrowing the analysis period to just days before and after Federal Reserve announcements permits the assessment of owner responses uncontaminated by other events. Changes in owner expectations and spending and hiring plans are shown to be translated into subsequent changes in actual spending and hiring that are often the opposite of what is suggested by conventional economic theory. Firms that do not use debt respond in the same way as those regularly active in credit markets. The results provide additional insight and richness to our understanding of the transmission channels through which monetary policy impacts the real economy.

AB  - This paper examines how banking marketization affects the transmission of monetary policy through the bank lending channel, and tests whether the relationship between banking marketization and the transmission of monetary policy changes across heterogeneous banks. Our results suggest that as the degree of banking marketization increases, China’s monetary policy transmission through the bank lending channel weakens, and this works particularly for large, high profitability, and high capitalization banks. To improve the effectiveness of the monetary policy, authorities need to consider reducing dependency on the lending channel of monetary policy transmission and diversifying the monetary policy instruments.

TI  - EBSCOhost | 161334977 | Effects of Monetary Policy on Financial Inclusion: An Empirical Evidence from Nigeria.
AB  - The study conducted an empirical analysis on the effects of monetary policy on financial inclusion in Nigeria from 1985 to 2019. The study employed time series research design and data were collected from the secondary source via CBN statistical bulletin. The study used autoregressive distance lag(ARDL) to achieve the objective of the study. The findings indicated that lending rate has a negative and insignificant effect on number of bank branches; money supply has a positive effect but insignificant effect on credit to SMEs; and liquidity ratio has a positive but insignificant effect on bank demand deposit. Therefore, the study concluded that monetary policy does not have significant effect on financial inclusion in Nigeria from 1985 to 2019. The study recommended that Central Bank of Nigeria as a monetary authority should redirect and redesign its monetary policy tools towards determining the financial inclusion system in the country in order to capture citizens that are financial excluded.

T2  - Macroeconomic Dynamics
AB  - This study develops a monetary Schumpeterian model with endogenous market structure (EMS) to explore the effects of monetary policy on the number of firms, firm size, economic growth, and social welfare. EMS leads to different results from previous studies in which market structure is exogenous. In the short run, a higher nominal interest rate reduces the growth rates of innovation, output, and consumption and decreases firm size through reduction in labor supply. In the long run, a higher nominal interest rate reduces the equilibrium number of firms but has no steady-state effect on economic growth and firm size because of EMS. Although monetary policy has no long-run growth effect, increasing the nominal interest rate permanently reduces the levels of output, consumption, and employment. Taking transition dynamics into account, we find that welfare is decreasing in the nominal interest rate and the Friedman rule is optimal in this economy.

AB  - This paper examines the role of the reﬁnancing channel and the mortgage market structure for the transmission of monetary policy to consumption. First, I document heterogeneous consumption responses to monetary policy shocks. I ﬁnd a large consumption response for homeowners who reﬁnance or enter new loans, which is concentrated among younger people. Second, I develop a life-cycle model with ﬁxed rate mortgages that explains these facts. Moving from a ﬁxed to a variable rate mortgage structure reduces the heterogeneous eﬀects of monetary policy on consumption by age. At the same time, the aggregate eﬀects of monetary policy on consumption are increased substantially.

AB  - The dynamic relationship linking the volatility of equity prices with “the news” and the expected path for monetary policy is investigated. Previous results that link the impact of the news about real activity to changes in current and future interest rates are employed in developing a positive link between changes in volatility and the news. Empirically, our results uncover a positive and statistically significant response of the CBOE volatility index, VIX, to unanticipated changes in employment, but not to inflation. Hence, agents' expectations for the policy response to news have an important influence on the expected volatility of stock prices. (JEL E44, E52)

TI  - Asymmetric Effect of Monetary Policy on Stock Market Volatility in ASEAN5
AU  - Bui, Trung
T2  - Eurasian Journal of Business and Economics
AB  - Among many channels, stock market directly transmits the effect of monetary policy decisions because it quickly responds to policy news. The primary objective of this paper is to clarify the asymmetric effect of monetary policy on stock market volatility, which is believed to have adverse effects on the economy recovery, over its bull and bear period. We performed empirical research in a panel setting in which monthly data of ASEAN5 (Vietnam, Thailand, Philippines, Malaysia, and Indonesia) was collected from January 2006 to June 2013. To reduce identification and endogeneity problem, we used short-term interest rate as a proxy for the stance of monetary policy. The Markov switching model was used to identify the bull and bear periods of stock market. We employed feasible GLS estimator to examine the possible asymmetry. The empirical results have demonstrated the existence of the asymmetry in the monetary policy effect on the stock market volatility over stock market cycle in ASEAN5. The findings have suggested that monetary policy is more effective in bear market and that a tight monetary policy increases the probability of shifting stock market from bullish to bearish state.

AB  - This paper examines the implications of “keeping up with the Joneses” preferences (jealousy) for the welfare effects of monetary policy. I develop a New Keynesian model, where households are jealous and the central bank follows the Taylor rule. I show that the welfare effects of monetary policy over time depend significantly on the relative strength of the consumption externality caused by jealousy and the monopolistic distortion. When a first-order approximation of the utility function is used, then the main result is the following: If jealousy (the monopolistic distortion) dominates, then a decrease in the interest rate reduces (increases) welfare in the short run, but increases (reduces) welfare in the medium run. However, the use of a second-order approximation changes the sign of the overall welfare effect of monetary policy if the initial level of employment is at the optimal level or just below it.

AB  - In the wake of a severe recession and a sluggish recovery, labor market slack cannot be gauged solely in terms of the conventional measure of the unemployment rate (that is, the number of individuals who are not working at all and actively searching for a job). Rather, assessments of the employment gap should reflect the incidence of underemployment (that is, people working part time who want a full-time job) and the extent of hidden unemployment (that is, people who are not actively searching but who would rejoin the workforce if the job market were stronger). In this paper, we examine the evolution of U.S. labor market slack and show that underemployment and hidden unemployment currently account for the bulk of the U.S. employment gap. Next, using state-level data, we find strong statistical evidence that each of these forms of labor market slack exerts significant downward pressure on nominal wages. Finally, we consider the monetary policy implications of the employment gap in light of prescriptions from Taylor-style benchmark rules.

TI  - Has Monetary Policy Accelerated Job Polarization?
AU  - White, Neil
AB  - Since the late 1960s, the share of U.S. employment in occupations involving primarily routine tasks has declined by about 30 percent, a trend that has largely affected workers with a high-school degree but no college. This paper argues that contractionary monetary policy has accelerated this change. In part by disproportionately affecting industries with high shares of routine occupations, contractionary monetary policy shocks lead to large and very persistent shifts away from routine employment. Expansionary shocks, on the other hand, have little effect on these industries. Indeed, monetary policy’s effect on overall employment is concentrated in routine jobs. These results highlight monetary policy’s role in generating fluctuations not only in the level of employment, but also the composition of employment across occupations and industries.

TI  - CAPITAL MARKET RESPONSE TO MONETARY POLICY SHOCKS: EVIDENCE FROM NIGERIA - ProQuest
AB  - This study appraises the capital market response to monetary policy surprises in Nigeria.
Due to the critical role of the capital market in the international economy and finance, it becomes
very imperative to determine the effect of monetary policy announcements on its operations. This
study uses data that cover a period from 2000 to 2018 to analyze the effect of the monetary policy
shocks on the capital market outputs in Nigeria. The data are collected on capital market
capitalization, money supply, interest rate and exchange rate while applying the ordinary least
squares (OLS) multiple regression technique for data analysis. The multiple regression result
provides evidence that money supply has a remarkable positive impact on capital market
capitalization while the interest rate exerts a significant negative effect on the capital market
output. The study further reveals that the exchange rate has an insignificant positive effect on the
capital market performance. Based on these findings, the study suggests initial test running of all
monetary policy modifications by the monetary authority in the country before the full adoption of
such policy changes. The study also recommends that the CBN should endeavor to encourage
credit accessibility and investment in securities by reducing the interest rate and exchange rate
fluctuations.

AU  - Selim, Mohammad
T2  - International Journal of Islamic and Middle Eastern Finance and Management
AB  - Purpose This paper aims to investigate the macroeconomic effects of Qard-al-Hasan (QH) as a tool of monetary policy (MP) and its effectiveness in achieving full employment and price stability in the economy. Design/methodology/approach QH-based MP and its effects on major macroeconomic variables are examined on theoretical ground by using the standard aggregate output and aggregate expenditure model within the framework of Islamic economic principles. Findings QH-based MP positively influences real sectors of the economy and increases output, and the economy returns to full employment. QH provides the lowest possible borrowing costs across the economy and thus triggers rightward shift in aggregate supply curve and thus increases output and lowers price level. In addition, increase in output eliminates excess demand or shortages and thus maintains price stability. Furthermore, QH-based MP also increases exportable surplus and exports, decreases imports as well as increases inflow of funds and foreign currency reserves with the Central Bank and thus makes MP more effective. Research limitations/implications QH-based MP is usually expansionary MP, and as such, it can be argued that there is a probability that QH-based MP may lead to higher inflation rate. However, in this study, it has been shown with real world data in Table II, that 23 countries in Group 1 have pursued zero or negative interest rate policy and their experiences mitigate such probability. Originality/value This is, perhaps, the first paper that presents a complete model of QH as a tool of MP with fully explained transmission mechanism. This is new contribution in the literature of Islamic finance where theoretical model on QH is systematically developed and applied as an effective tool of MP in attaining full employment and price stability. This model of QH-based MP can unfold a new horizon of uninterrupted economic growth, full employment and price stability by increasing output and employment, as well as by eliminating excess demand or shortages.

AB  - The distributive consequences of monetary policy have been researched only recently and almost entirely in advanced economies. This paper sheds light on the effect of conventional monetary policy shocks on the wage distribution in South Africa, where inequality – mostly driven by the segmented labour market – remains a large issue. Impulse response functions estimated from local projections show that the wage distribution significantly worsens in response to monetary shocks. Wages in the top half of the distribution, that benefit from unanticipated expansions, are less responsive to surprise contractions, remaining protected by skill-biased technology and strong labour unions.

AU  - Fuentes, Carlos Javier Rodriguez
AB  - With the final phase of the European Monetary Union underway, concern has been raised over the regional implications of the European Central Bank (ECB) Monetary Policy. Departing from the standard approach utilized by the ECB, this book provides a comprehensive theoretical framework to explore the ways through which money and monetary policy may affect regions.              Carlos Rodriguez Fuentes, the rising star of Spanish economics, has produced a work of impressive clarity which analyzes the effects of regional monetary policy - with particular reference to European Monetary Union. Here, he examines the role that the banking system and the liquidity preference of economic agents play in the transmission of central banks monetary policy decisions to regions within a country or countries within a currency union. Rodriguez Fuentes utilizes a unique framework built upon the basic principle of the Post-Keynsian monetary theory which enables the identification of a new way for money and monetary policy to have a regional impact; the behavioural effect.         This book, with it’s combination of literary and empirical approach will prove essential reading for all students of economics and politics, as well as readers who interested in the development of the European Union.

AB  - The operational procedures of the Bank of Greece underwent major changes during the 1990s. These shifts in operational strategy made interest rates the main tool of monetary policy for the first time in Greece. This paper examines the effects of changes in the bank's operational interest rates on market interest rates at eight maturities and for different operational regimes. A major feature of our study is the application of the event study methodology used in finance, which has not been employed in any previous study on this subject. We find that changes in official interest rates had a significant influence on short-term and intermediate-term rates and that this relationship was affected by the changes in the bank's operational procedure.

TI  - The Effects of Monetary Policy on Mortgage Rates
AU  - Patrabansh, Saty
AU  - Doerner, William M.
AU  - Asin, Samuel
AB  - Economic events over the past decade have changed central bank policies in the United States and around the world. The housing and financial markets experienced significant changes as the markets first surpassed historical highs and then underwent a recession grave enough to draw comparison with the Great Depression. To spur recovery, the Federal Reserve first lowered short-term interest rates to near-zero and eventually embarked on several phases of large-scale asset purchases (LSAPs) to lower long-term interest rates and mortgage rates. This paper describes the evolution of the LSAP program and analyzes how interest rates and mortgage rates changed during that time. Both the long-term interest rates and mortgage rates reached historical lows in the post crisis period, primarily due to the Federal Reserve Board's accommodative policies. Two econometric approaches — an event study and a time series model — estimate the market response during each phase of the LSAP program and provide projections of mortgage rates under different shock assumptions. Results suggest that early tapering announcements helped reset interest rates and mortgage rates upwards and any rise in long-term interest rates resulting from unanticipated events (whether related to tapering or not) could lead to further increases in mortgage rates.

AB  - We investigate the role of housing and mortgage debt in the transmission and effectiveness of monetary policy. First, monetary policy induced-movements in house prices translate into consumption changes because of wealth eﬀects. Second, a contractionary monetary shock raises the cost of borrowing which reduces the demand and as a result the liquidity of the housing market, further depressing house prices and further increases the cost of borrowing. Furthermore, nominal long-term mortgage debt implies that changes in monetary policy result in redistribution between lenders and borrowers and generate cash-ﬂow eﬀects that are larger for borrowing constrained households. We build a heterogenous agent New Keynesian model with a frictional housing market to quantify the various mechanisms. The model is able to match the rich empirical heterogeneity in home ownership, leverage and MPC across households. In particular, our model is consistent with the signiﬁcant difference in MPC between low- and high-LTV households that we document in the data. Our quantitative ﬁndings are as follows: First, we ﬁnd that about 20% of the drop in aggregate consumption against a contractionary monetary shock is due to declining house prices. Second, we ﬁnd asymmetric responses of the economy to shocks, with contractionary shocks yielding a larger response of all variables. Finally, we investigate how the transmission of monetary policy depends on the distribution of mortgage debt and ﬁnd that monetary policy is more eﬀective in stimulating the economy in an high-LTV environment.

AB  - We show that production networks are important for the transmission of unconventional monetary policy. Firms with bonds eligible for purchase under the European Central Bank’s Corporate Sector Purchase Program act as financial intermediaries by extending additional trade credit to their customers. The increase in trade credit is pronounced from core countries to periphery countries and for financially constrained customers. Customers then increase investment and employment in response to the increased trade financing, whereas suppliers expand their customer base, contributing to upstream industry concentration. Our findings suggest that trade credit redistributes the effects of monetary policy across regions and firms.

AB  - We show that consumption expenditures for older households are more responsive to monetary policy shocks than for young- or middle-aged households. A one-standard-deviation expansionary monetary policy shock induces a statistically significant and quantitatively large (1.7%) increase in aggregate consumption for old households over the ensuing 3 years. The responses for young- and middle-aged households are smaller and not statistically significant. We also present evidence, suggesting that life-cycle wealth effects play a role in driving the responses. We then build the wealth mechanism into a partial equilibrium life-cycle model, which can qualitatively match the empirical patterns.

AB  - This paper offers an overview of the mandate of the European Central Bank (ECB), as defined by its objectives, the instruments available to achieve them and the constitutional framework that the ECB shall observe in pursuing them. The objectives include the primary objective of maintaining price stability and the secondary objective of supporting the general economic policies in the Union. The price stability objective enjoys primacy amongst the ECB objectives. The Treaties do not provide for a hierarchy of the “general economic policies” that the ECB shall support, although a number of criteria derived from primary law can help in guiding the ECB’s priorities in this respect. The ECB is also tasked with contributing to the “smooth conduct of policies pursued by the competent authorities relating to the prudential supervision of credit institutions and the stability of the financial system”. As for the instruments available, these include both measures that directly pursue the objectives and measures that are instrumental in achieving them. Finally, the other constitutional rules that set out the framework within which the ECB pursues its objectives include the principles of conferral, institutional balance, proportionality, equal treatment and non-discrimination, as well as the principle of an open market economy and the prohibition of monetary financing.

TI  - The Impact of Government-Driven Loans in the Monetary Transmission Mechanism: what can we learn from firm-level data?
AU  - Bonomo, Marco
AU  - Martins, Bruno
AB  - Government-driven credit had been expanding in Brazil since the financial crisis
of 2007/2008, reaching almost half of the total credit in 2012. While this large
participation may buffer the banking system from external shocks, it undoubtedly
affects the transmission of monetary policy. Using a huge repository of corporate
loan contracts, composing an unbalanced panel of almost 300,000 non-financial
firms between 2006 and 2012, this paper investigates its impact on the monetary
transmission mechanism. Our results show that the credit channel of monetary
policy is less effective for firms with government-driven loans access. This effect
is shown in the smaller variation both in the total amount of loans and in the
lending rate charged by private banks on free loan market. Merging loans
database with employment data from RAIS (Annual Social Information Report),
we also investigate the effects of monetary policy rate on employment. Our results
indicate that changes in policy rate have smaller effect on the level of employment
for firms with more access to earmarked and government-owned banks loans.
Additionally, we examine whether firms with larger fraction of governmentdriven loans are better able to insulate themselves from the effects of external
shocks, with resulting attenuated impact of those shocks on loans growth, interest
rate on private loans and employment growth. The evidence we found confirms
this hypothesis.

AB  - This paper compares actual U.S. monetary policy with an ideal policy based upon Wicksell's theory of natural and market rates of interest. For the period 1952–1971, this comparison indicates that actual policies behaved in a distinctly pro-cyclical manner with the result that monetary policies amplified the magnitude of the business cycles. The explanation offered suggests that this stems from the central bank's attempt to stabilize the interest rate which is consistent with one of the paper's findings of a highly significant positive relationship between changes in the natural rate of interest and changes in the monetary base.

T2  - Applied Financial Economics
AB  - This article investigates the channels through which the short-term interest rate is used as an instrument to stabilize the exchange rates in Asia during the financial crisis in the 1990s. A time-varying-parameter model with Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Heteroscedasticity (GARCH) disturbances is employed to estimate the dynamic effect of the interest rate on the exchange rate. We distinguish the direct effect from the indirect effect. The direct effect exists so that a contractionary monetary policy can have an appreciation impact (the traditional view). The indirect effect refers to the higher default risk induced by a monetary policy tightening, which on the contrary generates a depreciation pressure (the revisionist view). Using weekly data from Indonesia, South Korea and Thailand from 1997:07 to 1998:12, we find that there is no significant evidence in favour of the traditional view. The revisionist view is clearly in effect in Thailand at the very beginning of the crisis.

AB  - Sebastian Dullien gives a novel explanation for unemployment and inflation in the Euro-Zone. He argues that unemployment stems from a lack of co-operation between unions and monetary authorities: In an economy with endogenous money as EMU, wage setters are responsible for price stability while the central bank is responsible for the level of output. Co-operation between both actors is necessary for high employment and low inflation. The current institutional set-up is found to be unable to assure cooperation.

AB  - This study examines the effect of monetary policy on the performance of listed deposit money banks in Nigeria from 2006-2018. The research design adopted for this study was ex post-facto research design. Panel time series data were extracted based on the variables used in the study. Net profit margin (NPM) as the dependent variable, while liquidity ratio (LQR), Interest Rate (INR), Loan to deposit ratio (LDR) and cash reserve ratio (CRR) as independent proxies to measure monetary policy. The findings show that monetary policy has significant effect on the performance of listed deposit money banks in Nigeria. Based on the result, it was concluded that liquidity ratio and loan to deposit are significant on net profit margin, likewise interest rate and cash reserve ratio were insignificant on net profit margin. Therefore, the effect of monetary policy on the Nigeria commercial banks as an engine for controlling inflation, unemployment etc. is geared towards finding a positive and constructive role for the economy. Based on the findings, it was recommended that; the Central Bank of Nigeria should manage the monetary policy rate properly, with the recent increase of loan to deposit, Government should also employ other measures to control the loan to deposit and the monetary authorities should also minimize the 22.5% Cash reserve ratio in order to influence the level of bank performance with capacity to raise a volume of funds and also reduce the liquidity ratio from 30% to 25% to prevent the banks from folding up.

AB  - This paper investigates the impact of monetary policy on stock returns in thirteen OECD countries over the period 1972-2002. Our results indicate that monetary policy shifts significantly affect stock returns, thereby supporting the notion of monetary policy transmission via the stock market. Our contribution with respect to previous work is threefold. First, we show that our findings are robust to various alternative measures of stock returns. Second, our inferences are adjusted for the non-normality exhibited by the stock returns data. Finally, we take into account the increasing co-movement among international stock markets. The sensitivity analysis indicates that the results remain largely unchanged.
