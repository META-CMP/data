AB  - A Structural VAR model is employed to investigate the effects of monetary and fiscal policy shocks on stock market performance in Germany, UK and the US. A significant number of past studies have concentrated their attention on the relationship between monetary policy and stock market performance, yet only few on the effects of fiscal policy on stock markets. Even more we know little, if any, on the effects of fiscal and monetary policies on stock market performance when the two policies interact. This study aims to fill this void. Our results show that both fiscal and monetary policies influence the stock market, via either direct or indirect channels. More importantly, we find evidence that the interaction between the two policies is very important in explaining stock market developments. Thus, investors and analysts in their effort to understand the relationship between macroeconomic policies and stock market performance should consider fiscal and monetary policies in tandem rather than in isolation.

TI  - Monetary policy effects on investment spending: a firm‐level study of Malaysia
AU  - Abdul Karim, Zulkefly
T2  - Studies in Economics and Finance
AB  - Purpose – The purpose of this paper is to explore the role of monetary policy transmission mechanism channel on firms' investment spending. The focal point is to investigate the differential of monetary policy effects across sub‐sector firms' investment by examining the role of interest rates, and broad credit channel of monetary transmission. Design/methodology/approach – The following research design has been employed in examining the relevance of both monetary policy channels. First, the firm user cost of capital as a proxy for the interest rates channel is constructed. Second, the neoclassical model of firm‐level investment function has been estimated using the dynamic panel data technique. Findings – The results revealed that the monetary policy transmission mechanism works through both interest rate, and broad credit channels in influencing firms' investment spending in the Malaysian economy. Monetary policy has heterogeneous effects in respect of sub‐sectors of the economy. In the long‐run, the firm investment in the consumer products and services sectors are significantly affected by the interest rate and broad credit channels. However, the firm investment in the industrial products and property sectors has only been significantly affected by interest rates and broad credit channel, respectively. Originality/value – The empirical results provide new evidence on the microeconomic effects of monetary policy in a small open economy (i.e. Malaysia) in two dimensions. First, this finding has supported the relevance of interest rates and broad credit channel of monetary transmission in a small open economy. Second, monetary policy effects are also heterogeneous by sub‐sectors of the economy, as some sectors (for example, consumer products, industrial products, and services) are significantly affected by monetary policy, and other sub‐sectors (for example, property) are not affected.

AB  - Macroeconomic agent based models have been around for at least a decade, and they have been remarkably successful in replicating many empirical “stylized facts”. Only a handful of papers, however, has explored the effects of monetary policy. In this paper we present an agent-based macroeconomic model where the interplay between credit market conditions and firms’ balance sheets is key in the determination of endogenous fluctuations. We use the model as a simulation platform by which we perform several experiments of monetary policy. Simulations showed a clear nonneutrality of monetary policy, which finds its transmission mechanism in the credit channel. Besides, we also evaluated the performance of a monetary Authority whose reaction function was modelled according to a standard Taylor rule, which turns out to be quite successful as an effective macro-stabilization tool.

AB  - We evaluate the effects of permanently reducing labour tax rates in the euro area (EA) by simulating a large-scale open economy dynamic general equilibrium model. The model features the EA as a monetary union, split in two regions (Home and the rest of the EA - REA), the US, and the rest of the world, region-specific labour markets with search and matching frictions, and public employment. Our results are as follows. First, a permanent reduction in labour tax rates in the Home region would have stimulating effects on domestic economic activity and employment. Second, reducing labour tax rates simultaneously in both Home and REA would have additional expansionary effects on the Home region. Third, in the short run the expansionary effects on the EA economy of a EA-wide tax reduction are enhanced if the EA monetary policy is accommodative.

TI  - Fiscal and Monetary Policy Instruments and Economic Growth Sustainability in Nigeria
AU  - Falade, Olanipekun
AU  - Folorunso, Benjamin
AB  - The paper examined the relative effectiveness of fiscal and monetary policy instruments on economic growth sustainability in Nigeria in order to determine the appropriate mix of both policies. The paper employed error correction mechanism whereby the time series properties of fiscal and monetary variables were first examined using Augmented Dickey-Fuller and Philip Perron unit root tests, followed by Johansen cointegration test among the series using annual data for the period 1970-2013. Data were sourced mainly from Statistical Bulletin published by the Central Bank Nigeria. The unit root test results revealed that all fiscal and monetary policy variables are non-stationary and attained stationarity at first difference. The result also showed that all the fiscal and monetary variables of interest cointegrated with the economic growth series in the country. This suggests that there is a long run relationship among fiscal and monetary variables and economic growth. The paper, however, found that the current level of exchange rate and its immediate past level, domestic interest rate, current level of government revenue and current level of money supply are the appropriate policy instrument mix in promoting economic growth both in the short and long run. The paper concluded that fiscal and monetary are still complementary.

AB  - What transmission channels drive the effect of monetary policy on consumption inequality? This paper investigates this question with tractable Two-Agent New Keynesian models with search-and-matching frictions and wage rigidities. I make a distinction between credit-constrained households and unconstrained households and find that an expansionary monetary policy shock decreases consumption inequality between those two households through three channels: (i) the income composition channel, through fluctuations in labor and profit income; (ii) the savings redistribution channel, through fluctuations in real interest rate; and (iii) the earnings heterogeneity channel, through fluctuations in unemployment. The results are in line with the empirical evidence.

AB  - In many countries, the focus of monetary policy is increasingly shifting to low and stable inflation as it provides many benefits to the economy. However, there is evidence that costs of inflation reduction are inequitably distributed by gender in developing countries. This paper addresses employment costs of inflation reduction in developed countries. Using quarterly data for 1980-2006, we examine gender and country differences in the effects of interest rate on employment in nine OECD countries. We look at total employment, as well as employment dis-aggregated by three sectors: agriculture, industry and services. We find that the link between monetary policy instruments (short-term interest rates) and employment in the industrial countries under investigation is neither strong nor varies by gender.

AB  - I develop a version of the New Keynesian model with insider–outsider labor markets and hysteresis that can account for the high persistence of European unemployment. I study the implications of that environment for the design of monetary policy. The optimal policy calls for strong emphasis on (un)employment stabilization which a standard interest rate rule fails to deliver, with the gap between the two increasing in the degree of hysteresis. Two simple targeting rules are shown to approximate well the optimal policy. The properties of the model and effects of different policies are analyzed through the lens of the labor wedge and its components.

TI  - Financing Super-Infrastructures Using ISTISNA-SUKUK Based Monetary POLICY for Faster Economic Development - ProQuest
AB  - Most efficient and super-infrastructures are preconditions for faster economic
growth for any country. Most countries often finance such project by incurring
public debt and such countries must pay interest every year on public debt until
the entire accumulated amount is fully paid. However, interest-based financing
is not only prohibited (haram) but it also drains billions of dollars to foreign
creditors every year from most of the countries that have accumulated interestbased debts over the years. This paper attempts to explore how building a most
modern Airport can be financed by pursuing Istisna-Sukuk based expansionary
monetary policy (MP). Central Bank (CB) can buy and sell such Sukuk in open
market as tools of monetary policy. Sukuk are interest-free modes of financing.
They are issued against assets, such as, the Airport, and their holders are the
true owners of the Airport who derive their income from this asset instead of
coupon or interest rates. Istisna-Sukuk based expansionary monetary policy
does not incurring public debt nor require payments of interest. In this paper,
it has been shown that Istisna-Sukuk financing will have expansionary
monetary policy effects and, as such, it will increase output and employment
and consequently will reduce unemployment rate. In addition, it will also
eliminate public debt and interest payments for the government, and the
government will have more funds available for public spending. As a result,
economic expansion and prosperity will continue to flourish. Eventually, it will
help prevent transfer of domestic resources as interest payments to foreign
creditors.

Using capital market data and an event study methodology it was found that bank stocks exhibited significant abnormal returns during the announcement week of the policy change. When these abnormal returns were decomposed into a part related to unexpected interest rate changes and a part (assumed) to reflect increased rate variability, the results were consistent with a negative relationship between bank returns and interest rate surprises as well as between bank returns and rate variability.

TI  - Firm Balance Sheet Liquidity, Monetary Policy Shocks, and Investment Dynamics
AU  - Jeenas, Priit
AB  - This paper evaluates the role of ﬁrms’ balance sheet liquidity in the transmission of monetary policy to investment. I estimate that in response to contractionary monetary policy shocks, both ﬁrms with higher leverage or with fewer liquid assets reduce investment relative to others. However, controlling for liquid assets, leverage loses its signiﬁcance in explaining such heterogeneity while liquid assets remain important conditional on leverage. To explain these results, I introduce ﬁxed issuance costs on long-term debt ﬁnancing in an otherwise conventional general equilibrium model of heterogeneous ﬁrms and borrowing constraints. In the calibrated model, balance sheet liquidity predicts investment sensitivity to corporate debt rates better than leverage. Fixed issuance costs give rise to relatively wealthy ﬁrms who are not borrowing constrained but exhibit large marginal propensities to invest out of liquid income. This can considerably amplify the aggregate eﬀects of shocks and policies which aﬀect ﬁrms’ cash ﬂows.

TI  - Monetary Policy and Home Buying Inequality
AU  - Ringo, Daniel
AB  - Monetary policy influences who becomes a home owner.  Home purchases by low- and moderate-income households are particularly sensitive to mortgage interest rates, as these households' budgets are tighter and they more frequently come up against binding payment-to-income ratio constraints in credit decisions.  Exploiting the timing of high-frequency observations of mortgage applicants locking in their interest rates around monetary policy shocks, I find that a 1 percentage point policy-induced increase in mortgage rates lowers the presence of low-income households in the population of home buyers by 1 percentage point, and of low- and moderate-income households by 2 percentage points, immediately following the shock.  Effects are substantially stronger among first-time home buyers, and persist for approximately one year.   The estimated effect of monetary tightening on the share of home purchase loans by underrepresented minorities is statistically insignificant.

AB  - We provide a framework in which monetary policy affects firms’ automation decisions (i.e. how intensively capital and labor are used in production). This new feature has far-reaching consequences for monetary policy. Monetary expansions can increase output by inducing firms to invest and automate more, while having little impact on inflation and employment. A protracted period of weak demand might translate into less investment and deautomation, rather than into deflation and involuntary unemployment. Running the economy hot, through expansionary monetary and fiscal policies, may have a positive long run impact on labor productivity and wages. Technological advances that increase the scope for automation may give rise to persistent unemployment, unless they are accompanied by expansionary macroeconomic policies.

T2  - Journal of Economics and Policy Analysis
AB  - Macroeconomists and policymakers worldwide have given critical attention to the introduction of new monetary policy mandates to envisage and address the economic shock perceived in most developed and developing nation. Part of the reason for this attention is to incorporate unemployment and poverty reduction in the core mandate of the monetary authority. While many scholars have contended that this approach to monetary policy is inappropriate, since the major obligation is to maintain financial stability and bank supervision among other objectives, others have welcomed the proposition as an option to use credit allocation, capital management and interest rate as yardstick for achieving this new role. This study examined the emergence of this new mandate, with specific focus on the Nigerian economy between 1971 and 2014, using the vector autoregressive approach to estimate the interaction and feedback mechanism to check the connection between monetary policy instrument and the new mandate of unemployment and poverty reduction. Based on the findings, it recommended the use of conventional and unconventional monetary policies as option s for reducing unemployment and poverty in Nigeria.

Large-scale macroeconometric models are employed for forecasting, policy simulations, and the evaluation of monetary policy rules. However, in this work, we employ a mix of the algorithmic application of these models and judgment guided by information not available to models. We describe this approach and present an assessment of its strengths and weaknesses. The experience of the 1990–1991 recession and the subsequent recovery is used to illustrate some of the practical difficulties surrounding the use of econometric models for policy analysis.

This survey of the literature on Monetary policy and growth shows that money plays a small role in developing countries and that monetary policy is not a very important influence on growth but may have some impact on inflation.Although there is much discussion about the merits of keeping inflation levels and volatility low, there is very little literature on studying the impact of low rates of steady inflation on the levels of private investment and technological change and hence on economic growth and on employment.There is very little research about the direct links between monetary policy and employment. The impact of growth on employment depends on what are the main drivers of economic growth and the initial state of the economy. Although growth may lead to increasing employment (formal and informal) there is little evidence showing that growth leads to an increase in "decent employment".

AB  - This paper evaluates the relevance of the "bank lending channel'' of monetary policy transmission in Brazil. Disaggregated monthly data of the Brazilian banks balance sheets from December 1994 to December 2001 are analyzed. In addition to the short-term interest rate, we consider the effects of another monetary policy instrument frequently used in Brazil, represented by reserve requirements on overall banks deposits - demand, savings, and time deposits. Dynamic panel data techniques are employed. Our results suggest that the impact of reserve requirements is relevant and stronger for larger banks loans. This finding results from the progressive reserve rates required from banks, which affect to a greater extent banks with larger deposit volumes.

AB  - This study seeks to evaluate the efficacy of macroeconomic revamping policies operationalized after the pandemic by fiscal and monetary regulators to fight the pandemic in China. This study aims to assess what the Chinese economic recovery implies after the pandemic regarding economic expansion and energy consumption of different economies utilizing an econometric approximation relying on data throughout the COVID-19 phase. Within the extended stage, Chinese economic development spillover impacts attain the same effect on upper-middle-income nations' economic expansion of 0.18 percent, next to the economic development, of lower-middle-income countries of 0.15 percent and high-income nations. We discover proofs of robust direct provincial spillovers, implying that provinces tend to construct a cluster of high-performing and low-performing areas, a procedure that accentuates regional earnings variances. Applying the experience of revamping previous financial crisis, we replicate the impact of the pandemic on the competence of these, and by far, other upper limit income nations to build back better from the pandemic to jobs occasioned by proofs of the pandemic. The spillover impact of China’s economic revival past the pandemic phase's carries a critical effect on the expansion in energy consumption in high-income nations, subsequently middle-income nations. As total factor productivity headwinds underpin economic growth, fiscal policy is the only policy that probably sustains the pollution intensities and concurrently advances household well-being regarding consumption and jobs.

AU  - Gornemann, Nils

AU  - Nakajima, Makoto
AB  - We build a New Keynesian business-cycle model with rich household heterogeneity. In the model, systematic monetary stabilization policy affects the distribution of income, income risks, and the demand for funds and supply of assets: the demand, because matching frictions render idiosyncratic labor-market risk endogenous; the supply, because markups, adjustment costs, and the tax system mean that the average profitability of firms is endogenous. Disagreement about systematic monetary stabilization policy is pronounced. The wealth rich or retired tend to favor inflation targeting. The wealth-poor working class, instead, favors unemployment-centric policy. One- and two-agent alternatives can show unanimous disapproval of inflation-centric policy, instead. We highlight how the political support for inflation-centric policy depends on wage setting, the tax system, and the portfolio that households have.

AU  - Adabor, Opoku

T2  - Economics Literature
AB  - Monetary policy, foreign direct investment, and the stock market continue to dominate in discussions in developing countries. However, the linkage between the three variables in empirical literature remains unclear. This study aims to test two separate hypotheses: Firstly, the study examines the effects of monetary policy on stock market performance in Ghana. Secondly, the study also empirically investigates the effect of foreign direct investment on stock market performance in Ghana. Autoregressive Distributed Lag (ARDL) model was employed as an estimation strategy to examine the short and long-run effects using annual time series data from 1990 to 2019. The study revealed that monetary policy rate and money supply exerts a statistically significant negative and a positive effect on stock market performance in both the long and short-run in Ghana, respectively. It was also found that foreign direct investment has significant and a positive effect on stock market performance in Ghana in both the long and short run. Total capital stock and volume traded were also found to exert significant positive and negative impacts on stock market performance both in the short and long run respectively. Based on our findings, we recommend that expansionary monetary policy will be a better option to be carried out to improve the stock market performance in Ghana. Furthermore, government and private partnership may ensure the effective management of the macroeconomic variables to attract foreign direct investment into Ghana to boost stock market performance.

T2  - Journal of Financial Risk Management
AB  - For a better insight and understanding of how monetary policy and the financial market in less developed countries such as those in Africa are interrelated; there is a need to also understand and appreciate the fundamentals of these economies and the associating imperfections within their financial systems due to the fact that they are less liberalized, relatively young, highly illiquid, logistically constrained among others. This study is a comprehensive analysis of the dynamics in stock market performance following changes in monetary aggregates in ten (10) selected African countries from 1993 to 2019. We adopted three stock market performance indicators; namely S & P global equity index, stock turnover and stock market capitalization as dependent variables and inflation, broad money growth, exchange rate, real interest rate and commercial bank and lender serving as independent variables. We then employed the random effect model based on our results from the Hausman test and VECM after co-integration was established among the variables. The study established the presence of a monetary transmission mechanism following changes in money supply. We found that growth in broad money positively affects the stock market performance through the interest rate channel. Interest rate and inflation recorded negative effects on stock market performance indices. We also found that changes in monetary policy are highly significant in stock market performance in the West African market due to the relatively high level financial openness in the countries under consideration.

AB  - Abstract The aim of the paper is to evaluate the effects of loose monetary policy on corporate investment of manufacturing firms in the Czech Republic during the period between 2006 and 2015. The main focus of the paper is on the effect of low interest rates on investment activity of Czech firms; additionally, the effects of interactions between interest rate and other firm-specific variables are investigated. The results indicate that corporate investment is positively associated with firm size, investment opportunities, and long term debt. Also, a negative effect of the cash position is found. Further, the findings show that monetary policy is a significant determinant of firm investment activity: when the monetary policy is loose, investment is positively affected. Furthermore, differences in the determinants of investment between highly and low leveraged firms were revealed.

AB  - Understanding the political economy of monetary policy has progressed in recent years because of advances in three areas: the application of rational expectations perspectives to monetary policy, the extension of the economic theory of bureaucracy and public choice insights to monetary policy institutions, and statistical research regarding political influences on monetary policy and related inflation performance. This paper first discusses how Keynesian, game theoretic and partisan modeling of monetary policy have actually inhibited a realistic political economy understanding. It then reviews developments in each of the three areas of progress. It also shows how these recent advances provide insights into the costs of monetary policy as well as into the economics of optimal monetary reform — specifically, the optimal restructuring of central banks.

We review the history of monetary policy modeling, survey the core monetary models used by major central banks, and construct an illustrative model for those readers who are unfamiliar with the literature. Within this framework, we highlight several important limitations of current models and methods, including the fact that local-linearization approximations omit important nonlinear dynamics, yielding biased impulse-response analysis and parameter estimates. We also propose new features for the next generation of macrofinancial policy models, including a substantial role for the financial sector, the government balance sheet, and unconventional monetary policies; heterogeneity, reallocation, and redistribution effects;the macroeconomic impact of large nonlinear risk premium dynamics; time-varying uncertainty; financial sector and systemic risks; imperfect product market and markups; and further advances in solution, estimation, and evaluation methods for dynamic quantitative structural models.

TI  - Does Monetary Policy matter for Agricultural Sector Performance? Empirical Evidence from Nigeria
T2  - Journal of Economics and Sustainable Development
AB  - The paper examined the impact of monetary policy on agricultural sector performance in Nigeria, using annual data spanning the period 1981 to 2016. Given its significant role in providing employment to about 60 % of the economically active population and 70% of the country’s poorest communities, agriculture has huge potential for achieving poverty reduction in Nigeria. In this regard, the study employed the Autoregressive-Distributed Lag (ARDL) approach and established a long- run relationship between agriculture value added and some monetary policy variables. Specifically, the findings suggested that in the long-run, money supply and maximum lending rate have significant effects on agriculture value added while exchange rate and inflation do not. Given the important role of money supply in promoting agricultural sector performance, the paper recommends an expansionary but non-inflationary monetary policy to improve value addition to the agricultural sector of the Nigerian economy.

AB  - Share buybacks have become common practice across U.S corporations. This paper shows that firms finance these operations mostly through newly issued corporate bonds, and that the exogenous variation in the cost of debt – due to innovations in monetary policy – is key in explaining managers’ incentives to repurchase their own shares. Under our identification strategy, we find that firms are more likely to repurchase in periods of accommodating monetary policy when the yield on bond adjusts in the same direction. This behavior has macroeconomic implications as it exacerbates the crowding-out effect on investment and employment, thus reducing the transmission of monetary policy at establishment level.

TI  - Alternatives to Inflation Targeting Monetary Policy for Stable and Egalitarian Growth: A Brief Research Summary
AU  - Epstein, Gerald
AB  - Many countries in the developing world have adopted an approach to monetary policy that focuses on maintaining a low level of inflation, to the exclusion of other important objectives such as employment generation, increasing investment or reducing poverty, despite the widespread evidence that moderate levels of inflation have few or no costs. Some have even adopted formal "inflation targeting", an approach which commits the central bank to hitting a fairly rigid inflation target, often as low as 2%. However, this focus has led to slower economic growth and lower employment growth, without succeeding in lowering inflation at a smaller economic cost than traditional methods of inflation fighting. Clearly, it is time to find an alternative to inflation targeting. This paper presents the real targeting approach to monetary policy, which I argue is superior alternative to the costly and ineffective inflation targeting approach. Under this real targeting approach, central banks are given a country appropriate target such as employment growth, unemployment, real GDP or investment, usually subject to an inflation constraint. Given these two targets - the real target and the constraint - the central bank will find multiple tools to reach these targets, designing new tools and rediscovering old tools such as asset based reserve requirements and other credit allocation techniques. The real targeting approach might also be complemented by other policies, such as capital management techniques to deal with possible capital flight. The real targeting approach has the potential to make central bank policy more transparent, more accountable, and more socially useful than most currently existing central bank structures.

AB  - The digitalisation workstream report analyses the degree of digital adoption across the euro area and EU countries and the implications of digitalisation for measurement, productivity, labour markets and inflation, as well as more recent developments during the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic and their implications. Analysis of these key issues and variables is aimed at improving our understanding of the implications of digitalisation for monetary policy and its transmission. The degree of digital adoption differs across the euro area/EU, implying heterogeneous impacts, with most EU economies currently lagging behind the United States and Japan. Rising digitalisation has rendered price measurement more challenging, owing to, among other things, faster changes in products and product quality, but also new ways of price setting, e.g. dynamic or customised pricing, and services that were previously payable but are now “free”. Despite the spread of digital technologies, aggregate productivity growth has decreased in most advanced economies since the 1970s. However, it is likely that without the spread of digital technologies the productivity slowdown would have been even more pronounced, and the recent acceleration in digitalisation is likely to boost future productivity gains from digitalisation. Digitalisation has spurred greater automation, with temporary labour market disruptions, albeit unevenly across sectors. The long-run employment effects of digitalisation can be benign, but its effects on wages and labour share depend on the structure of the economy and its labour market institutions. The pandemic has accelerated the use of teleworking: roughly every third job in the euro area/EU is teleworkable, although there are differences across countries. ...

AU  - Raczyński, Mikołaj
AB  - Recently, economic inequalities in many countries have markedly increased. We reviewed more than 40 recent research papers related to the impact of monetary policy on economic inequalities and analysed income and wealth inequalities along with conventional and unconventional monetary policies. The results of the literature review indicate that: (1) the employment response to a policy shift serves as the crucial aspect in determining distributional effects, (2) housing wealth acts as a mitigating factor when accounted for as net wealth, (3) the stock market exposure of households significantly affects the impact of monetary policy on inequality, (4) the impact on inequality of corporate bonds or equities purchases remains unexplored, (5) most of the studies based on survey data indicate lower inequality from policy easing, whereas most of the studies based on tax data or national accounts point in the opposite direction, and (6) estimated changes in inequality measures appear relatively modest.

TI  - Inequality and Optimal Monetary Policy
AU  - Ko, Dong-Whan
AB  - In this paper, I investigate the eﬀect of income inequality on optimal monetary policy design. To this end, I introduce heterogeneity by incorporating segmented labor markets with a Limited Asset Market Participation (LAMP) into the standard New Keynesian DSGE model used in Erceg et al. (2000). Because of the diﬀerence in real rigidity across sectors, an economic shock, especially a monetary policy shock, causes a variation in the wage premium. This variation in wage premium encourages ﬁrms to substitute workers across sectors, which induces stickier aggregate nominal wage and more volatile macroeconomic variables. At the same time, however, a change in wage premium leads to a greater change in the employment gap across sectors (given a plausible value of elasticity of substitution), and thus income inequality is negatively related to the wage premium. In addition, income inequality poses a trade-oﬀ with traditional policy objectives such as the output gap even under ﬂexible wages. Therefore, it is desirable to include inequality as a separate goal for a Central Bank. Welfare analysis of various scenarios shows that when a Central Bank ignores inequality, focusing only on aggregate variables, there are signiﬁcant welfare losses.

AB  - We use household surveys to describe differences in wages, income, wealth and liquid assets of households born in their country of residence (“natives”) vs. those born in other EU and non-EU countries (“immigrants”). The differences in wealth are more substantial than the differences in wages and incomes: immigrants earn on average about 30% lower wages than natives and hold roughly 60% less net wealth. For all variables, only a small fraction of differences between natives and immigrants—around 30%—can be explained by differences in demographics (age, gender, marital status, education, occupation, sector of employment). Immigrants are more likely to be liquidity constrained: while about 17% of natives can be labelled as “hand-to-mouth” (holding liquid assets worth less than two weeks of income), the corresponding share is 20% for households born in another EU country and 29% for those born outside the EU. Employment rates of immigrants are substantially more sensitive to fluctuations in aggregate employment. Monetary policy easing stimulates more strongly employment of individuals born outside the EU.

TI  - Monetary policy shocks and financial conditions: A Monte Carlo experiment
AU  - Castelnuovo, Efrem
T2  - Journal of International Money and Finance
AB  - The effects of monetary policy shocks on financial conditions are often estimated by appealing to recursive Vector AutoRegressions (VARs). We assess the ability of this class of VARs to recover the true effects of a monetary policy shock via a Monte Carlo experiment in which the Data Generating Process is a Dynamic Stochastic General Equilibrium (DSGE) model featuring macro-finance interactions and estimated with U.S. quarterly data. Our DSGE model predicts a negative and significant reaction of financial conditions to an unexpected monetary policy tightening. We point out that such reaction is just overlooked by recursive VARs. Moreover, we show that Cholesky-VARs may substantially underestimate the welfare costs due to macroeconomic fluctuations.

AB  - We develop a financial condition index (FCI) and examine the effects of monetary policy on financial conditions in Indonesia. We show that our FCI tracks financial conditions quite well because it captures key financial events (the Asian financial crisis of 1997–1998, the Indonesian banking crisis, and the global financial crisis and its aftermath). A unique feature of our FCI is that it is quarterly and thus offers near real-time development in financial conditions. We also show that monetary policy shapes the FCI. A contractionary monetary policy leads to unfavourable financial conditions during the first two quarters, followed by favourable financial conditions for nearly three quarters. This finding is robust to an alternative identification strategy. Our findings highlight the critical role of the monetary authority in shaping financial conditions in Indonesia.

AB  - This paper presents the main findings of an International Banking Research Network initiative examining the interaction between monetary policy and macroprudential policy in determining international bank lending. We give an overview on the data, empirical specifications and results of the seven papers from the initiative. The papers are from a range of core and smaller advanced economies, and emerging markets . The main findings are as follows. First, there is evidence that macroprudential policy in recipient countries can partly offset the spillover effects of monetary policy conducted in core countries. Meanwhile, domestic macroprudential policy in core countries can also affect the cross-border transmission of domestic monetary policy via lending abroad, by limiting the increase in lending by less strongly capitalized banks. Second, the findings highlight that studying heterogeneities across banks provides complementary insights to studies using more aggregate data and focusing on average effects. In particular, we find that individual bank characteristics such as bank size or GSIB status play a first-order role in the transmission of these policies. Finally, the impacts differ considerably across prudential policy instruments, which also suggests the importance of more granular analysis.

AB  - This report discusses the role of the European Union’s full employment objective in the conduct of the ECB’s monetary policy. It first reviews a range of indicators of full employment, highlights the heterogeneity of labour market outcomes within different groups in the population and across countries, and documents the flatness of the Phillips curve in the euro area. In this context, it is stressed that labour market structures and trend labour market outcomes are primarily determined by national economic policies. The report then recalls that, in many circumstances, inflation and employment move together and pursuing price stability is conducive to supporting employment. However, in response to economic shocks that give rise to a temporary trade-off between employment and inflation stabilisation, the ECB’s medium-term orientation in pursuing price stability is shown to provide flexibility to contribute to the achievement of the EU’s full employment objective. Regarding the conduct of monetary policy in a low interest rate environment, model-based simulations suggest that history-dependent policy approaches − which have been proposed to overcome lasting shortfalls of inflation due to the effective lower bound on nominal interest rates by a more persistent policy response to disinflationary shocks − can help to bring employment closer to full employment, even though their effectiveness depends on the strength of the postulated expectations channels. Finally, the importance of employment income and wealth inequality in the transmission of monetary policy strengthens the case for more persistent or forceful easing policies (in pursuit of price stability) when interest rates are constrained by their lower bound.

TI  - The effects of monetary policy shocks in Peru: Semi-structural identification using a factor-augmented vector autoregressive model
AU  - Lahura, Erick
AB  - The main goal of this paper is to analyze the effects of monetary policy shocks in Peru, taking into account two important issues that have been addressed separately in the VAR literature. The first one is the difficulty to identify the most appropriate indicator of monetary policy stance, which is usually assumed rather than determined from an estimated model. The second one is the fact that monetary policy decisions are based on the analysis of a wide range of economic and financial data, which is at odds with the small number of variables specified in most VAR models. To overcome the first issue, Bernanke and Mihov (1998) proposed a semi-structural VAR model from which the indicator of monetary policy stance can be derived rather than assumed. Meanwhile, the data problem has been resolved recently by Bernanke, Boivin and Eliasz (2005) using a Factor-Augmented Vector Autoregressive (FAVAR) model. In order to capture these two issues simultaneously, we propose an extension of the FAVAR model that incorporates a semi-structural identification approach a la Bernanke and Mihov, resulting in a VAR model that we denominate SS-FAVAR. Using data for Peru, the results show that the SS-FAVAR's impulse-response functions (IRFs) provide a more coherent picture of the effects of monetary policy shocks compared to the IRFs of alternative VAR models. Furthermore, it is found that innovations to nonborrowed reserves can be identified as monetary policy shocks for the period 1995-2003.

AB  - We estimate the impact of U.S. monetary policy on the cross-sectional distribution of state economic activity for a 35-year panel. Our results indicate that the effects of policy have a significant history dependence, in that relatively slow growth regions contract more following contractionarymonetary shocks. Moreover, policy is asymmetric, in that expansionary shocks have less of a beneficial impact upon relatively slow growth areas. As a result, we conclude that monetary policy on average widens the dispersion of growth rates among U.S. states, and those locations initially at the low end of the cross-sectional distribution benefit least from any given change inmonetary policy.

Money circulates because it is more liquid than other assets, not because it has any special function. The model is used to investigate how aggregate activity and asset prices fluctuate with shocks to productivity and liquidity and to examine what role government policy might have through open-market operations that change the mix of assets held by the private sector.

T2  - The Quarterly Journal of Economics
AB  - We present a new channel for the transmission of monetary policy, the deposits channel. We show that when the Fed funds rate rises, banks widen the spreads they charge on deposits, and deposits flow out of the banking system. We present a model where this is due to market power in deposit markets. Consistent with the market power mechanism, deposit spreads increase more and deposits flow out more in concentrated markets. This is true even when we control for lending opportunities by only comparing different branches of the same bank. Since deposits are the main source of liquid assets for households, the deposits channel can explain the observed strong relationship between the liquidity premium and the Fed funds rate. Since deposits are also a uniquely stable funding source for banks, the deposits channel impacts bank lending. When the Fed funds rate rises, banks that raise deposits in concentrated markets contract their lending by more than other banks. Our estimates imply that the deposits channel can account for the entire transmission of monetary policy through bank balance sheets.

AB  - This paper investigates the impact of monetary policy on firm-level investment in contexts of economic turmoil. Using a panel of US public firms for the period 2000–2019, we show that policy-rate-based transmission mechanisms are undermined when uncertainty spikes. Furthermore, we find evidence of the existence of asymmetries at the firm level. In line with real options theory's predictions, firms with higher levels of investment irreversibility, operational inflexibility, and market power, as well as firms with lower cash flows and who operate in low-innovation sectors tend to be less responsive to changes in monetary policy. The effectiveness of monetary policy thus depends on the ability of monetary authorities to reduce uncertainty via expectations-based monetary tools, whilst targeting those sectors more likely to be affected by monetary-policy shifts.

AB  - This study broadly seeks to analyze the effect of monetary policy on the performance of deposit money banks in Nigeria. This research was based on secondary source of data extracted out from Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) statistical bulletin and Index mundi. The Autoregressive Distributed Lag (ARDL) approach to cointegration was applied to achieve the objective. The empirical results revealed that both in the long run and short run, bank lending rate (BLR) has been found to have a significant positive impact on banks loans and advances (BLA), This means that (BLR) has significant positive impact on the performance of deposit money banks in Nigeria. While liquidity rate (LR) has significant impact in the long run but has no significant impact in the short run likewise interest rate (IR) has no significant impact in the long run but in the short run has significant and positive impact on the performance of deposit money banks. The study concluded that increasing the interest rate can equally lead to improve performance in the short-run as this can motivate customers to save more but this effect will neutralize in the long-run. The study recommends that the central bank of Nigeria should redefine its monetary policy instruments to make them more attractive to the banks. This will make banks to embrace them beyond mere.

Such policies also support employment, economic activity, incomes and inflation, which can benefit the poor and middle-class, which have incomes more dependent on employment and which tend to spend a large share of their income on debt service.Monetary policy should focus on its mandate, while fiscal and social policies should address widening inequalities by revising the national social redistribution systems for improved efficiency, intergenerational equity and fair burden sharing between the wealthy and poor.

The empirical results seem to indicate that the price rule is likely to be more effective in managing the macroeconomy than the quantity rule, favoring the government’s intention of liberalizing interest rates and making a more active use of the price instrument. Moreover, the economy would have experienced less fluctuations had interest rate responded more aggressively to inflation.

AB  - This paper is motivated by the recent discussion on the need of market supervisors, regulators, and policy makers, to take into account the behavioral elements of market participant attitudes and psychological and cognitive biases when taking policy decisions. We contribute to the discussion by studying, for the first time, the relationship between conventional and unconventional central bank monetary policy and herd behavior in equity markets, and argue that the transmission channel, through which monetary policy may affect herd behavior, is economic expectations and investor sentiment. We combine a range of research methodologies to measure monetary policy, herd behavior, and their possible relation, and our results indicate that conventional and unconventional Fed monetary policy explains a significant percentage of US equity market herd behavior variance, while ECB monetary policy explains a lower percentage of Eurozone herding variance. Impulse Response Functions indicate that Fed's conventional expansionary policy and non-standard policy reduces the levels of herding in the US equity market, while conventional ECB expansionary policy induces higher levels of herding in Spain and Italy. We also detect spill-over effects from Fed monetary policy to EU market herd behavior.

AB  - A macroeconomic model is developed in which the psychological concept of loss aversion is incorporated into workers’ preferences. The impact of monetary policy in the presence of loss aversion depends on the specification of the reference wage. The plausible specification that a worker’s reference wage is the real wage she was paid in the previous period is considered in detail. Specifying the reference wage in this way, we show that an unanticipated change in monetary policy has a permanent, real effect when short term labour contracts are written in nominal wages.

AU  - Prasad, A.
AU  - Ghosh, Saibal
AB  - The paper examines the association and corporate behavior for a sample of manufacturing firms in India for the post-reform period 1992-2003. The findings suggest that a contractionary monetary policy lowers overall debt including bank debt, although the lagged response is positive, and listed firms increase their short-term bank borrowings, after monetary tightening. The responses of corporates to a monetary contraction in the post-1997 period has been more pronounced. A disaggregated analysis of responses of firms according to size and leverage largely validates these findings. Two policy implications emerge from the analysis. First, the interest rate transmission channel has strengthened since 1998, and, second, corporates in India, especially listed ones, seem to exhibit relationship lending.

TI  - Money and Monetary Policy Transmission in the Euro Area: Evidence from Favar- and VAR Approaches
AU  - Blaes, Barno
AB  - This paper investigates the transmission of monetary policy in the euro area based on the factor augmented vector autoregressive approach of Bernanke, Boivin and Eliasz (2005) as well as on a standard VAR model. We focus on the reaction of monetary aggregates to a one-off monetary policy shock. We find that - as theory suggests - money growth is dampened by a restrictive monetary policy stance in the longer term. In the short-run, however, M3 growth may increase due to portfolio shifts caused by the rise in the short-term interest rate. This has consequences for the interpretation of money growth as an input for monetary policy decisions.

TI  - Variations Across Canadian Regions in the Sensitivity to U.S. Monetary Policy
AU  - Potts, Todd

T2  - Atlantic Economic Journal
AB  - This paper contributes to the research on regional economic responses to monetary policy shocks in two ways. First, rather than just model the Canadian economy at the national level, we examine the impact of monetary policy shocks across five separate Canadian regions. The second extension of the literature is our focus upon estimating the impact from both Canadian and U.S. monetary policy shocks upon regional Canadian economic activity. The findings are broadly consistent with results from previous research modeling the national Canadian economy, but noteworthy regional differences are observed. Eastern Canadian regions, defined as Ontario (ON), Quebec (QU), and Atlantic (AT), exhibit greater sensitivity to Canadian monetary policy shocks than do Western Canadian regions. We also find that U.S. monetary policy shocks have a discernable impact on Canadian regional economic activity, but the impact varies across regions. For the three Eastern Canadian regions ON, QU, and AT, there is a significant impact upon regional economic activity from a U.S. monetary policy shock, but not for the two Western Canadian regions Prairie (PR) and West (WE). Moreover, the impact on ON, QU, and AT from a fed funds shock is quite similar to the impact from a shock to the Canadian Bank Rate.

AB  - This paper examines the distributional implications of ECB monetary policy on income inequality on a panel of 10 Euro area countries between 2000 and 2015. In contrast with the literature, we investigate different transmission channels and introduce several specifications (different monetary policy instruments, different indicators of income inequality, different data sources, parsimonious and larger models, shocks on monetary policy per se, on long-term rates and on inflation rates) in a panel VAR setting to highlight the robustness of results. Results suggest that: (i) the distributional effects of ECB's monetary policy have been modest and (ii) mainly driven in times of conventional monetary policy measures, especially in countries with a high level of income inequality, while, overall, (iii) standard and non-standard monetary policies do not significantly differ in terms of impact and (iv) baseline results persist when redistributive public policies are introduced. We further document that our results are more likely to be channelled via income composition effects.

AB  - This paper employs block recursive structural VAR models with Markov switching for modeling monetary policy and private sector behavior of the Japanese economy. By estimating the endogenous structural breaks, we investigate the existence, number, and nature of breaks possibly implied by the monetary policy adopted between 1975 and 2002. Results indicate that the Japanese economic system is best described by a non-absorbing two-state model, with major break happened around 1996. We also confirm that the interest rate monetary policy was effective before 1996, while monetary base shocks are identified as monetary policy shocks only after 1996. J. Japanese Int.

TI  - Bringing Financial Stability into Monetary Policy
AU  - Leeper, Eric M.
AU  - Nason, James M.
AB  - This paper arms central bank policy makers with ways to think about interactions between financial stability and monetary policy. We frame the issue of whether to integrate financial stability into monetary policy operating rules by appealing to the observation that in actual economies financial markets are incomplete. Incomplete markets create financial market frictions that prevent economic agents from perfectly sharing risk; in the absence of frictions, financial (in)stability would be of no concern. Overcoming these frictions to improve risk sharing across economic agents is, in our view, the intent of policies geared toward ensuring financial stability. There are many definitions of financial stability. Although the definitions share the notion that financial stability becomes an issue for policy makers when a breakdown in risk-sharing arrangements in financial markets has a negative effect on real economic activity, we give several examples that show this notion is too general for thinking about the role that monetary policy might have in smoothing shocks to financial stability. Examples include statistical models that seek to separate “good” from “bad” changes in private-sector debt aggregates, new Keynesian policy prescriptions grounded in neo-Wicksellian natural rate rules, and a historical episode involving the 1920s Federal Reserve. These examples raise a cautionary flag for policy attempts to control both the growth and the composition of debt that financial markets produce. We conclude with some advice for revising central banks’ Monetary Policy Reports.

TI  - Do Labour Market Reforms Achieve a Double Dividend under EMU? Discretionary versus Rule-based Monetary Policy Revisited
AU  - Belke, Ansgar
AU  - Kamp, Martina
T2  - Journal of Economic Integration
AB  - High equilibrium unemployment and the inflation bias in some EU countries require fundamental reforms of labour-market institutions. Impacts of different monetary regimes inside and outside EMU on the incentives for labour-market reforms are examined in a Barro-Gordon framework from the perspective of a single country. Monetary policy (discretionary versus rule-based) and the degree of labour-market reforms are determined simultaneously. It can be shown that discretionary policy outside EMU leads to a higher degree of reforms than rule-based policy since in the former case reforms reduce both unemployment and the inflation bias. However, rule-based monetary policy inside EMU limits the benefits of reforms to a positive impact on employment. Nevertheless, total economy welfare under EMU is superior to the one under discretionary policy. Insofar as a superior instrument is available for the parallel reduction of the equilibrium inflation rate, namely a strict monetary policy rule, the higher degree of labour-market reforms under discretionary monetary policy outside EMU only signals a kind of an overshooting.

AB  - Advances in information technology and bank consolidation have altered the way banks operate by necessitating that banks control costs and provide services efficiently to remain competitive. Given the unique role bank operations play in the transmission of monetary policy, a key unresolved question is whether bank efficiency alters monetary policy outcomes. Using a stochastic frontier approach to measure cost-efficiency and panel data of U.S. bank balance sheets, we show that banks with greater cost-efficiency are more sensitive to monetary shocks.

TI  - Housing and the Monetary Transmission Mechanism
AU  - Mishkin, Frederic S.
AB  - The housing market is of central concern to monetary policy makers. To achieve the dual goals of price stability and maximum sustainable employment, monetary policy makers must understand the role that housing plays in the monetary transmission mechanism if they are to set policy instruments appropriately. In this paper, I examine what we know about the role of housing in the monetary transmission mechanism and then explore the implications of this knowledge for the conduct of monetary policy. I begin with a theoretical and empirical review of the main housing-related channels of the transmission mechanism. These channels include the ways interest rates directly influence the user cost of housing capital, expectations of future house-price movements, and housing supply; and indirectly influence the real economy through standard wealth effects from house prices, balance sheet, credit-channel effects on consumer spending, and balance sheet, credit-channel effects on housing demand. I then consider the interaction of financial stability with the monetary transmission mechanism, and discuss the ways in which the housing sector might be a source of financial instability, and whether such instability could affect the ability of a central bank to stabilize the overall macroeconomy. I conclude with a discussion of two key policy issues. First, how can monetary policy makers deal with the uncertainty with regard to housing-related monetary transmission mechanisms? And second, how can monetary policy best respond to fluctuations in asset prices, especially house prices, and to possible asset-price bubbles?

AB  - China's monetary policy disposes of two sets of monetary policy instruments: Instruments of the central bank, the People's Bank of China (PBC) and non-monetary policy instruments. Additionally, the PBC's instruments include (i) price-based indirect; and (ii) quantity-based direct instruments. The simultaneous usage of these instruments leads to various distortions that ultimately prevent the interest rate channel of monetary transmission from functioning. Moreover, the strong influences of quantity-based direct instruments and non-monetary policy instruments question the approach of indirect monetary policy in general.

TI  - Monetary Policy Shocks, Financial Structure, and Firm Activity: A Panel Approach
AU  - Jeenas, Priit
AB  - This paper assesses the differences in how nonfinancial firms respond to high frequency identified monetary policy shocks conditional on various measures of their financial conditions. In line with the effects of monetary policy shocks on real aggregate activity, the most significant disparities between firms arise slowly, over a horizon of approximately 4 to 12 quarters after a shock. Among the explanatory financial variables considered, both higher leverage and lower liquid asset holdings at the time of a contractionary monetary shock tend to predict relatively lower fixed capital, inventory and sales growth in the cross-section of firms. When simultaneously controlling for both the relevance of leverage and liquid assets, it is the latter that explains the disparities over the longer horizon. Low liquid asset holdings are also shown to be associated with stronger pass-through to borrowing costs.

AB  - We study the impact of the announcement of the European Central Bank's (ECB's) Outright Monetary Transactions Program on small firms’ access to finance using a matched firm-bank data set from eight Eurozone countries. We find that following the announcement, credit access improved relatively more for firms borrowing from banks with high balance sheet exposures to impaired sovereign debt, with such firms less likely to be refused a loan or to be price rationed. Loan terms also improved as manifested by lengthening of loan maturities. Unconventional monetary policy has a positive impact on firms’ investment and profitability, while its effect on firm innovation is weaker.

The inference is, the magnitude of the response of stock prices to economic announcements depends on expectations about the announcements and the monetary policy response.

TI  - A Note on the Long-Run Neutrality of Monetary Policy: New Empirics
AU  - Asongu, Simplice
AB  - Economic theory traditionally suggests that monetary policy can influence the business cycle, but not the long-run potential output. Despite well documented theoretical and empirical consensus on money neutrality in the literature, the role of money as an informational variable for monetary policy decision has remained opened to debate with empirical works providing mixed outcomes. This paper addresses two substantial challenges to this debate: the neglect of developing countries in the literature and the use of new financial dynamic fundamentals that broadly reflect monetary policy. The empirics are based on annual data from 34 African countries for the period 1980 to 2010. Using a battery of tests for integration and long-run equilibrium properties, results offer overall support for the traditional economic theory.

AB  - How do banks transmit long-term central bank liquidity injections to borrowers? We exploit unique variation in how the ECB’s 2011-12 Long-Term Refinancing Operations (LTROs) affected lending to firms discontinuously across credit ratings (within banks) to make four contributions. (i) We show the LTROs induced increased bank lending to firms in France, including to SMEs, an elusive policy objective. (ii) We uncover important heterogeneity: banks pass through LTRO liquidity very differently to multi- bank firms than they do to firms with only one bank. (iii) Differences in liquidity transmission map to archetypal lending types: single-bank firms receive relationship lending, and these firms invest and grow in response, while multi-bank firms receive transactions-style lending and do not increase their investment. (iv) While the majority of the effect flows to firms whose loans are policy-eligible, we identify a spillover (onto multi-bank firms only) that appears to be driven by bank competition for borrowers.

In the light of this critique, the model is reformulated, with its basic structure intact, but with alternate post-Keynesian specifications of the Phillips curve being considered. It is shown that such modifications, either allow a long run trade-off between the rate of inflation and the level of output, the rate of capacity utilisation and, therefore, unemployment, or, in our preferred specification, changes in output and capacity have no implications for inflation over a large range of capacity utilisation. In either case, macroeconomic policy is restored to its role in maintaining full employment.

AB  - We show that firm liability structure and associated cash flows matter for firm behavior and that financial market participants price stocks accordingly. Stock price reactions to monetary policy announcements depend on the type and maturity of debt issued by the firms and the forward guidance provided by the Fed, both at and away from the zero lower bound. Further, the marginal stock market participant knows the current liability structures of firms and does not rely on rules of thumb. The cash flow exposure at the time of monetary policy actions predicts future investment, assets, and net worth, clearly violating the Modigliani-Miller theorem.

AB  - This paper presents a new method to analyze the effect of shocks on time series using a quantile impulse response function (QIRF). While conventional impulse response analysis is restricted to evaluation using the conditional mean function, here, we propose an alternative impulse response analysis that traces the effect of economic shocks on the conditional quantile function. By changing the quantile index over the unit interval, it is possible to measure the effect of shocks on the entire conditional distribution of a variable of interest in our framework. Therefore we can observe the complete distributional consequences of policy interventions, especially at the upper and lower tails of the distribution as well as at the mean. Using the new approach, it becomes possible to evaluate two distinct features (called “distributional effects”): (i) a change in the dispersion of the conditional distribution of interest after a shock, and (ii) a change in the degree of skewness of the conditional distribution caused by a policy intervention. None of these features can be observed in the conventional impulse response analysis exclusively based on the conditional mean function. In addition to proposing the QIRF, our second contribution is to present a new way to jointly estimate a system of multiple quantile functions. Our proposed system quantile estimator is obtained by extending the result of Jun and Pinkse (2009) to the time series context. We illustrate the QIRF on a VAR model in a manner similar to Romer and Romer (2004) in order to assess the impact of a monetary policy shock on the US economy.

AB  - In a monetary union the central bank constitution must distribute the power over monetary policy between the members and the administrative center of the union. We compare alternative distributions and evaluate their performance. Dominance of regional interests always leads to inefficient monetary stabilization policies. Whether or not dominance of regional interests leads to a higher long-run rate of inflation depends on the union's political constitution.

AB  - In the wake of the 1997–98 financial crises, interest rates in Asia were raised immediately, and then reduced sharply. We describe an environment in which this is the optimal monetary policy. The optimality of the immediate rise in the interest rate is an example of the theory of the second best: although high interest rates introduce an inefficiency wedge into the labor market, they are nevertheless welfare improving because they mitigate distortions due to binding collateral constraints. Over time, as the collateral constraint is less binding, the familiar Friedman forces dominate, and interest rates are optimally set as low as possible.

TI  - The Interaction Between Conventional Monetary Policy and Financial Stability: Chile, Colombia, Japan, Portugal and the UK
AU  - Venter, Zoë
T2  - Comparative Economic Studies
AB  - The relationship between monetary policy and financial stability has gained importance in recent years as Central Bank policy rates neared the zero-lower bound. We use an SVAR model to study the impact of monetary policy shocks on three proxies for financial stability as well as a proxy for economic growth. Monetary policy is represented by policy rates for the emerging market economies and shadow rates for the advanced economies in our paper. Our main results show that monetary policy may be used to correct asset mispricing, to control fluctuations in the real business cycle and also to tame credit cycles in the majority of cases. Our results also show that for the majority of cases, in line with conventional wisdom, local currencies appreciate following a positive monetary policy shock. Monetary policy intervention may indeed be successful in contributing to or achieving financial stability. The results, however, show that monetary policy may not have the ability to maintain or re-establish financial stability in all cases. Alternative policy choices such as macroprudential policy tool frameworks which are aimed at targeting the financial system as a whole may be implemented as a means of fortifying the economy.

AB  - An accommodating monetary policy followed by a sudden increase of the short term interest rate often leads to a bubble burst and to an economic slowdown. Through the implementation of an Agent Based Model with a financial accelerator mechanism we are able to study the relationship between monetary policy and large-scale crisis events. A two-step computational approach is proposed which performs (i) a pattern search of “double dip” episodes and (ii) counter-factual simulations implementing unconventional monetary policy. The main results can be summarized as follow: a) sudden and sharp increases of the policy rate can generate recessions; b) after a crisis, returning too soon and too quickly to a normal monetary policy regime can generate a “double dip” recession, while c) keeping the short term interest rate anchored to the zero lower bound in the short run can successfully avoid a further slowdown.

AU  - Okheshimi, Ebulison Nelson
T2  - American International Journal of Economics and Finance Research
AB  - This study examined the effect of monetary policy on assets quality indicator of Nigeria commercial bank soundness from 2009 to 2018. Cross sectional data were sourced from annual reports of commercial banks and Central Bank of Nigeria Statistical Bulletin. Assets quality indicator of commercial banks soundness was used as proxies for the dependent variables while cash reserve ratios, open market operation rates, monetary policy rates, treasury bills rates and money supply were used as proxies for the independent variables. Panel data methodology was employed while the fixed effects model was used as estimation technique at 5% level of significance. Fixed effects, random effects and pooled estimates were tested while the Hausman test was used to determine the best fit. Panel unit roots and panel cointegration analysis were conducted on the study.&nbsp; Findings of the study proved that cash reserve ratio, open market operations rates, monetary policy rates and treasury bills rates have no significant relationship with assets quality indicators of commercial banks in Nigeria. However, Money supply has significant relationship with assets quality indicators of commercial bank soundness in Nigeria. From the findings we recommend that Central Bank of Nigeria should intensify the use money supply as a veritable effective monetary policy tool to achieve bank soundness in Nigeria.&nbsp; Furthermore, CBN should redefine these monetary policy instruments such as open market operation and adjust the monetary policy rate by reducing the cash reserve ratio which will increase liquidity to enable the commercial banks to discharge their lending and investment duties effectively to the public.&nbsp; The cash reserve ratio should be used to complement the open market operations in ensuring that excess liquidity or lack of it in the banking system is minimized. It was further recommended that CBN should look beyond monetary policy in her regulatory governance of commercial banks as most monetary policy tools currently deployed do not have significant relationship with commercial bank soundness indicators within the periods covered in this study.

AB  - We study optimal monetary policy and welfare properties of a dynamic stochastic general equilibrium (DSGE) model with a labor selection process, labor turnover costs, and Nash bargained wages. We show that our model implies inefficiencies that cannot be offset in a standard wage bargaining regime. We also show that the inefficiencies rise with the magnitude of firing costs. As a result, in the optimal Ramsey plan, the optimal inflation volatility deviates from zero and is an increasing function of firing costs.

AB  - This paper examines the effect of monetary policy surprises on energy prices at intraday, daily, and monthly frequencies. We measure monetary policy shocks using changes in interest rate futures prices that capture unexpected changes in the fed funds target rate. We find a significant response of energy prices to surprise changes in the fed funds target rate in an intraday window immediately following the monetary announcement. However, the accumulated responses of energy prices to monetary shocks over a period of several days after the announcement are statistically insignificant. We also use fed funds futures data to identify the contemporaneous impact of monetary policy shocks on oil prices in a monthly structural vector autoregressive (VAR) setup. We find no statistically significant effect of federal funds rate shocks on oil prices. The VAR estimates support the assumption of no contemporaneous feedback from monetary policy to energy prices. © 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Jrl Fut Mark 35:87–103, 2015

AB  - This article reviews recent evidence on the interaction between monetary policy and household inequality. While economic inequality has been trending upwards in most advanced economies since the early 1980s, this analysis concludes that monetary policy has not been a major driver of those long-term trends. On the contrary, the accommodative monetary policies of recent years have had an equalising effect, particularly through employment gains for lower income households. Moreover, there is now more evidence showing that the distribution of income and wealth plays a key role in the transmission of monetary policy to household spending. However, while improvements to models and data have contributed to a better understanding of the ways in which household heterogeneity shapes the transmission of monetary policy, several unsolved puzzles remain, necessitating further research efforts.

T2  - Cogent Economics & Finance
AB  - While there is a large body of research on the bank lending channel of monetary policy transmission and the distributional dependence of this transmission on bank characteristics, the asymmetric effect of bank capital on monetary policy—bank loan supply nexus has been ignored. To fill this void, the new post-estimation approach of marginal analysis based on the two-step system-GMM methodology is conducted for the dynamic panel data of Vietnamese commercial banks covering the period of 2007–2020. The results confirm the inertia related to loan growth and the presence of a monetary policy bank lending mechanism, which is robust across a series of monetary policy instruments and the approach of variable exclusion from the baseline model. In addition to previous empirical evidence on less sensitivity of well-capitalized banks to tightened monetary policy, this study shows the specific range value of bank capital that monetary policy stance has no impact on bank loan supply in a time of monetary restrictions. Furthermore, better capitalized banks could take more advantage of the expansionary monetary policy by lending more. The relevant policy recommendations for policy-makers are also provided to the best practice of monetary policy implementations considering these asymmetric effects.

AB  - This paper investigates the effects of Chinese financial and fiscal policies designed to counter the worldwide Great Recession of 2008. We examine how policies designed to increase bank credit and health (i.e., asset liquidity, capital adequacy ratio, profitability, and bad loan ratio) influenced firm-level output, employment and investment. We also explore the impact of China’s expansionary fiscal policy with regard to these firm-level variables. We find that the policy effects varied based on firm-level characteristics such as size, liability ratio, profitability, ownership and the industry in which the firm operates. With respect to the dynamic effects, our results suggest that Chinese financial and fiscal policies were generally effective in the short run, but their positive impacts ceased within two years.

AU  - Arestis, Philip

AB  - According to the New Consensus in monetary economics, monetarism is dead and central bankers target low inflation rates by acting upon short-term real rates of interest. Yet, this synthesis hinges on variants of the long-run vertical Phillips curve originally proposed by Milton Friedman, the father of old-line monetarism. Contributors to this volume question this New Consensus. While they agree that the money supply should be conceived as endogenous, they carefully examine the procedures pursued by central banks, the monetary policy transmission mechanisms suggested by central bankers themselves, and the assumptions imbedded in the New Consensus. They propose alternative analyses that clearly demonstrate the limits of modern central banking and point to the possible instability of monetary economies.
