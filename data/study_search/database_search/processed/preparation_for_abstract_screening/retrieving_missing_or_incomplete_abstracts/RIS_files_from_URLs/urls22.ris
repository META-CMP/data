AB  - We extend in a minimal way the stylized macroeconomic Agent-Based model introduced in our previous paper (Gualdi et al. in J Econ Dyn Control 50:29–61, 2015a), with the aim of investigating the role and efficacy of monetary policy of a ‘Central Bank’ that sets the interest rate such as to steer the economy towards a prescribed inflation and employment rate. Our major finding is that provided its policy is not too aggressive (in a sense detailed in the paper) the Central Bank is successful in achieving its goals. However, the existence of different equilibrium states of the economy, separated by phase boundaries (or “dark corners”), can cause the monetary policy itself to trigger instabilities and be counter-productive. In other words, the Central Bank must navigate in a narrow window: too little is not enough, too much leads to instabilities and wildly oscillating economies. This conclusion strongly contrasts with the prediction of DSGE models.

AB  - The Covid 19 pandemic spawned a global liquidity crisis in March 2020. The global liquidity crisis was alleviated by the Federal Reserve and other advanced country central banks cooperating by extending the swap lines they developed in the Global Financial Crisis 2007–2008. Central bank cooperation in 2020 evolved from a two-century history across several monetary regimes that is surveyed in this paper. I find that in monetary regimes which are rules-based cooperation was most successful. International currency swaps developed to manage exchange rates during the Bretton Woods era have evolved into the leading tool to manage international liquidity crises. The swap network can be viewed as a step in the direction of a global financial safety net.

AB  - This paper addresses the impact of monetary policy on banks' risk-taking by using bank-level panel data from more than 1000 banks in 29 emerging economies during 2000–2012. We find that, consistent with the proposition of the “bank risk-taking channel” of monetary policy transmission, banks' riskiness increases when monetary policy is eased. This result is robust when we adopt alternative measures of monetary policy and bank risk, and use different econometric methodologies. In addition, we find that bank risk-taking amid expansionary monetary policy is less conspicuous in a more consolidated banking sector and when monetary policy is more transparent.

AB  - Manufacturing sector refers to those industries which are involved in the manufacturing and processing of items and indulge in either creation of new commodities or in value addition. Manufacturing involves the conversion of raw material into finished consumer goods or intermediate goods. The main objective of the study is to examine the effect of monetary policy on manufacturing sector output in Nigeria. Specifically, the study evaluate the effect of monetary policy rate on manufacturing sector output in Nigeria, examine the effect of treasury bill rate on manufacturing sector output in Nigeria, access the effect of cash reserve ratio on manufacturing sector output in Nigeria and to investigate the effect of money supply on manufacturing sector output in Nigeria. Time series data covering 33 years, from 1987 to 2019 was employed. Descriptive statistics were used to explain the nature of the variables used for the analyses. The data were subjected to Augmented Dickey Fuller Stationarity Test. The results showed that all the variables have stationarity at level 1(0). Thus, the most suitable tool of regression used is the ordinary Least Square which was employed for the analysis. Our findings among others revealed that money supply; monetary policy rate and treasury bill rate have positive significant policy effects on manufacturing sector output in Nigerian while cash reserve ratio had negative and insignificant policy effect on manufacturing sector output in Nigeria. The study therefore concludes that monetary policies have positive and significant effect on manufacturing sector output in Nigeria. The study recommended amongst others that the Central Bank of Nigeria should employ an expansionary monetary policy that can increase the money supply to the real sectors to boost economic development in Nigerian. Banks should negotiate a reduced cash reserve ratio with the Central Bank of Nigeria to improve performance. The monetary authorities in Nigeria should reduce monetary policy rate to attract low interest rates that can encourage credit and boost productivity across the sectors which will improve the manufacturing sector output in Nigeria. Concerted effort should be made by policy makers to increase the level of output in Nigeria by improving productivity in order to reduce the prices of goods and services (inflation) so as to enhance economic development in Nigeria. the study therefore suggest that further studies should increase the number of years of studies to ascertain a longer term result and include other variables, such as stock market index, consumer price index, investment per capita, savings and investment, public debt and grant.

AB  - We investigate the effect of targeted reduction in reserve requirement ratio (RRR) on macro stability based on a two-sector DSGE model with heterogeneous capital-labor ratios. We derive the optimal monetary policy rule and compute the central bank’s welfare losses. A monetary policy regime with targeted reduction in RRR is more effective for welfare loss reduction. Additionally, gains are greater under the shock to micro and small enterprises (MSEs) than they are to both large and medium enterprises and MSEs. A clearer accountability regime can yield lower loss. Specifically, targeted reduction in RRR should be responsible for employment and financial stability.

T2  - Open Economies Review
AB  - A general equilibrium model of heterogeneous capital is employed to investigate whether, how and to what extent monetary policy and market structure may have contributed to the decline of the labor share in the U.S. in recent decades. By construction the model allows monetary policy to affect the labor share through two channels, i.e. one linking the policy rate to the real interest rate and another linking the latter to the useful life of producers’ goods, whereas regarding market structure, the more competitive the economy, the higher the labor share. From its solution using U.S. data over the period 2000–2014 it emerges that the persistent reduction in the policy rate on the one hand slowed down the decline in the labor share and on the other accelerated it, because the reduction in the policy rate was accompanied by a robust upward trend in the equilibrium real rate of interest, which increased the useful life of producers’ goods. In turn, to gauge the relative strength of these two opposite effects, the equation of the labor share is estimated by means of the autoregressive distributed lag method. The results show that the adverse effect of monetary policy through the useful life of producers’ goods was more than 12 times as strong as the favorable effect of the policy rate and on this ground I conclude that the monetary policy contributed to the decline of the labor share significantly, at least since 2000. As for the market structure, it is found that even if firms had and attempted to exercise monopoly power, it would be exceedingly difficult to exploit it because the demand of consumers’ goods is significantly price elastic.

T2  - African Journal of Economic and Management Studies
AB  - Purpose The study aims to investigate the role of monetary policy in encouraging economic growth through bank loans, as well as estimating the optimal monetary policy rate (MPR), which may be damaging to Ghana's economic growth if exceeded. Design/methodology/approach Using annual data spanning from 1990 to 2017, the authors used Autoregressive Distributed Lag (ARDL) econometric approach to investigate the impact of monetary policy on economic growth. Lind and Mehlum (2010) U test estimation technique is used in determining the threshold level. Findings The empirical findings demonstrated that the monetary transmission mechanism through the credit channel is poor in the long run, and the effectiveness of monetary policy is dependent on the financial sector's performance. A non-monotonic relationship between monetary and economic growth was also discovered in the study. As a result, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) should not adopt an interest rate for monetary policy that surpasses 23.7%. Practical implications Because of the non-monotonic link between MPR and economic growth, it is necessary to expand the financial market and ensure that the policy rate does not exceed the threshold level. Originality/value To the best of the authors' knowledge, this is one of the first studies to look at the MPR as a potential source of negative economic growth. The paper's findings could aid the MPC in determining the MPR. A MPR that is too high could eventually damage the financial sector and lead to economic disasters.

It shows that business formation can generate fluctuations in output, employment, investment and trade flows close to those in the data while at the same time providing positive international comovements. Simulations show that the presence of imported investment goods is essential for replicating these facts.

AB  - This paper documents that monetary policy affects credit supply through banks’ cost of funding. Using administrative credit-registry and regulatory bank data, we find that banks can incur an increase in their funding costs of at least 30 basis points before they adjust their lending. For identification, we exploit the existence of regulated-deposit accounts in France whose interest rates are set by the government and are, thus, not directly affected by the monetary-policy rate. When banks’ funding cost increases and they contract their lending, we observe portfolio reallocations consistent with risk shifting: banks that depend on regulated deposits lend less to large firms, and relatively more to small firms and entrepreneurs.

Second, do differences in companies’ financial compositions matter for real activity of firms such as inventory and employment growth? The article offers some evidence from firms in the UK manufacturing sector which suggests that the composition of debt differs considerably with characteristics such as size, age, debt and risk, it also shows a significant effect from financial composition and cash flow to inventory and employment growth.

T2  - Journal of Money, Credit and Banking
AB  - Empirical estimates of monetary policy rules suggest that the behavior of U.S. monetary policymakers changed during the past few decades. However, for that same time period, statistical analyses of lagged representations of the economy, such as VARs, often have not rejected the null of structural stability. These two sets of empirical results appear to contradict the Lucas critique. This paper reconciles these results with the Lucas critique by showing that the apparent policy invariance of reduced forms is consistent with the magnitude of historical policy shifts and the relative insensitivity of the reduced forms of plausible forward-looking macroeconomic specifications to policy shifts.

AB  - The objective of the study is to determine the impact of monetary policy on inclusive growth. The study employed multivariate regression model to establish the effect. Data was collected on PCI as proxy for inclusive growth, and exchange rate, interest rate and money supply as monetary policy tools. The OLS technique revealed a significant variation between money supply and inclusive growth which implies that it will be in the best interest of the populace if monetary policy measures are employed to effect changes in the economy.

TI  - The Spillover Effects of the US Unconventional Monetary Policy: New Evidence from Asian Developing Countries
AU  - Tran, Thi Bich Ngoc
AU  - Pham, Hoang Cam Huong
T2  - Journal of Risk and Financial Management
AB  - This paper aims to trace the monthly responses of equity prices, long-term interest rates, and exchange rates in Asian developing markets to the US unconventional monetary policy (UMP). The main research question is to explore whether UMP shocks exist in those markets. We also consider the differences in the mean responses of those asset prices between traditional and non-traditional monetary policy phases. To address such concerns, we employ a panel vector autoregression with exogenous variables (Panel VARX) model and estimate the model by the least-squares dummy variable (LSDV) estimator in three different periods spanning from 2004M2 to 2018M4. The first finding is that UMP shocks from the US are associated with a surge in equity prices, a decline in long-term interest rates, and an appreciation of currencies in Asian developing markets. In contrast, the conventional monetary policy shocks from the US seem to exert adverse effects on these recipient countries. These empirical results suggest that the policymakers in Asian developing countries should cautiously take into account the spillover effects from the US unconventional monetary policy once it is executed.

AB  - This study examined the effectiveness of monetary policy on economic growth in Nigeria within the COVID-19 period spanning from December 2019 to October 2020. Three most adjusted monetary policy instruments were employed: the monetary policy rate, the exchange rate and broad money supply, which were made the explanatory variables. The growth rate stood as the dependent variable. Granger Causality and Vector Auto-Regressive (VAR) were employed for the analysis as informed by the unit root tests. It was found that, when applied individually, monetary policy rate and exchange rate granger caused economic growth while braod money supply did not. When jointly used, all three variables granger caused economic growth. Also, It was found that, monetary policy rate and exchange rate have significant impact on economic growth while broad money supply could not have any significant impact amidst the COVID-19 Pandemic period.This study therefore, suggests that, the monetary authorities could use the instruments of monetary policy rate and exchange rate to motivate economic growth amidst pandemic periods like this.More so, pumping out money can only have significant impact when the use of such money is guided for the intervention purpose only. If not, it could end up causing serious inflation.

We begin with certain principles guiding general scientific modeling and focus on Milton Friedman's 1968 Presidential Address that delineates the strengths and limitations of monetary policy to pursue certain goals. The modeling of monetary policy with its novelty of quantitative easing to target unusually high unemployment is evaluated by a Markov switching econometric model using monthly data for the period 2002–2015. We conclude by relating the lessons learned from unconventional monetary policy during the Global Financial Crisis to the recent bold initiatives of the Fed to mitigate the economic and financial impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on U.S. households and businesses.

AB  - We investigate the transmission of central bank liquidity to bank deposits and loan spreads in Europe over the period from January 2006 to June 2010. We find evidence consistent with an impaired transmission channel due to bank risk. Central bank liquidity does not translate into lower loan spreads for high-risk banks for maturities beyond one year, even as it lowers deposit spreads for both high- and low-risk banks. This adversely affects the balance sheets of high-risk bank borrowers, leading to lower payouts, lower capital expenditures, and lower employment. Overall, our results suggest that banks’ capital constraints at the time of an easing of monetary policy pose a challenge to the effectiveness of the bank-lending channel and the central bank's lender of last resort function.

TI  - Monetary Policy Effects and Output Growth in Malawi: Using a Small Macroeconometric Model
AU  - Chavula, Hopestone Kayiska
T2  - Open Journal of Modelling and Simulation
AB  - This study tries to develop and use a small macroeconometric model to capture the main short-term macro dynamics and to forecast major macroeconomic variables of the Malawian economy. The results show that a reduction in the policy rate leads to a fall in the lending rate, but with an increase in money supply, and with an insignificant impact on output growth. The results suggest that monetary authorities in Malawi have to make a choice between the objectives of maintaining lower money supply and lowering the lending rate. The results also suggest that, despite the Reserve Bank of Malawi Act of 1989 stipulating that monetary authorities should pursue both price and high growth and employment objectives, our results reveal that price stability is the principal objective of monetary policy in the country. Suggesting that monetary authorities in the country should not only place more emphasis on the objective of stabilization and achieving low inflation, but also focus on supporting strong, sustained and shared growth. To some extent further suggesting that emphasis should be placed on policies and strategies aimed at structurally transforming the Malawian economy so that the monetary policies’ impact should translate into an increase in the country’s output and growth. Further suggesting enhanced effective coordination between fiscal and monetary policies.

AB  - This paper concerns theory and evidence of the monetary transmission mechanisms. Current research has deeply investigated factors, such as dependence of firms on bank credit, that amplify the impact of monetary policy impulses on aggregate demand exerting strong but temporary effects on output and employment. We present an intertemporal macroeconomic equilibrium model of a competitive economy where current production is financed by bank credit, and then we use it to identify supply–side effects of the credit transmission mechanism in data drawn from the Italian economy. We find evidence that the ‘credit variables’ identified by the model – the overnight rate as a proxy of monetary policy and a measure of credit risk – have permanent effects on employment and output by altering credit supply conditions to firms. To save on space, mathematical proofs, statistical tests and data sources have been gathered in two separate appendices that can be examined on request. (J.E.L.: E2, E5).

In this paper, the extant literature on the impact of external shocks on monetary policy effectiveness with reference to non-WAEMU countries is reviewed. The importance of this literature review is to provide contemporary perspectives to scholars and policymakers on the relevance of the incidence of external shocks to the effectiveness of monetary policy with reference to non-WAEMU countries. The literature reviewed in this study shows that, on the whole, the extent and the degree to which external shocks are transmitted to the domestic economy substantially depend on a plethora of features, namely the absence of exchange rate flexibility; a strong export concentration, especially with respect to commodities; the level of global economic integration; restricted capacities of production; the absence of competitiveness in exports; over-reliance on foreign aid; foreign reserves that are not adequate and capital account openness.

AB  - Private sector investment has become an increasingly significant objective for the government of Sierra Leone in promoting economic growth and enhancing job creation, and monetary policy has always been one of the main economic management tools that governments use to shape economic performance. The study therefore examines the rate at which changes in monetary policy in Sierra Leone has affected the behavior of private sector investments, theories and empirical studies are reviewed in a way to identify a suitable model for private sector investment for the period 1980 to 2014. Using recent econometric techniques, the results suggest that money supply and gross domestic saving exert positive and statistically significant effect on private sector investments whereas Treasury bill rate, inflation and gross domestic debt exert a negative effect. An important policy implication emerging from this study is to facilitate the establishment of financial institutions to increase credit delivery to the private sector so as to enhance private investment.

some level of understanding of how monetary policy decisions and actions affect inflation and output. A
structural vector error correction model (s-vecm) was developed utilising information from estimated
cointegrating relationships. Using a 7 variable system, the analysis was carried out by examining the
dynamic nature of generalized impulse response functions generated from the model. The study found
strong evidence of monetary policy instruments affecting inflation and output in the Ghanaian economy in
the long run and that the exchange rate channel remains the main medium through which monetary policy
acts.

AB  - We study the impact of the Fed's monetary policy announcements on households' expectations by comparing responses to the Survey of Consumer Expectations before and after Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meetings, over the period 2013-2019. We find that Fed decisions affect expectations of interest rates on savings accounts, particularly for respondents with high financial and numerical literacy. The effect is particularly strong in the first few days after the announcement of the decision and decays in the days that follow. The impact of monetary policy announcements on inflation expectations is muted, even in response to some of the most relevant meetings of the FOMC that took place during that period. Expectations of personal financial conditions are barely affected. Our results stand in contrast to experimental studies that find strong effects of monetary policy and other macroeconomic news on expectations of households receiving a specific treatment, suggesting that the news naturally reaching the general population may provide weaker signals.

Data on the renegotiations of collective bargaining agreements allow us to construct an exogenous measure of wage rigidity. We also find that the amplification induced by wage rigidity is stronger for firms with high labor intensity and low profitability, providing evidence of distributional consequences of monetary policy. We rationalize the evidence through a model in which firms in different sectors feature different degrees of wage rigidity due to staggered renegotiations vis-a-vis unions.

AB  - There is a growing consensus that a prolonged period of low interest rates can exert a negative impact on financial stability through the risk-taking incentives of banks. This study uses comprehensive micro-level datasets from the US banking sector that characterize both new and total loans in bank portfolios. Further, it proposes ways to overcome the difficult identification problem related to the endogeneity of monetary policy in the bank risk equations. We find that the negative relationship between monetary policy rates and bank risk-taking is both statistically and economically significant. This finding remains robust across various specifications, subperiods and subsamples, thereby confirming the presence of an active risk-taking channel of monetary policy since the 1990s. The empirical analysis also provides first-hand evidence that in the period after the eruption of the financial crisis in 2007, the relationship between monetary policy rates and bank risk-taking remains negative and highly significant, a result in line with the arguments against the too-low for too-long policy for interest rates. The results, therefore, support the new responsibilities of the Fed on macroprudential supervision to monitor systemic risks.

The empirical findings indicate that contractionary monetary policy shocks lead to transitory appreciations of the real and the nominal exchange rate. Exchange rate appreciations that are caused by a temporary contractionary shock to monetary policy are correlated with a short-lived improvement in the trade balance which is then followed by a deterioration, giving support to the J-curve hypothesis.

AB  - This paper develops a model of an electoral cycle in inflation and output based on rational inflation expectations and rational retrospective voting. Voters are heterogeneous and partially informed about aggregate macroeconomic variables. They observe precisely how monetary policy stimulates their local economies, but their observations of economic activity in other sectors are imprecise. Voters extract information about the incumbent policymaker's economic competence from cross-sectoral spillover effects. The incumbent has incentives to generate preeleetion "monetary surprises" that stimulate the local economies and generate cross-sectoral spillover effects. He thereby creates an impression of economic competence and furthers his reelection prospects. His policy ma~ nipulations are the price of political accountability. On a positive note, the incumbent is more likely to survive voter scrutiny if he is more competent than the average political candidate.

AB  - We investigate the effect of sovereign stress and of unconventional monetary policy on small firms’ financing patterns during the euro area debt crisis. We find that after the crisis started, firms in stressed countries were more likely to be credit rationed, both in the quantity and in the price dimension, and to increase their use of debt securities. We also find evidence that the announcement of the ECB’s Outright Monetary Transactions Program was followed by an immediate decline in the share of credit rationed firms and of firms discouraged from applying. In addition, firms reduced their use of debt securities, trade credit, and government subsidized loans. Firms with improved outlook and credit history were particularly likely to benefit from easier credit access.

AB  - We estimate the response of uncertainty/risk aversion to monetary policy actions in both the financial sector and the aggregate economy using a structural vector autoregressive model. When compared with other sectors, our constructs reveal that financial risk aversion/uncertainty has greater correlation with the aggregate risk aversion and uncertainty. Our analysis reveals that financial risk aversion and uncertainty exhibit stronger interdependence with monetary policy actions than aggregate uncertainty and risk aversion. Tighter monetary policy induces risk aversion and uncertainty increment in both the financial sector and the aggregate market. However, the financial sector risk aversion and uncertainty responses are of greater magnitude.

AU  - Engler, Philipp

T2  - Economic Modelling
AB  - This paper examines whether monetary expansion is a beggar-thyself or beggar-thy-neighbour policy. Obstfeld and Rogoff (1995) show that monetary expansion under producer currency pricing increases domestic and foreign overall welfare, in cases where the cross-country substitutability is high. If the cross-country substitutability is low, then monetary expansion is a beggar-thyself policy that reduces domestic welfare and increases foreign welfare (Corsetti & Pesenti 2001; Tille 2001). In this paper, we will show that regardless of whether the cross-country substitutability is high or low, monetary expansion is always a beggar-thyself policy in the short run.

AB  - The monetary authorities of advanced economies have used the Wicksellian distinction between the natural rate of interest, also called the equilibrium real rate of interest, and the rate of interest on money to explain the partial ineffectiveness of the measures taken to deal with the Great Recession. They have explained that the instrument of the rate of interest on money produces asymmetric effects. Indeed, to fight high inflation central banks can increase the level of the rate of interest on money without limits. However, if they had to fight deflation they could not lower the rate of interest on money below zero. The presence of a negative value of the natural rate of interest has been indicated by the monetary authorities to justify the limited effectiveness of monetary policy during the Great Recession. The aim of this work is to show that the Wicksellian concept of natural rate of interest cannot be used to explain the functioning of contemporary economies. The limits of this concept will be specified by using the arguments developed by Keynes and Schumpeter to emphasize the exclusively monetary nature of the rate of interest.

AU  - Ronkainen, Antti

T2  - New Political Economy
AB  - Scholars of financialisation have argued that the emergence of finance-led grow regimes requires new instruments for effective conduct of economic policy. In this scholarship, central banks have been seen as the most promising actors to utilise one of the most synergetic policies, the maintenance of high and stable prices of financial assets. Since the financial crisis of 2007–8, central banks of the developed world have adopted various unconventional monetary policy measures that serve this function. But will these unconventional measures become institutionally legitimate and institutionalised as conventional practice, as suggested necessary by scholars of financialisation? In this paper, we answer to this question by studying the institutional legitimation of the Federal Reserve’s Quantiative Easing (QE) programmes. We argue that the QE programmes have been legitimated successfully but with institutional legitimation strategies, which cause institutional pressures that question the potential of QE from becoming a regular policy instrument and practice.

AB  - Cross-country aggregate data exhibits a strong (positive) relationship between the size of the informal employment and aggregate homeownership rates. We investigate this empirical observation using a cash-in-advance model with housing markets and argue that the rate of inflation is important in explaining the nexus between informality and homeownership rates. Specifically, we uncover a novel monetary transmission mechanism and show that households with informal employment desire to economize on their short-term cash usage and avoid periodic rental payments when (i) informality is associated with constrained business investment finance, and (ii) inflation expectations are high. Our empirical and theoretical findings highlight an important interaction between the conduct of monetary policy and the performance of housing markets.

TI  - Can monetary policy affect the real economy? The dubious effectiveness of interest rate policy
AU  - Arestis, Philip
AU  - Sawyer, Malcolm
AB  - Central bankers and many economists have abandoned activist policies and monetarism and adopted in their place a new view of the role of monetary policy. This view draws on many of the tenets of more traditional theories of money - monetarism's emphasis on inflation control and skepticism about the use of easy-money policies to permanently increase output, and the Keynesian view that the total stock of money is not an important driving force behind either inflation or unemployment - yet it also takes a dim view of democratic input to the policymaking process. This brief evaluates a premise subscribed to by most central bankers: that monetary policy can be effectively used to control inflation without any permanent sacrifice in the form of reduced income or job opportunities.

TI  - Monetary policy in emerging markets: Can liability dollarization explain contractionary devaluations?
AU  - Cook, David
T2  - Journal of Monetary Economics
AB  - In emerging markets, external debt is denominated almost entirely in large, developed country currencies such as the U.S. dollar. This liability dollarization offers a channel through which exchange rate variation can lead to business cycle instability. When firms' assets are denominated in domestic currency and liabilities are denominated in foreign currency, an exchange rate depreciation worsens firms' balance sheets, which leads to higher capital costs and contractions in capital spending. To illustrate this, I construct a quantitative, sticky price, small open economy model in which a monetary policy induced devaluation leads to a persistent contraction in output. In this model, fixed exchange rates offer greater stability than an interest rule that targets inflation.

AB  - This paper argues that in reserve currency issuing economies at the effective lower bound, outright transfers from the central bank to households are both more equitable and more effective in achieving monetary policy objectives than asset purchases or negative interest rates. It shows that concerns pertaining to central banks’ policy solvency and equity position can be addressed through a careful assessment of a central bank's loss absorbing capacity and, if need be, tiered reserve remuneration policies. It also spells out key differences to a debt or money financed fiscal stimulus, which are particularly pronounced in a currency union without a central fiscal capacity. The paper concludes by discussing broader institutional, political, and legal considerations.

AB  - Monetary policy making in emerging economies have their own particular challenges. The compulsions of unique institutional details as well as the thinness of financial markets in the backdrop of increasing global integration often tends to render the monetary transmission mechanism unstable. This paper first fleshes out a number of these confounding institutional and legacy issues in the context of India. We then illustrate the consequences of these frictions for the monetary transmission mechanism with two features of the policy environment in India: statutory liquidity ratio requirements imposed on banks and chronic fiscal deficits. We show that these frictions can completely invert the monetary transmission mechanism: when the constraint binds, a reduction in the policy rate can end up raising lending spreads and thereby cause a contraction instead of an expansion in the economy.

AB  - There is widespread agreement that monetary policy matters, but there is disagreement about how policy should be conducted. Behind this disagreement lies differences in theoretical understandings. The paper contrasts the new classical, neo-Keynesian, and Post Keynesian frameworks, thereby surfacing the differences. The new classical model has policy affecting only long-run inflation. The neo-Keynesian model has policy affecting inflation, unemployment, and real wages. The Post Keynesian model also affects growth, so policy implicitly picks a quadruple. Inflation targeting is a suboptimal policy frame because it biases decisions toward low inflation by obscuring the fact that policy also affects unemployment, real wages, and growth.

We describe efforts to explain exchange rate behaviour ex post and to forecast its future evolution ex ante. We then summarise central banks' recent research on the linkage between exchange rates and inflation, output, profits and the current account. We highlight the main models and methodologies, the main empirical results and the key challenges ahead. The second part of the paper is devoted to research that examines the actual experience that countries have had in incorporating the exchange rate into their monetary policy decisions, and the main lessons learned.

TI  - Monetary Policy and Inclusive Growth: Evidence from Nigeria | Journal of Advanced Research in Business and Management Studies
AB  - The growing importance of monetary policy to governments has made an investigation of the relationship between money supply and inclusive growth in Nigeria necessary with the VAR framework employed to analyze the linkage between them. The results provided evidence that exchange rate and money supply have a significant impact on growth through unemployment and that ineffective monetary policy to stem the volatility in the exchange rate, as well as macroeconomic shocks, is responsible for non–inclusiveness of the growth experienced in the economy over the years. The economy’s absorptive capacity is so low that the economic growth experienced in the economy could not trickle down to improve the lots of the people. Therefore, it is recommended that there should be harmony between fiscal and monetary policies as expansionary monetary and fiscal policies in the past tend to worsen exchange rate depreciation. Further, monetary and fiscal policies need be coordinated appropriately and harmonized to achieve macroeconomic stability especially whereby monetary policy adjusts passively to the expansionary fiscal operations of the government. Since government spending has a direct relationship with the exchange rate, it is necessary to rationalize and restructure government expenditure towards productive activities and significantly discourage fiscal deficits.

T2  - Journal of International Money and Finance
T3  - The New Normal in the Post-Crisis Era
AB  - Unconventional monetary policy such as Quantitative Easing (QE) is often considered to have considerable spillover effects on emerging market economies (EME). Aims at quantifying these effects so far mostly use high-frequency data around announcement dates, panels or VAR models. This paper proposes an alternative way to estimate the effects of QE on emerging markets that allows us to include macroeconomic, i.e. low-frequency, data together with announcement dates. A Qual VAR is estimated that integrates binary information of QE announcements with an otherwise standard VAR, including US and emerging market variables. A key advantage is that the model accounts for the endogeneity and forecastability of QE announcements. The model uncovers the Fed's latent, unobservable propensity for QE and generates impulse responses for EME variables to QE shocks. The results suggest that QE has significant effects on EME's financial conditions and plays a sizable role in explaining capital inflows, equity prices and exchange rates.

T2  - Review of Political Economy
AB  - This article expands on the debate of whether merely controlling inflation can be considered a good outcome in terms of monetary policy, discussing proposals for adopting alternative monetary targets (e.g., price level, nominal GDP), alternative instruments (e.g., monetary finance, central bank digital currencies), for enlarging central banks' mandates (e.g., incorporating employment, wages, inequality, environmental objectives) and for the design of future monetary policy frameworks.We argue that in the coming years, central banks should not simply maintain their pre-2008 standards by de-implementing unconventional monetary policies. Instead, they must take advantage of their past and recent experiences in order to improve, under an evolutionary perspective, future monetary policy and financial stability frameworks. Based on this, measures implemented since the 2008 crisis would have three possible treatments in new frameworks: i) be discarded, due to their predominantly adverse effects; ii) not be regularly implemented, but be used as backstop mechanisms if needed; iii) be incorporated as regular measures of monetary policy/financial stability frameworks. Accordingly, monetary and financial stability authorities will increasingly need to evolve and engage in a continuously adaptive and innovative process in order to face challenges posed by financial markets that are becoming more dynamic, innovative, complex, interconnected and globalised.

AB  - The dangers of high capital flow volatility and sudden stops have led economists to promote the use of capital controls as an addition to monetary policy in emerging market economies. This paper studies the benefits of capital controls and monetary policy in a small open economy with financial frictions, nominal rigidities, and sudden stops. Without commitment, the optimal monetary policy should sharply diverge from price stability. The policymakers will also tax capital inflows in a crisis, but such taxes may be welfare reducing. With commitment, capital controls involve a mix of current capital inflow taxes and future capital flow subsidies. The optimal policy will never involve macro-prudential capital inflow taxes or a departure from price stability, whether or not commitment is available.

In a heterogeneous ﬁrm New Keynesian model with ﬁnancial frictions and endogenous debt maturity, two channels explain this ﬁnding: (1.) Firms with more maturing debt have larger rollover needs and are therefore more exposed to ﬂuctuations in the real interest rate (roll-over risk). (2.) These ﬁrms also have higher default risk and therefore react more strongly to changes in the real burden of outstanding nominal debt (debt overhang). In comparison to existing models, we show that a model which accounts for the maturity of debt and its distribution across ﬁrms implies larger aggregate eﬀects of monetary policy.

TI  - Economic Interdependence, Relative Gains, and International Cooperation: The Case of Monetary Policy Coordination
AU  - Suzuki, Motoshi
T2  - International Studies Quarterly
AB  - To date, no systematic study has yet examined whether economic interdependence is a structural determinant of international cooperation. Using a two-state monetary policy interaction model, I examine a cooperative equilibrium under a wide range of circumstances in which shifts occur in the level of interdependence as well as in the extent of relative gains concerns and the length of the shadow of the future. The analysis reveals that the level of interdependence influences each state's ability to pursue balancing behavior which prevents the other state from gaining a disproportionate advantage. In two-state interaction, the deleterious impact of relative gains on cooperation diminishes progressively under growing interdependence. The result refines liberal institutionalism by suggesting that cooperation is possible even if states' preferences contain relative gains concerns. Also, the result modifies Snidal's (1991a, 1991b) recent finding that the impact of relative gains attenuates in large-n interactions, while relative gains still impede cooperation in two-state PD cases. I show that a similar attenuation of the relative gain impact can arise in two-state interaction under high interdependence. The recent experiences of the Group of Seven (G-7) states support the liberal institutionalist hypothesis that there exists a positive relationship between the level of economic interdependence and the degree of monetary policy cooperation.

The study employs the S&P/Case-Shiller aggregate 10 city monthly housing price index, available in the period 1987–2010/8, the 20 city monthly housing price index for 2000–2010/8, and the federal funds rate data for the period 1987–2010/8. The findings are consistent with the view that the interest rate policy of the Federal Reserve in the period 2001–2004 that pushed down the federal funds rate and kept it artificially low was a cause of the housing price bubble.

AB  - The impact of news releases related to the inflation targeting regime on the financial market is analyzed by estimating a bivariate VAR GARCH-BEKK-in-mean model. We use daily data, from January 2006 to May 2017, of stock prices index (IBOVESPA), exchange rate (BRL/USD) and interbank deposit rate (DI360). We developed a positive and negative news index to measure the impact of news releases based on Caporale et al. (2016) and Caporale et al. (2018). Although the literature on the subject is vast, this paper fills relevant gaps in three ways. First, we investigate the bidirectional relationship between monetary policy related news releases and the behavior of asset prices before and after the 2008 crisis in Brazil. Second, we consider the relationship between the second moments of the variables of interest, using the conditional volatility as a proxy for uncertainty. Third, we provide a time series approach to measure the effect of macroeconomic related news releases on financial asset returns. The results indicate there are mean spread effects from news for the exchange rate and the Brazilian stock index: (i) the GARCH-in-mean parameter is statistically significant for positive and the difference of news for the DI360; (ii) monetary policy and external shocks are statiscally significant as expected with exception of the external shocks for the Brazilian stock index; and (iii) there are volatility spillovers and changes of this volatility after the crisis for stock index and DI360.

T2  - Metroeconomica
AB  - This paper addresses the ability of central banks to affect the structure of interest rates. We assess the causal relationship between the short-term Effective Federal Funds Rate (FF) and long-term interest rates associated with both public and private bonds and specifically, the 10-Year Treasury Bond (GB10Y) and the Moody's Aaa Corporate Bond (AAA). To do this, we apply Structural Vector Autoregressive models to U.S. monthly data for the 1954–2018 period. Based on results derived from impulse response functions and forecast error variance decomposition, we find: a bidirectional relationship when GB10Y is considered as the long-term rate and a unidirectional relationship that moves from short- to long-term interest rates when AAA is considered. These conclusions show that monetary policy is able to permanently affect long-term interest rates and the central bank has a certain degree of freedom in setting the levels of the short-term policy rate.

AU  - Zungu, Lindokuhle Talent

T2  - Social Sciences
AB  - In response to the “Great Recession and Global Financial Crisis”, central banks had to deploy unconventional monetary policies (UMP) in order to fight the severe impact of the crisis. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to examine the dynamic shock of unconventional monetary policies through earning heterogeneity, income composition, and portfolio channels on income inequality in emerging economies covering the period 2000–2019, using the panel vector autoregressive (PVAR) model. A PVAR model was designed for this study because of its ability to address the dynamics of numerous entities considered in parallel. The findings suggest that the UMPs used by these countries’ central banks may have increased income inequality through all of the channels investigated in this study, as a shock to unconventional monetary policy results in a positive response in income inequality. Even when pre-tax income, held by the top 10%, is adopted to measure income inequality, the study yields similar results. It is evident that a central bank’s objective is and should be to fulfil its mandate of achieving maximum employment and price stability, thus bringing wide economic benefits. Thus, some forms of policies are more appropriate for addressing concerns about inequality (income policy or fiscal policy) than others. However, the current study alerts the central bank to the fact that monetary policies may have a wounding impact on income inequality. Therefore, the central banks should consider the cost of monetary policies on income inequality when drafting or implementing these kinds of policies.

AB  - The first purpose of this paper is to present the compilation procedure of the Asset- Liability-Matrix (ALM) from the Flow-of-Funds (FOF) accounts in the balance sheet format that is widely available in IMF member countries. The introduction of ALM into the framework of FOF analysis enables us to utilize the affluent assets of input-output analysis, notably the concept of Leontief inverse. The second purpose of this article is to demonstrate the application of ALM to the examination of the quantitative monetary policy introduced by the Bank of Japan (BOJ) in March 2001. It can be said, as a conclusion, that there was a tactical error in the quantitative monetary policy adopted by BOJ in terms of the combination of money market operations. We believe that the ALM framework of FOF analysis is a powerful and practical device to fulfil this kind of examination.

AU  - Nelson, Edward
T2  - Journal of Money, Credit and Banking
AB  - This paper analyzes Milton Friedman's (1968a) article “The Role of Monetary Policy,” via a discussion of seven fallacies concerning the article. These fallacies are as follows: (i) “The Role of Monetary Policy” was Friedman's first public statement of the natural rate hypothesis. (ii) The Friedman–Phelps Phillips curve was already present in Samuelson and Solow's (1960) analysis. (iii) Friedman's specification of the Phillips curve was based on perfect competition and no nominal rigidities. (iv) Friedman's (1968a) account of monetary policy in the Great Depression contradicted the Monetary History’s version. (v) Friedman (1968a) stated that a monetary expansion will keep the unemployment rate and the real interest rate below their natural rates for two decades. (vi) The zero lower bound on nominal interest rates invalidates the natural rate hypothesis. (vii) Friedman's (1968a) treatment of an interest-rate peg was refuted by the rational expectations revolution. The discussion lays out the reasons why each of these seven items is a fallacy and infers key aspects of the framework underlying Friedman's (1968a) analysis.

AB  - The slow growth and high unemployment that prevailed during much of the period 1955-1965 was, in general, attributed to the tight monetary policy and the lack of responsiveness of the monetary authorities to the needs of the economy. In this paper we use the tools of macroeconomic analysis. a general equilibrium macro-econometric model, to simulate the effects of alternative monetary policies during this controversial period. The simulations performed using the CANDIDE econometric model suggest, not surprisingly, that easier monetary conditions would have significantly improved the performance of the Canadian economy in this controversial period, in terms of both employment and output. The results also indicate that the costs of such policy, in terms of price increases, would have been relatively small.

It attempts to deal with several questions raised by the domestic ineffectiveness and unintended global results of the United States’ policy of quantitative easing. Our analysis shows that in a world of truly free capital mobility, the effects of monetary policy may be different — typically weaker — than in a closed economy. Restrictions on free capital may therefore be advantageous.

AU  - Mehrotra, Neil R

AB  - The slow recovery of the US labor market and the observed shift in the Beveridge curve has prompted speculation that sector-speciﬁc shocks are responsible for the current recession. We document a signiﬁcant correlation between shifts in the US Beveridge curve in postwar data and periods of elevated sectoral shocks relying on a factor analysis of sectoral employment to derive our sectoral shock index. We provide conditions under which sector-speciﬁc shocks in a multisector model augmented with labor market search generate outward shifts in the Beveridge curve and raise the natural rate of unemployment. Consistent with empirical evidence, our model also generates cyclical movements in aggregate matching function eﬃciency and mismatch across sectors. We calibrate a two-sector version of our model and demonstrate that a negative shock to construction employment calibrated to match employment shares can fully account for the outward shift in the Beveridge curve. We augment our standard multisector model with ﬁnancial frictions to demonstrate that ﬁnancial shocks or a binding zero lower bound can act like sectoral productivity shocks, generating a shift in the Beveridge curve that may be counteracted by expansionary monetary policy.

A monetary expansion and a positive productivity shock increase bank leverage and risk. Risk-based capital requirements amplify the cycle and are welfare detrimental. Within a class of simple policy rules, the best combination includes mildly anticyclical capital ratios (as in Basel III) and a response of monetary policy to asset prices or bank leverage.

TI  - Monetary Policy in Sudden Stop-Prone Economies
AU  - Coulibaly, Louphou
AB  - Monetary policy procyclicality is a pervasive feature of emerging market economies. In this paper, we propose a parsimonious theory explaining this fact in a model where access to foreign financing depends on the real exchange rate and the government lacks commitment. The discretionary monetary policy is procyclical to mitigate balance sheet effects originating from exchange rate depreciations during sudden stops. Committing to an inflation targeting regime is found to increase social welfare and reduce the frequency of financial crises, despite increasing their severity. Finally, the ability to use capital controls induces a less procyclical discretionary monetary policy and delivers higher welfare gains than an inflation targeting regime by reducing both the frequency and the severity of crises.

T2  - Journal of Contemporary African Studies
AB  - This study investigated the key monetary policy determinants of economic recovery, confirmed the optimum monetary policy target, and assessed the moderating role of fiscal policy in achieving economic growth in Nigeria. A plucking model of Friedman was estimated with Markov-switching, while threshold regression techniques were employed to confirm the monetary policy rate that can ensure economic recovery. Quarterly data, sourced from the National Bureau of Statistics and the Central Bank of Nigeria, between 2010:Q1 and 2019:Q1 were utilised. The results showed a significant asymmetry in the growth cycles with both monetary and fiscal policy found to be pro-cyclical, while increase in reserves in the regime of slow economic growth was not found to be growth supportive. The threshold analyses show that the Treasury Bill rate is pro-economic growth when monetary policy rate is at least 7.8%. While the Treasury Bill is a better monetary instrument that can deliver improved economic growth in Nigeria, the study recommends pro-cyclical policy coordination between monetary and fiscal policy to achieve economic recovery in Nigeria.

AB  - This study aims to determine the influence of monetary policy on the unemployment rate in Indonesia. Unemployment is one of the fundamental problems in the economy. The unemployment problem can be overcome by monetary policy. This study used time series data with the period 1975-2016 using real money demand, economic growth, real interest rates, and real exchange rates as independent variables, and the unemployment rate as the dependent variable. The data used in this study is secondary data obtained from the World Bank. The method used is ARDL (Autoregressive Distributed Lag) which can change a static economic theory to be dynamic by taking into account the role of time explicitly. The results show that in the long run the probability value of the economic growth variable is below the 5% significance level which indicates that economic growth had a negative and significant effect on the unemployment rate. In the short run, the real interest rate, the real interest rate at lag 1, economic growth at lag 1 and lag 3, and the real exchange rate at lag 1 had a negative and significant effect on the unemployment rate. This indicates that the impact of monetary policy on the unemployment rate is temporary.Keywords: Unemployment Rate, Monetary Policy, ARDL.JEL : E24, E52, E61.

AB  - This paper investigates how unemployment persistence affects the optimal delegation of monetary policy to an independent central banker (CB). Two opposing forces are shown to be at work: with more persistence, the government’s incentive to stabilize the economy is greater; but (if the CB is forward-looking) its incentive to create inflation surprises is also greater. We show that, owing to the second effect, the government may wish not to delegate at all, unlike the case where there is no persistence. In the event that the government does delegate, the paper identifies conditions under which either effect dominates in the government’s choice of conservatism of the CB. We compare delegation to discretion and precommitment, using a diagrammatic approach that may be of independent interest. We also present some preliminary empirical evidence on the cross-country relationship between unemployment persistence and inflation that appears consistent with the model’s predictions.

AB  - This paper examines the link between unemployment and monetary policy in Nigeria using a vector autoregressive (VAR) framework for the period 1983q1 – 2014q1. The paper investigates the effect of structural change by identifying three structural breakpoints and incorporating them into the VAR model as dummy variables. The results show that a positive shock to policy rate raises unemployment over a 10 quarter period. In addition, all the variables used as proxy in the model jointly Granger cause unemployment, implying the existence of a dynamic relationship between monetary policy and unemployment in Nigeria.

TI  - Measuring the asymmetric pass-through of monetary policy rate to unemployment in Nigeria: Evidence from nonlinear ARDL

AB  - Given the persistent rise in the rate of unemployment in Nigeria over time despite the frequent changes in the monetary policy rate (MPR) and the fact that most studies in the literature simply assume a linear relationship in considering the pass-through of monetary policy instruments to unemployment, the current study investigated the asymmetric pass-through of monetary policy rate to unemployment in Nigeria using the asymmetric ARDL model over the period 2000Q1-2018Q4. The study found dissimilar long-run effects of tightening and easing the MPR on unemployment. While tightening the MPR had positive, elastic and statistically significant effect on unemployment, implying complete pass-through, easing the MPR had negative, inelastic and statistically insignificant effect on unemployment, suggesting incomplete pass-through. Similarly, the short-run effects of tightening or easing the MPR were dissimilar. Furthermore, the result of the cumulative multiplier indicated that the cumulative effects of tightening the MPR on unemployment dominated the cumulative effects of easing the MPR on unemployment in Nigeria. It is therefore recommended that to curb unemployment using the interest rate channel, the monetary authority (Monetary Policy Committee) should ease the MPR by a higher magnitude compared to the magnitude that is required to tighten it for the purpose of price stability.

TI  - Effect of monetary policy shocks on the racial unemployment rates in the US
AU  - Bennani, Hamza
T2  - Economic Systems
AB  - This study analyzes the effect of monetary policy shocks on the unemployment rate of different racial groups in the US, using data from 1969Q2 to 2015Q4. Employing a narrative approach to identify monetary policy shocks and local projections, we find that although an expansionary monetary shock affects White workers positively and significantly, the effect on Black workers is larger, and for Hispanic workers it is not statistically different from zero. These results are robust when considering unconventional monetary policy measures in the specification, and when exploring the impact of monetary policy on different genders and age groups. We also highlight how recession affects the transmission channel of monetary policy to the labor market for White and Hispanic workers. Finally, further extensions suggest that the Fed’s monetary policy is effective in reducing the racial unemployment gap, particularly between Whites and Blacks, and during economic booms.

TI  - Unemployment and monetary policy under rational expectations: Some Canadian evidence
AU  - Wogin, Gillian
T2  - Journal of Monetary Economics
AB  - The policy implications of combining rational expectations with the natural rate of unemployment hypothesis are reviewed. A monetary policy feedback rule is estimated on Canadian data for the period 1927–1972. The residuals from the regression serve as the unanticipated components of monetary policy while predicted values serve as expected monetary growth. An unemployment equation is then developed in which the unemployment rate is allowed to be influenced by expected and unexpected monetary policy and fiscal and foreign spending. The evidence confirms the hypothesis that it is unanticipated monetary policy that affects unemployment and that anticipated monetary growth plays no significant role.

AB  - We discover a consumption channel of monetary policy in a model with money and government bonds. When the central bank withdraws government bonds (short-term or long-term) through open market operations, it lowers returns on bonds. The lower return has a direct negative impact on consumption by households that hold bonds and an indirect negative impact on consumption by households that hold money. As a result, firms earn less profits from production, which leads to higher unemployment. The existence of such a consumption channel can help us understand the effects of unconventional monetary policy.
