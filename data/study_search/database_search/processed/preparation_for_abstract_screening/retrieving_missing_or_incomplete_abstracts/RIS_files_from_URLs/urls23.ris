AB  - Models of unemployment and monetary policy usually assume constant participation. Incorporating a participation decision into a standard New Keynesian model with matching frictions, we show that market tightness becomes endogenously more volatile because both the opportunity cost of home production and the reservation wage vary with participation. The model can simultaneously explain the low volatility of participation, the high volatility of unemployment, and a procyclical workers׳ outside option of working. A policy of strict inflation targeting is close to optimal, and increasing the response of the interest rate to inflation does not have a large impact on the volatility of unemployment because of the endogenous response of participation.

TI  - Monetary policy and unemployment in the Republic of serbia
AU  - Veselinović, Nevena
T2  - Industrija
AB  - The main objective of the examination is to conclude whether monetary policy can influence the unemployment rate through the key policy rate and to analyze the relationship between inflation and unemployment in the Republic of Serbia, considering that the mentioned occurrences are major destabilizers of the developing economy. The Vector error correction model is used as the central model for inquiring the structure of the time series. From the cointegration equation of the VEC model, it can be concluded that there is no long-run equilibrium dynamic between the key policy rate and the unemployment rate in the Republic of Serbia over the period 2009M1-2019M6. Regarding the relationship between inflation and unemployment, there is a positive statistically significant effect of the inflation rate to the unemployment rate in the long-term. In the short term, results indicate that the key policy rate, as well as the inflation rate, do not cause the unemployment rate in the observed period.

TI  - The Impact of Fiscal and Monetary Policy on Unemployment Rate in Nigeria
AU  - Onwuka, Chinonye Emmanuel
AB  - This study empirically examined the impact of fiscal and monetary policy on unemployment rate using data between the periods 1981 to 2020 by the use of Vector Autoregressive (VAR) model as the major statistical technique of analysis. The data used for the study were annual time series secondary data sourced from Central Bank Statistical Bulletin (CBN) and National Bureau of Statistics (NBS). From the findings, the coefficient of determination (R2) is 0.652 which shows that about 65 percent variations in the unemployment rate were explained by the independent variables. Also, its adjusted counterpart is 0.602 and its shows that about 60 percent growth in unemployment rate can be explained by the independent variables. The unit root test results indicated that all the variables were stationary at first difference and co-integration test confirmed a long run relationship among the variables. The F-stat value of 4.445 confirms that the overall test is significant. The AR root test confirms that the estimated model is stable. Also, the serial correlation LM test and heteroskedacity test confirm that there is no autocorrelation and heteroskedacity in the model. The findings show that government expenditure and interest rate has negative and significant effect on unemployment rate at lag period 2. Government tax was found to be negative and insignificant at lag period 2. Money supply was found to have a positive and significant at lag period 1. By implication, the findings show that government expenditure, money supply and interest rate are major determinants of unemployment rate in Nigeria since they were found to be statistically significant. Also, the impulse response function of unemployment shows that unemployment rate that has a negative relationship with its past values from periods except in the first, 2nd, 3rd, 4th and 5th periods. Furthermore, from the forecast error variance decomposition (FEVD), it is obvious that the highest innovation was due to government tax and money supply, while the shock of government expenditure and interest rate in Nigeria were the lowest over the periods. The study concludes that there is need for diverse strategies that will be targeted towards employment creation in Nigeria. Thus, an expansionary fiscal and monetary policy should be encouraged to support employment generation in the country.

AB  - This paper develops a positive model of monetary policy that allows for persistent unemployment and electoral uncertainty. The common credibility problem associated with low-inflation monetary policy results in both a more severe inflation bias and a stabilization bias. However, a simple state contingent performance contract eliminates both biases. Monetary policy is also subject to two different strategic political considerations: It is used to influence future policy decisions as well as to increase the incumbent party's probability of re-election. This results in a political business cycle which, however, is fundamentally different for left-wing and right-wing governments.

AB  - . The main purpose of the article was to establish the effects of monetary policy on unemployment in Namibia. The article used the structural VAR methodology in a macroeconometric setting to achieve this. The results show that monetary policy affects unemployment in Namibia in the short run and in the long run, it is ineffective. These results differ from the results by Alexius & Holmlund (2007) and Jacobs et al. (2003) who found that monetary policy has a significant role to play in explaining unemployment in both the short run and the long run. This means that there is still need to investigate the other explanations of long run unemployment in Namibia such as the demand and supply related variables so that appropriate policies are propounded to address it effectively.Keywords.

AB  - This paper studies the transmission of monetary shocks to state unemployment rates, within a novel structural factor-augmented VAR framework with a time-varying propagation mechanism. We find evidence of large heterogeneity over time in the responses of state unemployment rates to monetary policy shocks, which do not necessarily comply with the response of the national unemployment rate. We also find evidence of heterogeneity over the spatial dimension, although geographical proximity seems to play an important role in the transmission of monetary shocks.

AB  - This paper examines the precision of conventional estimates of the NAIRU and the role of the NAIRU and unemployment in forecasting inflation. The authors find that, although there is a clear empirical Phillips relation, the NAIRU is imprecisely estimated, forecasts of inflation are insensitive to the NAIRU, and there are other leading indicators of inflation that are at least as good as unemployment. This suggests deemphasizing the NAIRU in public discourse about monetary policy and instead drawing on a richer variety of leading indicators of inflation.

AB  - This paper shows that daily Google trends can be used as an alternative to conventional U.S. data (with alternative frequencies) on unemployment, interest rates, inflation and coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). This information is used to investigate the effects of COVID-19 and the corresponding monetary policy on the U.S. unemployment, both nationally and across U.S. states, by using a structural vector autoregression model. Historical decomposition analyses show that the U.S. unemployment is mostly explained by COVID-19, whereas the contribution of monetary policy is almost none. An investigation based on the U.S. states further suggests that COVID-19 and the corresponding monetary policy conducted based on nationwide economic developments have resulted in unequal changes in state-level unemployment rates, suggesting evidence for distributive effects of national monetary policy.

Other variables of interest, economic growth and exchange rate are also significant in explaining unemployment. We use the findings of our study to propose that the South African Reserve Bank(SARB) should consider revising its objectives so that they can consider getting involved in targeting unemployment so that they help nurse the economy from the wounds of high inequality and poverty.

The Phillips curve implies that demand-induced changes in inflation tend to lag behind movements in the unemployment rate, which means that a comparison between the actual unemployment rate and the NAIRU may be helpful in forecasting future changes in inflation. By using an unobserved component model with a Kalman filter we estimate the NAIRU for three countries in the euro area. Moreover, using a Markov switching model we investigate whether European monetary policy is responsible for these unemployment gaps and whether the interest rate is transmitted asymmetrically across countries.

AB  - In standard macroeconomic models, the two objectives in the Federal Reserve’s dual mandate—full employment and price stability—are closely intertwined. We motivate and estimate an alternative model in which long-term unemployment varies endogenously over the business cycle but does not affect price inflation. In this new model, an increase in long-term unemployment as a share of total unemployment creates short-term tradeoffs for optimal monetary policy and a wedge in the dual mandate. In particular, faced with high long-term unemployment following the Great Recession, optimal monetary policy would allow inflation to overshoot its target more than in standard models.

TI  - Monetary Policy and the German Unemployment Problem in Macroeconomic Models: Theory and Evidence
AU  - Gottschalk, Jan
AB  - Having the high unemployment in Germany in mind, this book discusses how macroeconomic theory has evolved over the past forty years. It shows that in recent years a convergence has taken place, with modern models embodying a Keynesian transmission mechanism, monetarist policy implication, and modeling techniques inspired by new classical economics and real business cycle theory. It also probes in which direction models may be extended from here. Empirically, the book uses different econometric techniques to investigate the relevance and implications of different macroeconomic theories for German data. A key question this book investigates is the role of demand and supply side conditions for the increase in the German unemployment rate. On a policy level, the book relates the implications of the different theories to the ongoing debate on the appropriate roles of demand and supply side policies for curing the German unemployment problem.

TI  - How relevant is monetary policy to explain Mexican unemployment fluctuations?
AU  - Islas-Camargo, Alejandro
AU  - Cortez, Willy W.
AB  - In this paper we analyze the effects of a monetary policy shock on Mexican unemployment rates. Unlike previous studies we re-estimate unemployment rates so that these alternative rates are comparable to those of the OECD member countries. We find that in response to tightening monetary policy, unemployment increases with a characteristic hump-shaped pattern found in other studies. Our empirical results indicate that unemployment elasticity is low and yet the velocity of adjustment to return to the initial point is rather high. We interpret these findings as being the result of two characteristics of Mexico’s labor market: (i) high labor regulation (which includes labor intervention in hiring-firing decisions), and (ii) the existence of a large informal sector and low enforcement of labor regulation.

T2  - Journal of Labor Economics
AB  - Monetary union, such as the Economic and Monetary Union in Europe (EMU), may affect incentives for labor market reform, and thus equilibrium unemployment, through several mechanisms. If an inflation bias exists, there is usually a stronger incentive to reduce equilibrium unemployment through national reform outside rather than inside the EMU. Absent such a bias, EMU membership could lead to more reform. One reason is that reform may increase wage flexibility, which can substitute for monetary policy in the EMU. Another reason could be a precautionary motive for low equilibrium unemployment to reduce the utility cost of increased macroeconomic variability in the EMU.

AB  - Firms and consumers both hold significant amounts of money, and the firm share changes over time and is negatively correlated with inflation. While existing studies of monetary policy and unemployment only consider consumer money, we build a quantitative framework of money allocation between consumers and firms. The quantitative results show that incorporating firm money greatly amplifies the effect of monetary policy on unemployment, and that an increase in inflation reduces the firm money share. The positive spillover effect from consumer money to firm money proves quantitatively important in accounting for changes in firm money.

Theoretical considerations as well as previous empirical work suggest that the SNB’s shift to a more inflation-targeted policy should have increased real-wage flexibility and lowered the NAIRU, the sacrifice ratio, and the level and persistence of inflation in Switzerland. Our results tend to confirm these expectations, although a number of the measured effects are not statistically significant.

TI  - Distributional Effects of Monetary and Fiscal Policy: Impacts on Unemployment Rates Disaggregated By Race and Gender
AU  - Abell, John D.
T2  - The American Journal of Economics and Sociology
AB  - Abstract. The use of vectorautoregression techniques provides empirical verification that monetary and fiscal policies do not have equal impacts on unemployment rates disaggregated by race and gender. In general, it was found that white males benefited from macro-policies more than any other category. However, black females were also shown to benefit significantly. Results were reported from both the 1970s and 1980s and indicate that these differential unemployment rate responses became magnified during the 1980s. The results for white males are consistent with a number of theories that have been offered by several writers, but the results for black females might seem, at first, to be difficult to explain. However, a close inspection of educational attainment scotes for black women over recent decades reveals a potential source of this finding.

TI  - Unemployment Fluctuations and Stabilization Policies: A New Keynesian Perspective
AU  - Gali, Jordi
AB  - A new approach for introducing unemployment into the New Keynesian framework.The past fifteen years have witnessed the rise of the New Keynesian model as a framework of reference for the analysis of fluctuations and stabilization policies. That framework, which combines the rigor and internal consistency of dynamic general equilibrium models with such typically Keynesian assumptions as monopolistic competition and nominal rigidities, makes possible a meaningful, welfare-based analysis of the effects of monetary policy rules. But the conspicuous absence of unemployment from the standard New Keynesian model has given rise to both criticism and attempts to rectify this anomaly. In this book, Jordi Galí, one of the major contributors to the New Keynesian literature, offers a new approach to introducing unemployment into that framework. Galí's approach involves a reinterpretation of the labor market in the standard New Keynesian model with staggered wage setting (rather than a modification or extension of the model, as has been proposed by others). The resulting framework preserves the convenience of the representative household paradigm and allows one to determine the equilibrium levels of employment, the labor force, and hence the unemployment rate conditional on the monetary policy in place. Galí develops the basic model, embedding it in a standard New Keynesian framework with staggered price and wage setting; revisits the relationship between economic fluctuations and efficiency through the lens of the new model, developing a measure of the output gap; and analyzes the relation between unemployment and the design of monetary policy.

AB  - We use county-level unemployment data and data derived from FOMC meeting transcripts to test the hypothesis that monetary policymakers are influenced by economic conditions in regions that they represent. The analysis confirms that regional conditions affect the policy preferences of Reserve Bank presidents. Regional conditions also appear to influence Governors, but the evidence is weaker. For all FOMC members, we find that national conditions matter more than regional conditions; however, we are unable to verify that the evolving regional composition of the Committee's voting membership has any effect on the adopted policy stance.

TI  - Monetary Policy and the Racial Unemployment Rates in the US
AU  - Bennani, Hamza
AB  - This paper analyses the eﬀects of monetary policy on labor market responses of diﬀerent racial groups in the US from 1970-2013. Employing a narrative approach to identify monetary policy shocks and local projections, we ﬁnd that monetary policy has a signiﬁcant impact on White’s unemployment rate. Empirical evidence indicates that an accommodative monetary shock aﬀects positively and signiﬁcantly White workers, while the eﬀect on African-American workers is more uncertain and not signiﬁcant for the Hispanic workers. These results are robust when considering unconventional monetary policy measures in the speciﬁcation and when exploring the impact of monetary policy on diﬀerent genders and age groups. Finally, we highlight that these results are mainly driven by a “recession eﬀect”, whereby as a result of occupational, segregation minorities do not beneﬁt from the Federal Reserve’s accommodative monetary policy during recessions. Our ﬁndings suggest that monetary policy is ineﬀective in reducing the unemployment gap among minorities in the US, and that the Fed should speciﬁcally target the African-American unemployment rate in its reaction function. Finally, structural policies that aim to improve the skills of minorities and the ﬁght against racial discrimination in the labor market, in particular during recessions, are also likely to mitigate the racial unemployment gap.

AB  - This paper intends to make research on the relationship between monetary policy and unemployment of the United States from the first quarter of 1983 to the second quarter of 2018. Data is collected and later divided into two groups, namely an ex-crisis group and a post-crisis group, based on the event of the 2008 world financial crisis. This paper uses an extended version of the original Taylor’s rule by adding the concept of unemployment degree. The results suggest that in both periods, the unemployment gap degree does make a positive impact on the Fed interest rate and has a constantly significant impact on the Fed rate. As a result, Central Banks should adopt an easy monetary policy to stimulate the domestic economy from recession.

AB  - To what extent did deviations from the Taylor rule between 2002 and 2006 help to promote price stability and maximum sustainable employment? To address that question, I estimate a New Keynesian model with unemployment and perform a counterfactual experiment where monetary policy strictly follows a Taylor rule over the period 2002:Q1–2006:Q4. I find that such a policy would have generated a sizeable increase in unemployment and resulted in an undesirably low rate of inflation. Around mid-2004, when the counterfactual deviates the most from the actual series, the model indicates that the probability of an unemployment rate greater than 8% would have been as high as 80%, whereas the probability of an inflation rate above 1% would have been close to zero.

AB  - We provide a new channel through which monetary policy has distributional consequences at business cycle frequencies. We show that an unexpected monetary easing increases labor income inequality between high-skilled and less-skilled workers. To rationalize these findings, we build a New Keynesian DSGE model with asymmetric search-and-matching (SAM) frictions and capital-skill complementarity (CSC) in production. We show that CSC on its own introduces a dynamic demand amplification mechanism: the increase in high-skilled employment after a monetary expansion makes complementary capital more productive, encouraging a further rise in investment demand and creating a multiplier effect. SAM asymmetries magnify this channel.

In sharp contrast to leading New Keynesian models, we do not impose wage inertia. Instead we derive wage inertia from our specification of how firms and workers negotiate wages. Our model outperforms a variant of the standard New Keynesian Calvo sticky wage model. According to our estimated model, there is a critical interaction between the degree of price stickiness, monetary policy, and the duration of an increase in unemployment benefits.

AB  - This paper argues that the rate of equilibrium unemployment depends on the objectives of the Central Bank. In a model where the Central Bank uses monetary policy to stabilise the economy, we show that unemployment and inflation will be lower with an inflation target than with targets for output, money or nominal GDP. The intuition for this is that the elasticities of demand in both the product and the labour markets are greater when there is an inflation target; we show that this leads to a lower mark-up of price over marginal cost and makes wages more sensitive to unemployment.

TI  - Monetary Policy and Uncertainty about the Natural Unemployment Rate: Brainard-Style Conservatism versus Experimental Activism
AU  - Volker, Wieland
T2  - The B.E. Journal of Macroeconomics
AB  - Inflation-targeting central banks have only imperfect knowledge about the effect of policy decisions on inflation. An important source of uncertainty is the relationship between inflation and unemployment. This paper studies the optimal monetary policy in the presence of uncertainty about the natural unemployment rate, the short-run inflation-unemployment tradeoff and the degree of inflation persistence in a simple macroeconomic model that incorporates rational learning by the central bank as well as market participants. Two conflicting motives drive the optimal policy. In the static version of the model, uncertainty provides a motive for the policymaker to move more cautiously than she would if she knew the true parameters. In the dynamic version, uncertainty also motivates an element of experimentation in policy. The optimal policy, which balances the cautionary and activist motives, is computed using empirical estimates of Phillips curve uncertainty. Experimentation matters quantitatively for moderate to high degrees of uncertainty. Nevertheless, gradual inflation stabilization typically remains optimal, that is, the optimal policy response to inflation is less aggressive than a policy that disregards parameter uncertainty. Exceptions occur when uncertainty is very high and inflation close to target.

AB  - Recent applied macroeconomic research has been concerned with the effects of both labor market reforms and the delegation of monetary policy to an inflation-averse central bank as ways of improving inflation and unemployment outcomes. The experiences of the UK following the introduction of changes to the labor market in the 1980s and of inflation targeting and instrument independence for the Bank of England in the 1990s, have often been held up as illustrations of the beneficial effects of regime changes of this sort. Others have contradicted these views, including those who have drawn attention to the weakness in the empirical evidence favoring effects from labor market reforms, and others who argue that a combination of beneficial international events and monetary policy mistakes have played an important part in the UK’s recent economic improvement.

TI  - Monetary policy and wage bargaining in the EMU: Restrictive ECB policies, high unemployment, nominal wage restraint and rising inflation
AU  - Hein, Eckhard
AB  - Assessing the effects of monetary policy and wage bargaining on employment and inflation in the European Monetary Union (EMU), in the first step a Post-Keynesian competitive claims model of inflation with endogenous money is developed. In this model the NAIRU is considered to be a short-run limit to employment enforced by independent and conservative central banks. In the long run, however, the NAIRU will follow actual unemployment and is therefore also dependent on the forces determining aggregate demand, including monetary policies. But the NAIRU may also be reduced by effectively co-ordinated wage bargaining as has been shown by institutional political economists. Applying these considerations to the economic performance of the EMU, different scenarios determined by wage bargaining coordination and the European Central Bank.s (ECB) monetary policies are developed. It is shown that the first phase of EMU was dominated by uncoordinated wage bargaining across EMU and an .anti-growth-bias. of the ECB. Therefore, the Euro area was plagued with nominal wage restraint, high unemployment and rising inflation. Economic performance will improve if the ECB abandons its asymmetric monetary strategy. This may be facilitated by a higher degree of effective wage bargaining co-ordination across EMU.

TI  - Secular Stagnation, Unemployment Hysteresis and Monetary Policy in EMU: Scratches but Not Scars?
AU  - Belke, Ansgar
T2  - The Economists’ Voice
AB  - The strength of mutually reinforcing links between the demand and supply sides of the macroeconomy is an important issue for policymakers which has emerged from the financial crisis. The prevailing view that only cyclical policies influence the demand side, and structural policies affect the supply side has been challenged in two dimensions. Firstly, long periods of weak demand have the potential to lead to rising structural unemployment and a permanently lower capital stock – inducing hysteresis effects. Secondly, if one believes in the relevance of hysteresis in the form propagated by [Blanchard, Olivier J., and Lawrence H. Summers. 1986. “Hysteresis and the European Unemployment Problem.” In NBER Macroeconomics Annual , edited by Fischer, S., Vol. 1, 15–78. Cambridge: MIT Press], stronger demand fueled, for instance, by monetary policy may, as a corollary, be able to reverse such effects. This paper argues that the Blanchard and Summers type of hysteresis should, however, not be taken literally and not taken as the basis of one-to-one into recommendations for monetary policy and/or the monetary policy strategy. We show that bluntly pointing to the hard form of “reverse hysteresis” and implementing bold counter-cyclical monetary (and fiscal) policies to cope with hysteretic unemployment is neither necessary nor sufficient. Instead, we argue that it is necessary to refer to subtler forms of hysteresis, which are more compatible with the data. These subtler forms still leave some room for monetary policy to maneuver, but in a much more complex way. If long-term unemployment is stagnating even during an upturn, they may even serve as a basis to recommend a contractionary monetary policy stance. At the same time, however, inequality which is causing persistent or even permanent demand deficiencies becomes relevant as hurdle for lower unemployment in the hysteresis context. Seen on the whole, thus, a second wave of hysteresis-based research on monetary policy options following the first wave in the 1980s should clearly be on the agenda.

AB  - This paper analyzes equilibrium, dynamics, and optimal decisions on the factor bias of innovation in a model of induced innovation. In a model with full employment, we show that (a) if the elasticity of substitution is always less than or greater than unity, there is a unique steady state equilibrium; (b) if the elasticity of substitution is less than unity, the steady state is stable, but convergence is oscillatory; (c) if the elasticity of substitution is greater than unity, the steady state is a saddle point; and (d) if the elasticity of substitution is less than unity for both high and low effective capital labor ratios but greater than unity for intermediate values, then there can be multiple steady states. In a model where efficiency wages lead to equilibrium unemployment, we show that if the elasticity of substitution is less than unity, there will be a bias towards excessive labor augmenting innovation, resulting in too high unemployment, with convergence to the unique steady state being oscillatory, rather than monotonic. Similarly, if the elasticity of substitution between skilled and unskilled labor is less than unity, and there is efficiency wage unemployment for unskilled labor only, there is will be excessively skill-biased innovation. This paper provides an alternative resolution to the Harrod-Domar conundrum of the disparity between the natural and warranted rate of growth to that of Solow, with strong policy implications, for instance, concerning the effects of income distribution and monetary policy both in the short run and the long.

T2  - European Journal of Political Economy
AB  - This paper offers a reappraisal of the inflation–unemployment tradeoff, based on frictional growth, describing the interplay between nominal frictions and money growth. When the money supply grows in the presence of price inertia (due to staggered wage contracts with time discounting), the price adjustments to each successive change in the money supply are never able to work themselves out fully. In this context, temporary nominal rigidities let monetary policy have permanent real effects. Although our theory contains no money illusion, no permanent nominal rigidities, and no departure from rational expectations, there is a long-run inflation–unemployment tradeoff. Our empirical analysis suggests that this Phillips curve may be reasonably flat. We show that the persistence of inflation and unemployment, in response to monetary policy shocks, is related to the slope of the long-run Phillips curve.

AB  - Spanish unemploymentSamuel Bentolila and Olivier J. BlanchardSpain has experienced very high inflation in the 1970s and extremely high unemployment in the 1980s; the latter still stands at 16.6% today, with inflation rising again. In this paper we argue that Spain has suffered from the same problems as most European countries, but in a stronger form. The specificity comes from the Franco legacy, which left Spain in the mid-1970s with both an archaic system of labour relations and an inadequate production structure. We find the cause of the inflation explosion in a wage push, itself originated in a breakdown of labour relations; and trace the initial rise in unemployment to the non-accommodating stance of monetary policy.Turning to the large magnitude of the increase in unemployment and its steadily decreasing effects on inflation, we argue that three mechanisms were at work: a decrease in capital accumulation caused by the wage explosion and monetary contraction; labour shedding on a large scale; and ‘hysteresis’ effects, whereby high unemployment led to changes in the labour market, resulting in higher equilibrium unemployment.We infer that there is an important bootstraps component to Spanish unemployment. Thus, much lower unemployment is feasible, and achievable at steady speed with little inflation cost; policies aimed at undoing some of the endogenous changes in the labour market would make it easier and faster.

TI  - Monetary Policy and the Wage Inflation-Unemployment Tradeoff
AU  - Gabriel, Ricardo Duque
AB  - Using newly assembled data for 18 advanced economies between 1870 and 2020, I study how monetary policy affects wage inflation and unemployment and document two key findings regarding their tradeoff. First, the wage Phillips curve displays a time-varying slope. Second, the tradeoff becomes weaker in low price inflation environments due to a more pronounced unemployment response to monetary policy. These findings lend support to the idea that monetary policy has state-dependent effects with the central banks' ability in exploring the tradeoff being impaired by a low price inflation environment.

AU  - Arestis, Philip
T2  - Review of Keynesian Economics
AB  - This paper examines recent theoretical and empirical developments on fiscal policy to conclude that it is an effective macroeconomic tool in terms of curing unemployment. It is further shown that financial stability, ignored prior to the ‘Great Recession’, is important in economic policy. Fiscal policy can contribute to curing unemployment, especially so when coordinated closely not only with monetary policy but also with financial stability policies. It is also suggested that such coordination should be geared towards reducing income inequality. It is then high time that economists and economic policy-makers turned their attention more closely and seriously to restoring faith in fiscal policy with its strong macroeconomic role as a means of curing unemployment. Fiscal policy, properly coordinated with monetary and financial stability policies, should thereby be restored to its proper upgraded role in terms of economic policy.

AB  - When the economy is in a liquidity trap and households have a precautionary motive to save against unemployment risk, adverse demand shocks cause severe deflationary spirals and output contractions. In this context, we study the implications of optimal monetary policy, which consists of keeping the nominal rate at zero longer than implied by current macroeconomic conditions. Under such policy and incomplete markets, expected improvements in labour market conditions mitigate the rise in unemployment risk and decline in demand. As a result, market incompleteness does not significantly amplify contractions in output and inflation at the zero lower bound. However, when the central bank follows realistic policy rules, rather than the optimal policy, incomplete markets worsen the fall in demand and unemployment insurance becomes more important for output stabilisation.

AB  - This paper analyses the factors which influenced the Bank of England’s liquidity ratio from 1 January 1876 to the end of 1913. The liquidity ratio is defined as the ratio of gold and silver holdings to banknotes issued by the Bank of England and it is also called the “Proportion”. A key aspect of the gold standard, as this period is called, was the legal obligation on the part of Central Banks to convert, on request, banknotes into gold.1 From this obligation resulted the “discipline” imposed on governments and Central Banks at the time. The minimum gold cover of notes outstanding was established by law and varied from country to country. As Central Banks could not let the gold cover of notes issued fall below the legally established minimum, it is clear that the ratio of gold to notes was constantly monitored, leading to apprehension when it was falling rapidly and/or approaching the legal minimum and to a relaxed attitude when it was increasing.

AB  - With this Festschrift, we would like to honour Andrew Hughes Hallett on the occasion of his 60th birthday. Andrew’s achievements in economics are outstanding and we will return to that again later. Moreover, he has been and still is an excellent supervisor for PhD students, whose work covers a broad range of economics. It is therefore difficult to categorize Andrew in terms of one particular field of economics. Maybe the common ground of anyone who has ever worked with Andrew is that theories always have to be tested empirically. This is why one of the areas this book emphasizes is hypothesis testing. As with Andrew’s work itself, this book covers a wide variety of topics.

AB  - When individuals are risk adverse, they dislike volatility in consumption. In an environment where economic fluctuations are driven by exogenous real shocks, governments try to prevent these exogenous real shocks from inducing consumption volatility. Taking the process that determines these exogenous fluctuations as given, there are two methods through which the government can intervene and prevent excessive consumption volatility. They can use the various tools of government, like monetary policy or government consumption, to smooth aggregate demand and aggregate output in the face of these exogenous shocks. Similarly they can allow fluctuations in output, but use fiscal policy through direct taxes and transfers to smooth any consumption fluctuations. It should be clear from the title that this paper will focus on the latter method. In a currency union like the euro zone, individual national governments ceded their national monetary policies to the European Central Bank. Thus individual governments in the euro zone no longer have monetary policy as a tool to prevent country-specific real shocks from driving fluctuations in country-specific output. As will be clear in a later section, this paper will not model the role of government consumption in smoothing output fluctuations (see Fatás and Mihov 1999, for a discussion on the output stabilizing role of government spending). Instead this paper will focus on the role of a government tax and transfer scheme in smoothing consumption fluctuations given fluctuations in output.

AB  - This paper develops an endogenous coalition formation framework suitable for studying a design of international macroeconomic policy coordination between an arbitrary number of countries and monetary authorities in the presence of (possibly multiple) monetary unions. In analyzing the feasibility of policy cooperation, we follow the approach proposed by the recent literature on the non-cooperative theory of coalition formation, which includes Bloch (1995, 1996), Yi (1997), Ray and Vohra (1997, 1999), Finus (2001) and Finus and Rundshagen (2001, 2003). These models share the common framework of a two-stage structure. In the first stage, coalitions are formed. In the second stage of the game (the stabilization phase), assuming all coalition structures as given, the model is solved by methods of linear quadratic differential games.

AB  - The primary objective of this paper is the empirical evaluation of the theoretical postulate by Sapir and Sekkat (1999) that the adoption of a single election day throughout the Economic and Monetary Union (EMU) of the European Union (EU) might be welfare improving. They find that the desirability of an electoral area (a common or synchronized election day) between two countries is enhanced when the spillovers between these countries are large and positive, and when they face symmetric shocks. With its asymmetric architecture of economic policy making, EMU is forced by EU law (EC treaty) to coordinate economic (primarily fiscal) policy between its politically independent member states in order not to foil the centralized monetary policy of the ECB. Economic policy coordination is exercised in EMU by a whole range of coordination processes and instruments, of which the Stability and Growth Pact (SGP) is the most prominent one in the field of fiscal policy. As a consequence of economic policy coordination we are already on the right track towards a “European business cycle”. However, as economic policy making (with the exception of monetary policy) is still a competence of the EMU member states, further areas of coordination are welcome. One area where EMU’s member states are still exerting uncoordinated influence (and hence, different shocks) on the economy is the different election dates.

T3  - Advances in Computational Economics
AB  - One of the most pervasive trends in modern macroeconomics is the use of microeconomic theory to derive the behavioural equations of a macroeconomic model. This is frequently accomplished by the invocation of a single “representative agent”, whose own optimising decisions are then scaled up to represent the aggregate behaviour of all consumers in the economy. On the positive side, these strong assumptions permit the marriage of micro and macroeconomic analysis, with the behaviour of the economy at aggregate level directly explicable in terms of individual optimising behaviour. In addition, the preferences of the representative agent are often used to rank different policy outcomes. In the words of Woodford (2001):“An important advantage of using a model founded on private-sector optimisation to analyze the consequences of alternative policy rules is that there is a natural welfare criterion in the context of such a model, provided by the preferences of private agents that are displayed in the structural relations that determine the effects of alternative policies.” This usage of microfounded models to provide a welfare-metric evaluation marks an important new step in quantitative economic policy. Previously, the task of economic theory was typically confined to the positive role of quantifying the likely effects of various policies. The normative task of ranking policy outcomes, or of specifying the “optimal policy”, was left to the policymaker, who would simply choose according to his own volition from the menu of possible outcomes given by the positive economic analysis.

AB  - It has been eight years since the Economic and Monetary Union (EMU) displaced the European Monetary System (EMS), with the euro becoming the legal successor to the European Currency Unit (ECU). Studies on macroeconomic, international economic and microeconomic issues surrounding this important international monetary development have flourished in the economics and finance literature. There is, however, one question that has received no attention: Has the move to EMU changed the behaviour of exchange rate correlations between the euro (ECU) and other currencies? This question has to do with the debates on the success and prospects of the euro, and so deserves exploration in this short paper. Specifically, our study is motivated by the following considerations.

With the formation of the European Economic and Monetary Union (EMU) and the introduction of the euro as its single currency in 1999, the discussion of optimum currency areas and the idea of a single monetary authority governing the monetary policy for all members of the currency union shifted from being a theoretical question to being a practical concern that had immediate policy implications.

AB  - Discussions about future prospects for the US dollar generally focus on whether the present level of the current account deficit is sustainable.1 If the answer is no, the subsequent question is what depreciation is required to produce a sustainable deficit (see Obstfeld and Rogoff 2004, for example). This short paper addresses both issues, but also explores two additional points. First, we examine whether a significant reduction in the value of the dollar will occur even if large deficits continue, because more net exports are required to service a growing debt burden. Second, we suggest that any depreciation in the dollar is likely to be variable across different currencies, with a relatively modest depreciation against the Euro and Sterling. The paper quantifies both effects using the FABEER model.2

AB  - A number of developing countries and emerging markets have now adopted inflation targeting as a framework for monetary policy. Yet some of these countries have high structural unemployment rates. One question that has not been addressed in the monetary policy literature is the implications of inflation-targeting in the context where the unemployment rate is in the double-digit range1. The consensus view in macroeconomics within which many inflation-targeting central banks operate, summarized by Taylor (1997) and emphasized by Svensson (2003), says monetary policy cannot have long-run effects on the growth rate of output and the rate of employment. In this view, the growth rate of output in the long run is determined by the growth rate of labor productivity and the labor force. The seminal models, such as the ones in Svensson (1997, 1999), Ball (1999) and Clarida et al. (1999) among others, fall within this view.

AB  - An important issue in relation to fiscal policy is to strike a balance between “stabilisation” and “sustainability”. The aim of this paper is to discuss what we consider to be the consensus view on fiscal policy design which seems to have emerged in recent years. This view has two pillars. First, automatic stabilisers should be allowed to work since they are rule based, whereas discretionary policies should only be allowed in exceptional cases. The motivation for this “escape clause only” is that if a more flexible use of discretion is allowed for in the conduct of fiscal policy, it could easily lead to a deficit bias. Second, the structural balance should, “on average” over the business cycle, be in balance or surplus. For example, the Stability and Growth Pact stresses the need to ensure “a medium-term budgetary position of close to balance or in surplus”, and in Sweden the fiscal policy framework has been formulated with a requirement of ensuring a given budget surplus (currently 2 % of GDP) on average over the business cycle. Ideally, this type of policy design would guarantee not only that fiscal policy can be used for stabilisation purposes but also that fiscal sustainability problems can be avoided.

AB  - In this paper we analyze the monetary transmission mechanism. In general, the monetary transmission mechanism describes how policy-induced changes in the nominal money stock or the short-term nominal interest rate impact on real variables such as aggregate output and employment. Specific channels of monetary transmission operate through the effects that monetary policy has on interest rates, exchange rates, equity and real estate prices, bank lending and firm balance sheets (Ireland 2005). Recent research on the transmission mechanism seeks to understand how these channels work in the context of dynamic, stochastic, general equilibrium models (e.g. Barran et al. 1995; Boivin and Giannoni 2006; Fukuda 1993; Golinelli and Rovelli 2005; Goodhart and Hofmann 2005; Kim 2003; Lütkepohl and Wolters 2003).

AB  - The adoption of a single currency in Europe has introduced an asymmetry in the level of monetary and fiscal governance. The monetary instrument is given to a central supra-national authority with a view to safeguarding areawide price stability, whereas the fiscal instrument is still within the hands of individual governments. Decisions on the management of the monetary instrument are thus taken at the EMU (European Economic and Monetary Union) level, whereas the use of the fiscal instrument is decided separately at the level of the nation states. The merits of this institutional arrangement in terms of helping achieve price stability have been rigorously analysed in the literature and agreed upon among EMU policy makers. What is less obvious, and perhaps more uncertain in the future however (especially in view of further enlargement), is the role that the fiscal instrument will acquire in this asymmetric set-up. The argument put forward in the literature is that in the absence of a national monetary instrument, governments are more likely to resort to a greater than otherwise use of their fiscal instrument. What will that mean for macroeconomic stability in general and for prices more specifically? It is often quoted that excessive use of the fiscal instrument can jeopardise price stability. And the question that arises as a result is whether European countries are more likely to use their fiscal instrument now than in the past, and if they are, whether this will make the European Central Bank’s objective of price stability more difficult to attain.

AB  - It is four decades since Phelps (1967) and Friedman (1968) unveiled the natural rate of unemployment hypothesis, and the concept of an equilibrium rate of unemployment is central to the prevailing theories of labour market behaviour and the relationship between unemployment and inflation. Moreover, the natural rate and associated unemployment gaps are seen as important reference points, typically as part of a broad range of indicators, by policy makers who need to assess short-term inflation developments and/or consider appropriate decompositions of fiscal balances into their structural and cyclical components. Yet, as surveys and symposia have illustrated (Bean 1994, Cross 1995, Journal of Economic Perspectives 1997), there remains much uncertainty both about which factors do and do not determine equilibrium rates of unemployment, and about the corresponding numerical values.

AB  - Problems of macroeconomic stabilization policies have been analyzed by means of optimal control theory since the early seventies [see, for example, Kendrick (1981)]. However, with the emergence of the New Classical Macroeconomics, this theoretical framework has been increasingly questioned. In particular, Kydland’s and Prescott’s (1977) claim that government’s stabilization policies derived by optimum control methods might be time-inconsistent when private-sector agents have rational expectations of policy-makers’ behaviour has been regarded as a serious argument against the use of optimum control theory in macroeconomics, although the real-world importance of time-inconsistent behaviour is still controversial. [For an early theoretical critique, see Hughes Hallett (1986a); for empirical analyses, Ireland (1999), Boschen and Weise (2004), among others.] Later research on time-inconsistency indicates that dynamic game theory is a more appropriate tool for analyzing stabilization policy problems because more than one decision-maker has to be considered explicitly. Therefore over the last three decades, a large number of studies of macroeconomic stabilization policies (as well as of other areas in economics) have made use of the concepts and results of the theory of dynamic games.

AB  - The subject of our next article, "The Taylor Curve and the Unemployment-Inflation Tradeoff," by Satyajit Chatterjee, is finding an optimal monetary policy menu. In the past, monetary policy options were described in terms of a tradeoff between the unemployment rate and the inflation rate, the so-called Phillips curve. Macroeconomists no longer view the Phillips curve as a viable “policy menu” because its use as such is inconsistent with mainstream macroeconomic theory. In the late 1970s, John Taylor suggested an alternative set of options for policymakers to consider, one that is consistent with macroeconomic theory. These alternative options involve a tradeoff between the variability of output and the variability of inflation

TI  - Identifying monetary policy rules in South Africa with inflation expectations and unemployment
AU  - Bold, Shannon
AU  - Harris, Laurence
AB  - This paper investigates whether a Taylor rule accurately describes the South African Reserve Bank's reaction function in setting interest rates using quarterly data, covering the period since inflation targeting was formally adopted in 2000. The classic Taylor rule is modified to determine whether the South African Reserve Bank takes into account inflation expectations and labour market conditions. Our findings indicate that a modified Taylor rule does describe the South African Reserve Bank's policy rate adjustments. Our estimates of the modified rule yield two significant findings: the South African Reserve Bank's policy rate decisions respond to expected inflation (rather than current inflation), and its relationship to real economy fluctuations is evident in measures of labour market conditions rather than output gap variables. We conclude that under inflation targeting, South Africa's monetary policy has had a forward-looking inflation target that is pursued flexibly in the light of labour market conditions.

AB  - We investigate both theoretically and empirically how unemployment level and its growth affect future stock returns. We find that both a higher unemployment rate and higher growth of unemployment positively predict future stock market returns. In our model, the effects come through their negative effect on equity market participation. Importantly, the two effects reinforce each other making stock returns exceptionally high in periods of high unemployment and high unemployment growth. Our findings are robust to alternative specifications, including using lagged unemployment data or unemployment forecasts. We document and examine theoretically why the same measures related to unemployment predict also the FED’s monetary policy. Controlling for FED’s future policies does not take away the return predictability.

AB  - In Sub-Sahara Africa, few studies have been conducted on how unemployment affects monetary policy in each country. Even an aggregate study of the phenomenon in Sub-Sahara Africa is near absent despite a high level of unemployment in the region. To investigate the empirical link between unemployment and monetary policy, the study employs a sample of 37 countries in Sub-Sahara Africa for the period 2011–2017. Data were obtained from the World Bank and International Monetary Fund database. Using the difference Generalized Method of Moments model, the study determines how monetary policy (using the lending rate as proxy) responds to unemployment, employer's condition and total labour force in Sub-Sahara Africa. We found that monetary policy indirectly responds to employer's condition, but the positive effect of the total labour force on monetary policy is relatively higher than total unemployment as a percentage of the labour force in the region. The study concludes that a linkage exists between monetary policy and employment indicators in Sub-Sahara Africa and therefore, made some policy recommendations.

AB  - The dynamic general equilibrium model with hiring costs presented in this paper delivers involuntary unemployment in the steady state and involuntary fluctuations in unemployment. After calibrating the model, through simulations we are able to show that our model with labour market imperfections outperforms the standard NK model as for the persistence of responses to monetary shocks. Besides, the model can be easily used to assess the impact of different market imperfections on both the steady state and the dynamics of the economy. We are also able to show how two economies, differing in their "degrees of imperfection", react to policy or non policy shocks: a rigid economy turns out to be less volatile than a flexible economy. Something that reflects the actual experience of the US (flexible) and European (rigid) economies

TI  - Hysteresis in Unemployment: Old and New Evidence
AU  - Ball, Laurence M.
AB  - This paper argues that hysteresis helps explain the long-run behavior of unemployment. The natural rate of unemployment is influenced by the path of actual unemployment, and hence by shifts in aggregate demand. I review past evidence for hysteresis effects and present new evidence for 20 developed countries. A central finding is that large increases in the natural rate are associated with disinflations, and large decreases with run-ups in inflation. These facts are consistent with hysteresis theories and inconsistent with theories in which the natural rate is independent of aggregate demand.

We compare different countries, finding that unemployment is influenced by the size of the rural population and that the effects of government regulations are generally weak. We also examine large, persistent increases in unemployment over time, finding that they are caused by contractions in aggregate demand. These demand contractions result from either disinflationary monetary policy or the defense of an exchange-rate peg in the face of capital flight. Our evidence supports hysteresis theories in which short-run changes in unemployment influence the natural rate.

AB  - When labor is indivisible, there exist efficient outcomes with some agents randomly unemployed, as in Rogerson (1988). We integrate this idea into the modern theory of monetary exchange, where some trade occurs in centralized markets and some in decentralized markets, as in Lagos and Wright (2005). This delivers a general equilibrium model of unemployment and money, with explicit microeconomic foundations. We show that the implied relation between inflation and unemployment can be positive or negative, depending on simple preference conditions. Our Phillips curve provides a long-run, exploitable, trade-off for monetary policy; it turns out, however, that the optimal policy is the Friedman rule.

Thus the issue of how to improve upon the time-consistent suboptimal monetary policy is related to that of the coordination of monetary and fiscal policy. We present a model with three players (the central bark, the fiscal authority, and wage setters) in which distortionary taxes are explicitly modelled. We show that binding commitments to monetary rules are not necessarily welfare improving if monetary and fiscal policy are not coordinated. We also examine the effects of different degrees of independence of the central bank.

T2  - International Journal of Emerging Sciences
AB  - Global economic reformation has caused various direct and indirect effects on Malaysia's economic and the most attracting effects can be described throughout the Malaysia's labor market is the unemployment scenario. In Malaysia, most of manufacturing sector has applied high-tech machinery in order to produce more products in a short period; and not depending on labor productivity. These causes job turnover in most of major economic sectors in Malaysia and become worse once the real exchange rate become unstable after Asian financial crises in 1997. The main purpose of this study is to analyze the shocks and integration between financial development stability and overall unemployment in Malaysia for entire period of 1980-2010 by applying unit root test (Augmented Dickey-Fuller, Phillip-Perron and Zivot-Andrew), Gregory-Hansen cointegration test, vector error-correction model (VECM); and causality test. The estimated results clearly show that there is a shocks effect in the middle of 1990s; and long-run cointegration effects appeared between Malaysia's monetary policy and unemployment scenario for Malaysia. This happens because of the 'turn-over effect' appeared in Malaysia's labor market, where the high-educated job seekers are competing with low-educated with experience labor force. Besides that, the numbers of labor used in the agriculture and manufacturing sectors in Malaysia also decline because of technological used in the production line and overflow of foreign labor. Although the findings of this study clearly shows a dynamic long-run connection with 21% of speed of adjustment between Malaysia's monetary policy and unemployment; but surprisingly the causality results does not indicates any causal relation between both variables. In conclusion, we clarify that the monetary policy is not connected with overall unemployment in Malaysia.

AB  - This paper makes two straightforward points that we argue are central to understanding the literature and debate surrounding the stability of the Phillips curve. First, the endogeneity of monetary policy implies that aggregate data are largely uninformative as to the existence of a stable relationship between unemployment and future inﬂation. Second, if the NAIRU model is assumed to be true, regional data can be used to identify the structural relationship between unemployment and future inﬂation. We ﬁnd that a 1 percentage point increase in the unemployment rate is associated with a roughly 0.3 percentage point decline in inﬂation over the next year.

TI  - Natural Unemployment, the Role of Monetary Policy and Wage Bargaining A Theoretical Perspective
AU  - Collignon, Professor S
AB  - The natural rate hypothesis has derived the natural rate of unemployment from the partial equilibrium in labour market to which capital markets adjust. This paper argues that if firms’ mark ups are determined by capital markets, and this affects investment, equilibrium unemployment is a general equilibrium to which the labour market adjusts. As a consequence monetary policy can have real effects. The Central bank’s reaction function is determined by the wage bargaining regime.

TI  - Monetary Policy, In‡ation and Unemployment
AU  - Groshenny, Nicolas
AB  - To what extent did deviations from the Taylor rule between 2002 and 2006 help to promote price stability and maximum sustainable employment? To address that question, this paper estimates a New Keynesian model with unemployment and performs a counterfactual experiment where monetary policy strictly follows a Taylor rule over the period 2002:Q1 - 2006:Q4. The paper …nds that such a policy would have generated a sizeable increase in unemployment and resulted in an undesirably low rate of in‡ation. Around mid-2004, when the counterfactual deviates the most from the actual series, the model indicates that the probability of an unemployment rate greater than 8 percent would have been as high as 80 percent, while the probability of an in‡ation rate above 1 percent would have been close to zero.

TI  - Macroeconomic policy in recessions and unemployment hysteresis
AU  - Sturn, Simon
T2  - Applied Economics Letters
AB  - I adopt Ball’s (1999) cross-sectional approach to test for unemployment hysteresis to panel data. Long-run unemployment is explained with standard institutional controls, and proxies for monetary and fiscal policy reactions in recessions. The sample consists of 20 OECD countries for the period 1985 to 2008. The results indicate that fiscal consolidation in recessions has long-lasting effects on unemployment. No significant impact of monetary policy is found. However, tentative evidence suggests that the effects of fiscal spending are stronger when accommodated by expansionary monetary policy.

TI  - Corporatism and Unemployment in the 1980s and 1990s
AU  - Kenworthy, Lane
T2  - American Sociological Review
AB  - A number of studies have found an association between corporatist institutions and low unemployment in the 1970s and/or 1980s. Three gaps in our understanding of corporatism's labor market effects are addressed here: (1) Which of the two principal forms of corporatism-corporatist wage-setting or union participation in economic policymaking, or both-generates these effects? (2) What are the causal mechanisms? (3) Did these effects continue in the 1990s in the face of globalization, restrictive monetary policy, growing dissension within labor movements, and related developments? The impact of corporatism across 16 affluent OECD countries in the 1980s and 1990s is assessed using pooled time-series cross-section analysis. The results suggest that wage coordination was conducive to low unemployment in the 1980s because it fostered moderation in labor costs, spurred faster economic growth, and encouraged governments to more aggressively pursue policies to reduce unemployment. In the 1990s, this effect disappeared, largely because unemployment outcomes in low wage-coordination countries improved rather than because unemployment outcomes in high wage-coordination countries deteriorated. Union participation in economic policymaking was associated with low unemployment throughout the two decades, conditional on the presence of leftist government. Union participation appears to have had this effect mainly via government policy.

AB  - Este trabajo presenta un modelo de equilibrio general que combina un mercado laboral no Walrasiano con firmas que fijan precio de manera escalonada. El modelo se utiliza para analizar el impacto de distintos choques sobre un conjunto de variables bajo dos reglas de política monetaria alternativas. La principal característica del mercado laboral es la existencia de una fricción en el proceso de búsqueda que resulta en un nivel de desempleo de equilibrio positivo. Por otra parte, la existencia de precios rígidos introduce un mecanismo de transmisión para la política monetaria que opera a través de la demanda agregada. El modelo permite generar una relación positiva entre inflación y empleo (la curva de Phillips) y también permite replicar el patrón observado en la correlación entre la tasa de creación de empleos y la tasa de empleo, y entre la tasa de destrucción de empleos y la tasa de empleo. El modelo también permite replicar la relación negativa que se observa entre creación y destrucción de empleos.

TI  - Effect of Monetary Policy on the Racial Unemployment Rates in the Us
AU  - Bennani, Hamza
AB  - This paper analyzes the effect of monetary policy shock on the unemployment rate of different racial groups in the US using data from 1969Q2 to 2015Q4. Employing a narrative approach to identify monetary policy shocks and local projections, we find that although an accommodative monetary shock affects White workers positively and significantly, the effect on Black workers is larger, and it is not statistically different from zero for Hispanic workers. These results are robust when considering unconventional monetary policy measures in the specification and when exploring the impact of monetary policy on different genders and age groups. We also highlight the role of recession in affecting the transmission channel of monetary policy to the labor market for White and Hispanic workers. Finally, further extensions suggest that the Fed’s monetary policy is effective in reducing the racial unemployment gap, in particular between Whites and Blacks and during economic booms.

T2  - Journal of Economic Dynamics and Control
AB  - We consider an efficiency-wage model with the Calvo-type sticky prices and analyze the optimal monetary policy when the unemployment insurance is not perfect. With imperfect risk sharing, the strict zero-inflation policy is no longer optimal even when the zero-inflation steady-state equilibrium is made (conditionally) efficient. Quantitative results depend on how the idiosyncratic earning loss due to unemployment varies over business cycles. If the idiosyncratic income loss is acyclical, the optimal policy differs very little from the zero-inflation policy. However, if it varies countercyclically, as evidence suggests, the deviation of the optimal policy from the complete price-level stabilization becomes quantitatively significant. Furthermore, the optimal policy in such a case involves stabilization of output to a much larger extent.

TI  - Monetary policy and unemployment rate in Nigeria: An empirical investigation
AU  - Nwamuo, Chukwuemeka
T2  - World Journal of Advanced Research and Reviews
AB  - The study investigated the impact of monetary policy on unemployment rate in Nigeria. Time series data spanning from 1981 to 2020 was sourced from the Central Bank of Nigeria statistical bulletin and national bureau of statistics (various editions). The ARDL bounds testing approach to co-integration was used to analyse the data. Autoregressive Distributed Lag (ARDL) model and Error Correction Model (ECM) were utilized to address the main objectives of the study. The estimated short run coefficient result revealed that prime lending rate has a positive and insignificant impact on unemployment rate while that minimum rediscount rate has a negative and insignificant impact on unemployment rate. The speed of adjustment for correcting disequilibrium from the previous year to equilibrium in current year is 81.9 percent as shown by the coefficient of ECM. The long run result of the study showed that there is a positive and significant impact between prime lending rate and unemployment rate in Nigeria but a negative and significant impact between minimum rediscount rate and unemployment rate in Nigeria. The run result equally revealed that there is a positive and insignificant impact between exchange rate and unemployment rate in Nigeria. Based on these findings, the study recommended that the monetary authority should come up with policies that will reduce minimum rediscount rate as this will encourage borrowing of funds for investment purposes as this will help to reduce unemployment rate. Monetary authorities should also come up with policies that will stabilize exchange rate.

In particular, we focus on the interaction between money growth and nominal frictions. In this context we show that monetary policy has not only persistent, but permanent real effects, giving rise to a long-run inflation-unemployment tradeoff. We evaluate this tradeoff empirically and assess the impact of productivity, money growth, budget deficit, and trade deficit on the US unemployment and inflation trajectories during the nineties.

AB  - This paper addresses the consequences of product and labor market deregulation for monetary policy in a two-country monetary union with endogenous product creation and labor market frictions. We show that when regulation is high in both countries, optimal policy requires significant departures from price stability both in the long run and over the business cycle. The adjustment to market reform requires expansionary policy to reduce transition costs, but deregulation reduces static and dynamic inefficiencies, making price stability more desirable once the transition is complete. International synchronization of reforms can eliminate policy tradeoffs generated by asymmetric deregulation.

T2  - Economies
AB  - This paper attempts to test the pass-through of the real exchange rate (RERT) to unemployment in Brazil over the period 1981M1–2015M11 using linear and nonlinear Autoregressive Distributed Lag (ARDL) models. The result of the linearity test suggests that the relationship between RERT and unemployment is linear in the short-run and nonlinear in the long-run. Therefore, using the symmetric ARDL model for the short-run analysis, we find that an increase in the RERT decreases the unemployment rate. The result of the nonlinear ARDL for the long-run analysis shows that the unemployment rate reacts to the RERT appreciations and depreciations differently with depreciations having a strong effect. However, the pass-through of the RERT to unemployment is incomplete both in the short- and long-run. These findings have important policy implications for the designing of appropriate monetary policy in response to a rise in unemployment resulting from a change in the real exchange rate.

T2  - European Journal of Industrial Relations
AB  - In OECD countries, unemployment disproportionately affects low-skilled workers. This article examines four explanations: wage-setting institutions, employment regulation, globalization and monetary policy. The analysis is based on pooled regressions for 21 affluent countries over the period 1991?2006. We find no support for the argument that low-skilled workers? employment prospects are hindered by legal minimum wages or strict employment protection, nor that wage inequality improves low-skilled employment. By contrast, investment in active labour market policies pays off and low real interest rates are associated with significantly less low-skilled unemployment. Hence, low-skilled workers? job prospects seem enhanced by a combination of active labour market programmes with monetary policy that fully exploits the economy?s growth potential.

We argue that both quantitative easing – and the other non-standard measures introduced by central banks that changed the composition of the asset side of their balance sheets (so-called ‘qualitative easing’) – acted mainly through their effects on interest rates and, in particular, on money market spreads, rather than solely through ‘quantity effects’ in terms of the money supply. We perform a quantitative exercise on the euro area which estimates the effect of the reduction of these spreads to the broader economy.— Michele Lenza, Huw Pill and Lucrezia Reichlin

AU  - Hsing, Yu
T2  - The International Trade Journal
AB  - Extending the original Taylor rule and applying the VAR model, the author finds that the federal funds rate (FFR) responds positively to a shock to the output gap, the inflation gap, the long-term interest rate, or the lagged FFR, and it reacts negatively to a shock to the unemployment rate gap or the exchange rate. The response of FFR to stock prices is insignificant at the 5% level. The long-term rate can explain up to 41.3% or 46.1% of the variation in FFR, depending on the model considered. The exchange rate can explain up to 8.5% or 12.3% of the variance, depending on the model considered. The output gap can explain up to 26.6% of FFR variance. The unemployment rate gap can explain up to 26.8% of the variation in FFR. Because FFR responds to a shock to the output gap and the unemployment rate gap in a similar manner, both may be considered in conducting monetary policy. The more explanatory power of the long-term interest rate than the inflation gap may suggest that both need to be taken into consideration in the Taylor rule.

AB  - We examined the dynamics of inflation and unemployment in Nigeria using the vector error correction methodology over a period of twenty seven years. The study finds evidence of stagflation in the Nigerian economy over the period of study. In fact, the Nigerian economy is managing a shocking rate of inflation together with a severe recession as the unemployment rate has risen astronomically. Consequently, the Nigerian economy is at a cross road. Based on these findings, it is recommended that the CBN maintains a stance of gradual reduction of the benchmark inflation rate to a single digit as the excessive contraction of the monetary policy rate seems to have become counterproductive in recent times. Single digit inflation rate can be achieved if the CBN could increase GDP growth above money supply and increase lending to the real sector of the economy.

TI  - The impact of fiscal and monetary policy on unemployment rate in Nigeria (1981-
AU  - Onwuka, Chinonye Emmanuel
AB  - This study empirically examined the impact of fiscal and monetary policy on unemployment rate using data between the periods 1981 to 2020 by the use of Vector Autoregressive (VAR) model as the major statistical technique of analysis. The data used for the study were annual time series secondary data sourced from Central Bank Statistical Bulletin (CBN) and National Bureau of Statistics (NBS). From the findings, the coefficient of determination (R2) is 0.652 which shows that about 65 percent variations in the unemployment rate were explained by the independent variables. Also, its adjusted counterpart is 0.602 and its shows that about 60 percent growth in unemployment rate can be explained by the independent variables. The unit root test results indicated that all the variables were stationary at first difference and co-integration test confirmed a long run relationship among the variables. The F-stat value of 4.445 confirms that the overall test is significant. The AR root test confirms that the estimated model is stable. Also, the serial correlation LM test and heteroskedacity test confirm that there is no autocorrelation and heteroskedacity in the model.The findings show that government expenditure and interest rate has negative and significant effect on unemployment rate at lag period 2. Government tax was found to be negative and insignificant at lag period 2. Money supply was found to have a positive and significant at lag period 1. By implication, the findings showthat government expenditure, money supply and interest rate are major determinants of unemployment rate in Nigeria since they were found to be statistically significant. Also, the impulse response function of unemployment shows that unemployment rate that has a negative relationship with its past values from periods except in the first, 2nd, 3rd, 4th and 5th periods.Furthermore, from the forecast error variance decomposition (FEVD), it is obvious that the highest innovation was due to government tax and money supply, while the shock of government expenditure and interest rate in Nigeriawere the lowest over the periods. The study concludes that there is need for diverse strategies that will be targeted towards employment creation in Nigeria. Thus, an expansionary fiscal and monetary policy should be encouraged to support employment generation in the country.

TI  - Conventional and unconventional monetary policy vs. households income distribution: An empirical analysis for the Euro Area
AU  - Guerello, Chiara
T2  - Journal of International Money and Finance
AB  - By recovering measures of income dispersion from the European Commission Consumer Survey, this analysis addresses whether conventional and unconventional monetary policies affect income inequalities in the Euro Area and the impact thereof on monetary transmission. First, in a VAR framework, the effects of both types of monetary policy on income distribution are evaluated. Second, the marginal effect of income dispersion on the consumption elasticity to monetary shocks is investigated using the same framework. The results suggest high cross-country heterogeneity in the impact of monetary policy and non-linearities associated with the redistributive strength of fiscal policy and the maturity of the household portfolio. Standard expansionary monetary measures typically have a small contractionary effect on income distribution. Mildly high-income dispersion is beneficial for the transmission of the monetary shocks to consumption because it overcomes the negative effect of consumption smoothing. However, for what concerns Q.E. measures, poorly redistributive fiscal policy and highly sensitive households’ portfolio might trigger these results.

AB  - Rudebusch and Williams (2015) conclude “A wedge in the dual mandate: Monetary policy and long-term unemployment” with the policy prescription “Optimal policy should trade off a transitory period of excessive inflation in order to bring the broader measure of underemployment to normal levels more quickly." The question that I address is whether our knowledge of the dynamics linking monetary policy, inflation and real growth is sufficiently well-developed that policy recommendations of the sort that Rudebusch and Williams proffer can be effective. I present two bodies of empirical evidence pertinent to this issue. The first has to do with the Phillips Curve itself; the second with the class of models now used to analyze the economic effects of monetary policy.

TI  - Amerisclerosis? The Puzzle of Rising U.S. Unemployment Persistence
AU  - Coibion, Olivier

AB  - The persistence of U.S. unemployment has risen with each of the last three recessions, raising the specter that future U.S. recessions might look more like the Eurosclerosis experience of the 1980s than traditional V-shaped recoveries of the past. In this paper, we revisit possible explanations for this rising persistence. First, we argue that financial shocks do not systematically lead to more persistent unemployment than monetary policy shocks, so these cannot explain the rising persistence of unemployment. Second, monetary and fiscal policies can account for only part of the evolving unemployment persistence. Therefore, we turn to a third class of explanations: propagation mechanisms. We focus on factors consistent with four other cyclical patterns which have evolved since the early 1980s: a rising cyclicality in long-term unemployment, lower regional convergence after downturns, rising cyclicality in disability claims, and missing disinflation. These factors include declining labor mobility, changing age structures, and the decline in trust among Americans. To determine how these factors affect unemployment persistence, this paper exploits regional variation in labor market outcomes across Western Europe and North America during 1970-1990, in contrast to most previous work focusing either on cross-country variation or regional variation within countries. The results suggest that only cultural factors can account for the rising persistence of unemployment in the U.S., but the evolution in mobility and demographics over time should have more than offset the effects of culture.

TI  - Welfare costs of inflation in a dynamic economy with search unemployment
AU  - Heer, Burkhard
T2  - Journal of Economic Dynamics and Control
AB  - We present a monetary general equilibrium model with labor market frictions in the form of search unemployment which is calibrated for the US economy. Interestingly, both employment and output may even increase with the rate of inflation depending on the elasticity of labor supply. Considering the transition dynamics following a change in the monetary policy, the optimal quarterly inflation rate is found to amount to approximately −0.6% in the benchmark case. A reduction of the inflation rate from its current level to its optimal value only results in small welfare gains equal to 0.08% of total consumption.

AB  - Can a model with limited labor market insurance explain standard macro and labor market data jointly? We construct a monetary model in which: i) the unemployed are worse off than the employed, i.e. unemployment is involuntary and ii) the labor force participation rate varies with the business cycle. To illustrate key features of our model, we start with the simplest possible framework. We then integrate the model into a medium-sized DSGE model and show that the resulting model does as well as existing models at accounting for the response of standard macroeconomic variables to monetary policy shocks and two technology shocks. In addition, the model does well at accounting for the response of the labor force and unemployment rate to these three shocks.

AU  - Mishkin, Frederic S.
T2  - Journal of Political Economy
AB  - A heated debate has arisen over the policy ineffectiveness proposition associate with the work of Lucas, Sargent, and Wallace. It postulates that anticipated aggregate demand policy will have no effect on business-cycle fluctuations, so that one deterministic, feedback policy rule is as good as any other from the point of view of stabilizing the economy. This paper develops a methodology for empirically analyzing rational-expectations models displaying this neutrality result and then applies it to the important question of whether anticipated monetary policy matters to the business cycle.
