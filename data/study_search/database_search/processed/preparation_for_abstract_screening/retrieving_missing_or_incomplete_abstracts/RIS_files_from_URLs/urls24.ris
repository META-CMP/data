TI  - Hobbes’ redoubt? Toward a geography of monetary policy
AU  - Mann, Geoff
T2  - Progress in Human Geography
AB  - This paper undertakes three tasks: (1) to consider monetary policy?s role in contemporary capitalism and state governance; (2) to introduce the fundamentals of contemporary monetary policy; and (3) to outline some of the material and ideological stakes in the social, political, and economic geographies of monetary policy and central banking as practised in advanced capitalist nation states. I focus on subnational and class effects, arguing that the precarious relation between central banks and national democratic processes has become increasingly tenuous. Empirical examples are drawn from Canada and the USA.

TI  - Unemployment and Vacancies in Britain
AU  - Pissarides, Christopher
T2  - Economic Policy
AB  - UnemploymentChristopher PissaridesThis paper uses data on unemployment flows and job vacancies to shed light on the phenomenal rise of unemployment in Britain, from under 3% in the 1960s to over 15% (male) unemployment in the 1980s. It finds that most of the rise is due to a fall in the demand for labour. A more expansionary fiscal policy and improved international competitiveness would have ameliorated this fall. Some of the fall, however, can also be attributed to supply pressure, which stopped wages from falling fast enough. Social security and a more relaxed attitude by the state in the provision of unemployment and supplementary benefits also contributed to the rise in unemployment, by making workers more choosey.The paper investigates whether it is possible for any given set of underlying factors to give rise to more than one equilibrium unemployment rate. If so, a temporary stimulus might release the economy from a low-level equilibrium. However the conditions necessary for this do not appear to hold in practice. Thus fiscal and monetary policy can permanently affect unemployment only if they can permanently alter aggregate demand.Microeconomic policy, like marginal employment subsidies, can, however, have a permanent effect on unemployment and the paper investigates whether there are any grounds for wishing to use such policy tools to alter the free-market equilibrium unemployment rate. There is evidence that the allocation of workers to jobs is done more efficiently at a fairly high level of overall labour demand. It follows that, unless job vacancies exceed unemployment, job creating policy measures will be beneficial.

TI  - Unemployment Insurance in Macroeconomic Stabilization
AU  - Kekre, Rohan
AB  - I study unemployment insurance (UI) in general equilibrium with incomplete markets, search frictions, and nominal rigidities. An increase in generosity raises the aggregate demand for consumption if the unemployed have a higher marginal propensity to consume (MPC) than the employed or if agents precautionary save in light of future income risk. This raises output and employment unless monetary policy raises the nominal interest rate. In an analysis of the U.S. economy over 2008-2014, UI beneﬁt extensions had a contemporaneous output multiplier around 1. The unemployment rate would have been as much as 0.4pp higher absent these extensions.

AB  - Following the global financial crisis of 2007 and the ensuing global recessionary of 2009, most economies have been concerned with improving economic growth levels as well as lowering levels of unemployment rates. For the case of South Africa, much concern has been placed on the ability of monetary authorities to contribute to such macroeconomics objectives. therefore the primary objective of the study was to investigate the influence of the monetary policy conduct on economic growth and unemployment.

TI  - The Impact of Monetary Policies on Nigeria's Unemployment: Lessons for Poverty Reduction in Nigeria
AU  - Ernest Ibekwe, Ekwe
AB  - The problem of unemployment in Nigeria is gaining popularity on daily basis both in the national and international arena. Lots of research has been done on how to curb this menace, yet it seem like much has not be done. This study on the impact of monetary policies on Nigeria’s unemployment, has investigated the relationship between monetary policy variables (Treasury bill rate, money supply, monetary policy rate, exchange rate) and unemployment using the regression method of analysis. The unit root (Augmented Dickey Fuller) test was used to determine the stationarity of the variables. Drawing from the recent development in co-integration analysis and the error correction model (ECM), the study found as follows: that Treasury bill rate and money supply have positive relationship with unemployment in Nigeria, that there is a negative relationship between monetary policy rate and exchange rate with unemployment in Nigeria. The study concludes that there is a significant negative impact of monetary policies on Nigeria’s unemployment, which if not checked will continue to hinder the success of the fight against poverty in the nation.

AB  - The strongest predictor of changes in the Fed Funds rate in the period 1982–2008 was the layoff rate. That fact is puzzling from the perspective of representative-agent models of the economy, which imply that the welfare gains of stabilizing employment fluctuations are small. This paper augments a standard New Keynesian model with a labor market featuring countercyclical layoffs that lead to large,uninsurable, and permanent idiosyncratic wage declines. In our benchmark calibration, welfare may be increased by 1 percent of lifetime consumption or more when the central bank’s policy rule responds to the layoff rate instead of purely targeting inflation.

AB  - The recent literature on monetary policy has raised many questions about the trade-off between inflation and unemployment and the assumption of a constant NAIRU. This paper tries to investigate the effects of monetary policy on NAIRU in Iran. We implement a structural Vector Auto Regression (VAR) model to measure the effects of monetary policy in shaping NAIRU in Iran’s economy. Our results suggest that monetary policy has negligible effects on NAIRU and the unemployment rate is mainly affected by labor market imperfections, such as wage rigidity, labor law, regulations, and institutions that do not match with today’s world economy.

We examine the dynamic effects of uncertainty shocks on unemployment during recessions in the US. We estimate a Bayesian time-varying parameter structural vector autoregression. We analyze how the impact of uncertainty shocks on U.S. unemployment changes over time. We find that uncertainty shocks have both higher unit impact and higher total effect on unemployment during the Great Recession compared to those of previous recessions. Different characteristics of the Great Recession amplify the effect of uncertainty on unemployment. Two channels distinguish the Great Recession from other recessions: the federal funds rate hitting the zero lower bound and financial frictions. We find that these factors are significant determinants of the time-varying relationship between unemployment and uncertainty. Robustness analyses with alternative measures of uncertainty and alternative empirical specifications validate the results of the paper.

TI  - The Effect of Oil Prices on Unemployment: Evidence from Pakistan
AU  - Ahmad, Fawad
T2  - Business and Economics Research Journal
AB  - A developing country like Pakistan is heavily dependent on the oil as inputs for almost every industrial sector therefore increase in oil prices, increases inputs cost, consequently increasing production costs and unemployment rate. Existing literature has mostly focused on the relationship between unemployment and oil prices of developed countries, the current study used the data from developing country Pakistan to investigate the relationship between oil prices and unemployment. The current study used monthly data from the period 1991:01–2010:12, making 238 observations of each variable for analysis and employed Toda Yamamoto causality test. The results of current study suggested the significant effect of oil prices on unemployment but found no significant association between real interest rate and unemployment, thus findings of current study are partially consistent with the efficiency wage model. Furthermore, results suggest that real oil prices cause significant changes in the real interest rate in Pakistan. It can be concluded from the results that oil prices can be used in long run to improve the forecasting of unemployment and real interest rate.

TI  - The Fed's Conduct of Monetary Policy: Has it Changed and Does it Matter?
AU  - Boivin, Jean
AB  - This paper investigates changes in the conduct of U.S. monetary policy. Monetary policy is modeled in the context of the Bernanke-Mihov (1998) structural VAR (SVAR) extended to allow explicitly for the Fed's forward looking behavior. This is achieved by including its real-time forecasts on inflation and unemployment (the "Greenbook" forecasts). Stability tests that exploit the SVAR identifying restriction indicate significant time variation. Since a central goal is to characterize the economic relevance of the identified changes, the paper shows how the estimation of a flexible time varying parameter model can be implemented in a SVAR using the median-unbiased estimation procedure developed by Stock and Watson (1998). The results suggest an important shift towards a greater response to inflation relative to unemployment, which might have been accompanied by an increase in its targeted level. While the bulk of these changes were brought about under Volcker, they fail to explain the high interest rates and the recession of the early 80's. Together with the results obtained for the period around the 1990 recession, changes in monetary policy, defined in the strict context of the identified policy rule, do not appear to be important in the explanation of business cycle fluctuations.

AB  - In this study, we empirically search the effects of oil price uncertainty and oil price shocks on U.S. unemployment rate using a GARCH-in-mean VAR model for the period 1974:q2–2017:q4. Based on our findings, we show that oil price uncertainty significantly increases unemployment rate in the U.S. economy. Likewise, our impulse-response analysis affirms that a positive oil price shock increases unemployment while the response of unemployment to a negative oil price shock is negative. Moreover, we reveal that unemployment rate reacts to positive and negative shocks asymmetrically. More specifically, the response of unemployment to negative oil price shocks is negative and slighter in size. Besides, oil price uncertainty is found to magnify the rise in the U.S. unemployment rate. These findings are in keeping with the real options theory which reveals that the uncertainty about goods' prices leads firms to postpone or abandon their production and investment and they seem to be robust to the use of different real oil price measures.

TI  - Optimal Monetary Policy in the Presence of Human Capital Depreciation During Unemployment
AU  - Laureys, Lien
AB  - When workers are exposed to human capital depreciation during periods of unemployment, hiring affects the unemployment pool’s composition in terms of skills, and hence the economy’s production potential. Introducing human capital depreciation during unemployment into an otherwise standard New Keynesian model with search frictions in the labour market leads to the finding that the flexible-price allocation is no longer constrained-efficient even when the standard Hosios condition holds. This is because it generates a composition externality in job creation: firms ignore how their hiring decisions affect the extent to which the unemployed workers’ skills erode, and hence the output that can be produced by new matches. Consequently, it might be desirable from a social point of view for monetary policy to deviate from strict inflation targeting. But quantitative analysis shows that although optimal price inflation is no longer zero, strict inflation targeting stays close to the optimal policy.

T2  - European Journal of Political Research
AB  - The principal concerns of this paper are with the roles partisan politics have played in the making of fiscal and monetary policies within OECDcountries as well as the extent to which these policies have complementedeach other. It is argued that parties of the left pursue fiscal policiesthat are distinctly different from those pursued by the right. The criticaldifference is in the way these parties use fiscal policy as a correctivemechanism for dealing with macroeconomic problems: leftist parties adoptcounter-cyclical fiscal policies while right-wing parties adhere topro-cyclical fiscal stances. The paper also examines two argumentsregarding monetary policy and how partisan politics affect this policyarea. The first and most conventional argument sees the formal independenceof the central bank from government as a means of negating partisaninfluences on monetary policy; the second advances the propositionthat, regardless of central bank independence, monetary authoritiesare not politically neutral but instead share views similar to thoseof parties on the right-hand side of the political spectrum. Empiricalanalysis, using a pooled cross-section time-series design with datafrom 14 countries between 1961 and 1994, produces evidence in favorof the argument concerning the role of partisanship in fiscalpolicy; it also shows little support for the view that central bankindependence inhibits partisan influences while at the same timeprovides support for the thesis that central banks are politicallynon-neutral. Thus, coordination between fiscal and monetary policiesis far less likely to occur when left-wing parties are in power.

AB  - We construct a Neo-Keynesian model, with a standard utility specification and nominal rigidities, in which monopolistic firms have employment-related norms and the wage bargaining power is variable. Due to norms, firms hire workers in excess of the number of employees required by technology. Workers in excess are efficiency reserves of the firms. We present the implications for the unemployment-inflation trade-off. We show that, with norms and variable bargaining power, besides the natural rate of unemployment, the unemployment rate at which firms establish/cancel norms, and the one at which the labor bargaining power reach maximum are relevant to decision making We show that, in the presence of norms, the response of the unemployment rate to a change in the monetary policy stance is relatively large, and temporarily concomitant increases in the unemployment rate and inflation can occur.

AU  - Ribba, Antonio
T2  - The World Economy
AB  - The unemployment–inflation trade-off can be interpreted as a proposition concerning the response of these two variables to aggregate demand shocks. In this paper, we study the possible presence of the trade-off in the Euro Area and in a wide group of Euro-area countries in the last 20 years, that is, since the start of EMU. We use the structural VAR methodology that allows the separation between supply and demand shocks. Our main finding is that the existence of a trade-off is largely confirmed both at the Euro Area and at the national level. Nevertheless, the size of the trade-off, measured at different horizons, shows some heterogeneity among countries. No less important, when we augment the VAR model by introducing monetary policy in the context of an open economy, we find that monetary policy shocks push inflation and unemployment in opposite directions in the currency area. Another interesting result concerns the evidence of a relatively flat relation between unemployment and inflation, conditionally to monetary policy shocks. The bulk of these conclusions seem to be confirmed by a number of robustness checks.

AB  - This paper studies the patterns of unemployment dynamics in Germany. To provide a deeper insight into the margins of unemployment adjustment, we employ a structural VAR model and identify the effects of a technology shock as well as two policy shocks. We find that the worker reallocation process varies substantially with the identified shocks. The job finding rate plays a larger role following a technology shock and a monetary policy shock, while the separation rate appears as the dominant margin after a fiscal policy shock. Technology shocks are relatively important for variations in the transition rates, though they do not seem to trigger the high volatilities of German labor market variables. Considering policy shocks, our results point towards fiscal interventions as a promising instrument, but with several limitations.

AU  - Springer, R. A.
AB  - Degree: Ph.D.DegreeYear: 1990Institute: The University of TennesseeCoincident with the development of the Post Keynesian argument that money is not neutral has been an emphasis on the endogeneity of the money supply. The major implication of this reconceptualization of monetary theory is that monetary policy has real effects on output and employment in historical time. Descriptive statistics on economic growth in the Tennessee Valley indicate that employment in the region has suffered disproportionately from the restrictive intentions of monetary policy because of its dependence on the manufacturing sector.

Degree: Ph.D.DegreeYear: 1990Institute: The University of TennesseeCoincident with the development of the Post Keynesian argument that money is not neutral has been an emphasis on the endogeneity of the money supply. The major implication of this reconceptualization of monetary theory is that monetary policy has real effects on output and employment in historical time. Descriptive statistics on economic growth in the Tennessee Valley indicate that employment in the region has suffered disproportionately from the restrictive intentions of monetary policy because of its dependence on the manufacturing sector. An econometric model was developed and applied to various aggregations of national and regional employment data to compare the adverse effects of monetary policy over the period between 1969 and 1987. The hypothesis motivating the study is that the disproportionate effect of monetary policy on the region is actually due to the disproportionate effect on rural areas within the Tennessee Valley, which constitute approximately fifty percent of the region''s population.The results indicate that monetary policy has had a disproportionate effect on employment in the Tennessee Valley, and support the hypothesis that the effect on rural areas within the Valley explains this vulnerability. The central reason offered for this pronounced vulnerability to monetary policy is the region''s growing dependence on manufacturing employment relative to the rest of the United States in the context of a relatively underdeveloped regional service sector.The results have profound implications for the capacity of monetary policy to regulate the national rate of inflation. The study suggests that the inability of the monetary authorities to deliberately localize the adverse of effects of policy in the context of structural change in the economy diminishes the success that can be expected, and that an alternative approach to the problem of inflation be developed which recognizes the critical relationship between nominal wages and productivity.

TI  - Monetary Policy Vis-à-vis Inflation Control, Unemployment and Income Per Capita in West Africa
AU  - Oke, David
AU  - Shobande, Olatunji
AB  - This paper examines whether monetary policy, especially inflation control can reduce unemployment and raise income per capita in West Africa. We used quarterly data covering the fifteen member countries as at February 2017 over the period 1996 to 2014. Given the diagnostic tests, the Panel Vector Error Correction Model was employed for the analysis. The study shows a long-run causality running from monetary policy to both unemployment and per capita income. It also reveals that if the Central Banks (CBs) increase inflation in last quarter, a rise in unemployment will occur but if the CBs choose to increase unemployment, inflation will fall. Main while, unemployment can turn worse if CBs increase lending interest rate in last two quarters. We suggest that CBs in West Africa should rather prefer to keep inflation low through interest and inflation rates targeting.

AB  - We analyze the implications of trend growth for optimal monetary policy in the presence of search and matching unemployment. We show that trend growth interacts importantly with the inefficiencies stemming from the labor market. Higher trend growth exacerbates the inefficiencies of the labor market and therefore calls for larger deviations from price stability. Our analysis implies that lower trend growth reduces not only the level but also the optimal volatility of the nominal interest rate.

TI  - Study of the Unemployment Rate Response to Narrative Monetary Policy Shocks in Canada: A Local Projection Approach with Regional Differences and State-dependency Considered
AU  - Wang, Zhe (Leo)
AB  - This study explores the state-dependent effects of monetary policy shocks on the
Canadian economy at two levels: national and provincial. The study employs the
monetary policy shocks identified by Champagne and Sekkel (2018) by narrative
approach. The impulse response framework used in the study is local projections
(LPs), a widely applied linear regression-based alternative to the standard vector
autogression (VAR) framework. The state-dependecy is modelled by both a dummy
variable approach and a smooth transition approach. Two economic states are considered: expansion and recession. One major finding is noticeable differences exist across some Canadian provinces as well as between economic states in terms of unemployment response to monetary policy. Sensitivity analyses solidify the result.
Key words: impulse response, local projections, state-dependent, monetary policy
shocks, unemployment rate, territorial, provincial, long horizon

AB  - We review a growing literature that incorporates endogenous risk premiums and risk taking in the conduct of monetary policy. Accommodative policy can create an inter-temporal tradeoff between improving current financial conditions at a cost of increasing future financial vulnerabilities. In the U.S., structural and cyclical macroprudential tools to reduce vulnerabilities at banks are being implemented, but may not be sufficient because activities can migrate and there are limited tools for nonbank intermediaries or for borrowers. While monetary policy itself can influence vulnerabilities, its efficacy as a tool will depend on the costs of tighter policy on activity and inflation. We highlight how adding a risk-taking channel to traditional transmission channels could significantly alter a cost-benefit calculation for using monetary policy, and that considering risks to financial stability as downside risks to employment - is consistent with the dual mandate.

AU  - Kuttner, Kenneth N.
T2  - Journal of Economic Perspectives
AB  - In November 2008, the Federal Reserve faced a deteriorating economy and a financial crisis. The federal funds rate had already been reduced to virtually zero. Thus, the Federal Reserve turned to unconventional monetary policies. Through "quantitative easing," the Fed announced plans to buy mortgage-backed securities and debt issued by government-sponsored enterprises. 
Subsequent purchases would eventually lead to a five-fold expansion in the Fed's balance sheet, from $900 billion to $4.5 trillion, and leave the Fed holding over 20 percent of all mortgage-backed securities and marketable Treasury debt. In addition, Fed policy statements in December 2008 began to include explicit references to the likely path of the federal funds interest rate, a 
policy that came to be known as "forward guidance." The Fed ceased its direct asset purchases in late 2014. Starting in October 2017, it has allowed the balance sheet to shrink gradually as 
existing assets mature. From December 2015 through June 2018, the Fed has raised the federal funds interest rate seven times. Thus, the time is ripe to step back and ask whether the Fed's 
unconventional policies had the intended expansionary effects—and by extension, whether the Fed should use them in the future.

AB  - Cet article se penche sur les différentes raisons qui explique l'apparition durant les années 1980 d'un écart entre le chômage canadien et américain. Nous y développons un petit modèle d'équilibre du marché du travail canadien pour quantifier et évaluer ces raisons. Nous concluons que l'écart est, pour la plus grande part, dû à l'accroissement de la générosité de l'assurance-chômage en 1971, dont l'effet a souvent été masqué par des booms de ressources naturelles. L'important accroissement du chômage en 1981-1982 semble résulter d'une politique monétaire très restrictive, dont l'impact a été accentué par une chute du prix des exportations. /// The paper reviews different reasons for the emergence in the 1980s of an unemployment gap between Canada and the US. We develop a small equlibirium model of the Canadian labour market to quantify and evaluate these reasons. We conclude that the gap is essentially due to the liberalization of the benefits system in 1971, the effects of which have often been masked by raw-material booms. The huge increase in unemployment in 1981-82 appears to have been due to a sharp monetary squeeze, exacerbated by a fall in the price of exports.

T2  - Journal of International Money and Finance
AB  - This paper examines whether government ideology has influenced monetary policy in OECD countries. We use quarterly data in the 1980.1–2005.4 period and exclude EMU countries. Our Taylor-rule specification focuses on the interactions of a new time-variant index of central bank independence with government ideology. The results show that leftist governments have somewhat lower short-term nominal interest rates than rightwing governments when central bank independence is low. In contrast, short-term nominal interest rates are higher under leftist governments when central bank independence is high. The effect is more pronounced when exchange rates are flexible. Our findings are compatible with the view that leftist governments, in an attempt to deflect blame of their traditional constituencies, have pushed market-oriented policies by delegating monetary policy to conservative central bankers.

TI  - Economic Growth and Unemployment Under Alternative Monetary Policy Regimes: Evidence from South Africa - ProQuest
AB  - Monetary policy is not only the process by which the monetary authority of a country controls
the supply of money, but is furthermore a sufficient tool to overcome the problem of economic
growth and unemployment. This can take place when the policy instruments – interest rates
(Repo) and money supply growth (M3) – have significant effects on these macroeconomic
variables. However, the issue of the efficacy of monetary policy on GDP growth and
employment creation is at the centre of debates among researchers. Some researchers are of
the opinion that the objective of monetary policy in achieving and maintaining price stability is
founded on the idea that inflation is not good for economic growth, employment creation and
income equality but, instead, only secures macroeconomic environment.
 In South Africa, the efficiency of different monetary policy tools, inflation and money-supply
targeting, on economic performance has been questioned. Moreover, the issue of the high level
of unemployment remains controversial among scholars. Therefore, the structural vector-error
correction model (VECM) methods was used with quarterly data in order to investigate the
impact of aggregate money supply (M3), interest rate (Repo) and real exchange rate on CPIX
(inflation) , economic growth (GDP volume rate) and unemployment (joblessness rate) in South
Africa for the period 1986 to 2010. The results show that both monetary-policy regimes have
positively impacted on economic growth, but the impact of the pre-inflation-targeting regime is
higher. Moreover, a weak positive liaison between monetary policy and unemployment is
observed, but the post-inflation-targeting regime shows a higher percentage decrease in
unemployment than the pre-inflation targeting period. Beyond any doubt, the research
approves the engagement of the SARB to monitor (target) CPIX (inflation) due to its ability to
ensure price stability and create a stable economic environment favourable to economic
performance.

TI  - The Effects of Monetary Policy Shocks on Inflation, Unemployment and Output | RDP 2020-01: Credit Spreads, Monetary Policy and the Price Puzzle
AU  - Beckers, Benjamin
T2  - Research Discussion Papers
AB  - The results from the previous sections suggest that RR shocks used by BT are invalid instruments for truly exogenous monetary shocks for two reasons. First, they violate the exogeneity condition as they capture the Bank's endogenous response to credit market spreads motivated by the predictive information for inflation in those spreads. Second, they are anticipated by financial market participants and hence give rise to the issue of non-fundamentalness in SVAR models.

I will explore the relevance of these two issues in turn. In the first step, I will assess the effects of monetary policy when estimated using the residuals from the Taylor-type policy rule augmented by credit spreads (regression BT-CS of Table 1) as my monetary policy shock series. These ‘first-stage’ residuals are independent of the Bank's response to financial market conditions but are still anticipated to some extent as shown in Section 3.2 (Table 3; Figure 5). In the second step, I will then remove this anticipatory component from these ‘first-stage’ residuals by purging them of the expected cash rate change by financial market participants (Table 3).

At each step, I will estimate the effects of monetary policy on the variables of interest in a simple SVAR with four lags similar to RR, Coibion (2012) and BT. Accordingly, the VAR includes (log) underlying CPI, (log) real GDP, the unemployment rate and a measure of the policy shock, in that order. Here, the policy shock replaces the cash rate typically included to measure the stance of monetary policy. Since the cash rate is typically included in levels, I cumulate the quarterly shock series over time. The ordering imposes the typical recursive identifying assumption that changes in the policy rate do not affect any macroeconomic variables within the same quarter.

Microfit version 4.0 and Eviews version 6.0 were used for model estimation. Model estimation results showed the significant and negative effect of inflation and unemployment on economic growth in long term, which indicated that inflation and unemployment decreased economic growth in long term. This issue revealed that authorities should diligently endeavor and plan to reduce and control inflation and unemployment. The results of this study can be used by all respected authorities in Iran, especially authorities of economic and social institutions, so that they could attempt to reduce and control unemployment and inflation in order to achieve economic growth

I find that, with complete exchange rate pass-through, the optimal policy rule features unemployment targeting as well as inflation targeting. However, the welfare gain from responding to unemployment fluctuations diminishes as the rate of exchange rate pass-through to import prices decreases. With low exchange rate pass-through, the optimal monetary policy is strict inflation targeting.

AB  - There are now a number of papers which derive optimal monetary policy rules in the context of structural macroeconomic models.1 One common feature of these works is that the resulting reduced form coefficients in the policy rule are composed of two sets of structural parameters, some pertaining to the monetary authority’s loss function and others describing the behavior of the private sector. While these papers derive normative prescriptions about the monetary authority behavior, very few estimates of the deep parameters in the monetary authority’s loss function are available in the literature. The present chapter provides such estimates.

AB  - The aim of this paper is to investigate the effects on the rate of unemployment of the disinflationary policies and other aggregate demand shocks which affected the Italian economy during the period 1979–1995. To this end, a structural cointegrated VAR model is built and the structural disturbances are recovered by imposing a set of short-run, contemporary restrictions. The results show that both short-run and long-run movements in unemployment are influenced by disturbances to aggregate demand, as well as by supply shocks. This evidence seems to be at odds with the predictions of “natural-rate” theories.

This methodology allows the researcher to analyze if monetary policy changes have different effects on the various stages of business cycles. The major purpose of this paper, therefore, is to analyze the existence of asymmetric monetary policy shocks on real economic activity. Specifically, it examines if the effects of monetary policy are different at various stages of the business cycle. It also provides effects of monetary policy on credit, liquidity and output growth. A combination of Dynamic Schocastic General Equilibrium Model (DSGE) and General Equilibrium Model techniques will be applied in the study.

AB  - This paper examines the empirical relationship between oil prices and several key macroeconomic variables. In particular, we investigate the cyclical comovements of crude oil prices with output, consumer prices, unemployment, and stock prices. The methodology involves the use of the Hodrick–Prescott [Hodrick, R.J., Prescott, E.C., 1980. Post-War US Business Cycles: An Empirical Investigation. Working Paper, Carnegie Mellon University] and Baxter–King [Baxter, M., King, R.G., 1999. Measuring business cycles: approximate band-pass filters for economic time series. Review of Economics and Statistics 81, 575–593] filters, as well as the recently developed full-sample asymmetric Christiano–Fitzgerald [Christiano, L.J., Fitzgerald, T.J., 2003. The band pass filter. International Economic Review 44, 435–465] band-pass filter. Contemporaneous and cross-correlation estimates are made using the stationary cyclical components of the time series to make inference about the degree to which oil prices move with the cycle. Besides documenting a number of important cyclical relationships using three different time series filtering methods, the results suggest that crude oil prices are procyclical and lag industrial production. Additionally, we find that oil prices lead consumer prices.

AU  - Labonte, Marc
AB  - The Federal Reserve (the Fed) defines monetary policy as its actions to influence the availability and cost of money and credit. Because the expectations of market participants play an important role in determining prices and economic growth, monetary policy can also be defined to include the directives, policies, statements, and actions of the Fed that influence future perceptions.

AB  - We analyze the implications of changes in the trend growth rate for optimal monetary policy in the presence of search and matching unemployment. We show that trend growth in itself does not generate a trade-off for the monetary authority, but that it interacts importantly with the inefficiencies stemming from the labor market. Higher trend growth exacerbates the inefficiencies of the labor market and therefore calls for larger deviations from price stability.

AB  - The strength of the Federal Reserve's commitment to low inflation is truly a milestone in the history of U.S. monetary policy. Using advances in monetary economics, the Fed has been able to identify policy mistakes that led to high and volatile inflation in the past. Learning from experience, the Fed has transformed its understanding into operational principles to ensure that such mistakes do not happen again. The Fed has successfully applied these principles in the pursuit of low inflation for some time now.

TI  - Fiscal Policy in an Unemployment Crisis
AU  - Rendahl, Pontus
T2  - The Review of Economic Studies
AB  - This article shows that equilibrium unemployment dynamics can significantly increase the efficacy of fiscal policy. In response to a shock that brings the economy into a liquidity trap, an expansion in government spending increases output and causes a fall in the unemployment rate. Since movements in unemployment are persistent, the effects of current spending prevail into the future, leading to an enduring rise in income. As an enduring rise in income boosts private demand, an increase in government spending sets in motion a virtuous employment-spending spiral with large effects on macroeconomic aggregates.

TI  - Essays on housing, unemployment and monetary policy
AU  - Ume, Ejindu
AB  - In this dissertation, I study the interconnections between the housing market and labor market, and the link between monetary policy and housing market activity. In the first chapter, I focus on the interplay between the housing and labor market. To do so, I construct a model of search and bargaining across two different markets: the labor market and the housing market. The model highlights that housing prices and frictions in the housing market have a profound impact on labor market activity through the desire of workers to eventually purchase a home, the "American Dream." The model also reveals that labor market frictions can impact housing market activity. I also perform a calibration exercise to evaluate economic activity in general equilibrium. I find that frictions in the housing market generate strong negative external effects on the labor market. More specifically, a tighter housing market is associated with higher unemployment rates and less job creation. Consequently, my findings suggest that policymakers should be very careful in implementing policies targeted towards housing -- housing markets are likely to generate significant external effects to other sectors of the economy, especially the labor market. To study the effects of monetary policy on housing market activity I develop an overlapping generations model in which housing is traded across generations of individuals. Incomplete information leads to a transactions role for money so that monetary policy can be effectively studied. Moreover, individuals face liquidity risk which interferes with their ability to accumulate housing wealth. Contrary to the existing literature, I demonstrate that it is important to disaggregate fixed investment between the residential and non-residential sectors. In particular, I find the effects of monetary policy are asymmetric across the components of the overall capital stock. I conclude this chapter with a policy experiment studying how optimal monetary policy depends on housing market fundamentals. In response to adverse supply conditions in the housing sector, monetary policy should be more aggressive in order to promote residential investment and the housing stock. However, monetary policy should be conservative in order to limit exposure to risk if fundamentals favor housing demand. The third chapter is an empirical look at the relationship between monetary policy and housing market activity. I analyze and quantify the effects of monetary policy on residential investment, housing starts, new private housing permits and new single family houses sold. To conduct the analysis I estimate a vector autoregression model (VAR) where the monetary policy shock is identified using sign restrictions. No restrictions are imposed on the variables of interest, however, in response to a monetary policy shock I impose sign restrictions on the impulse responses of price, output, reserves and the federal funds rate. I find that a contractionary monetary policy shock reduces housing market activity for up to a year after the shock. Interestingly, 2 to 3 years after the economy contracts, activity in the housing sector reverses course. The findings suggest that once the economy contracts the Federal Reserve Bank reverses course by lowering the federal funds rate, and this policy reversal stimulates housing market activity.

TI  - Monetary and fiscal policy effects on unemployment and inflation in Uganda
AU  - Sebuliba, Nantumbwe Aminah
AB  - Over the recent past, Uganda has experienced disproportionate volatility in inflation alongside rapid growth of unemployment. Whilst inflation has been curtailed to single digit figures since the economic crisis of the 1970s, nevertheless, in the recent past, inflation volatility and unemployment have constrained Uganda’s growth outlook. Like many various developing countries, Uganda has interacted monetary and fiscal policy frameworks as macroeconomic tools to spur productive growth. Most developing countries like Uganda continue to grapple with the challenges of jobless growth which is largely attributed to unstable inflationary pressures as well as low investment which further eggravated rapid expansion in unemployment levels. Government policy efforts have recently been greatly inhibited by rising youth unemployment rates in the country, this has greatly affected Uganda’s growth dynamics. Whilst developed countries have successfully used monetary and fiscal policy frameworks in their pursuit to macroeconomic stability, due to their complex structural economic dynamics, low income countries face challenges in implementing both monetary and fiscal policy to stabilize their economies. Central banks across all countries strive for low and predictable inflation as key in fostering economic growth. The debate over the applicability between monetary and fiscal policy frameworks in the pursuit of enhanced growth continues among policy analysts. The general observation especially in low income countries pertains to the use and effective coordination of monetary and fiscal policy in efforts to stabilize these economies. Despite numerous public expenditure reforms implemented and decline in poverty levels in Uganda, unemployment continued to rise over the past decade consequently inhibiting the country’s growth prospects which has ultimately undermined the econoimy’s capacity to external shocks. Keynes and the monetarists ignited the contentious debate over the superiority between monetary and fiscal policy frameworks which has transformed macroeconomic policy application. A conducive private sector environment as well as large expansions of infrastructure are key fundamental aspects of the development strategy in developing countries, they enhance growth in per capita income. Whilst the monetary authority emphasizes price stability when formulating policies, the fiscal authority pursues its objectives accommodative of the underlying circumstances in the economy. This study aimed to establish an econometric model to predict the impact of monetary and fiscal policy on unemployment and inflation in Uganda using annual time series data for the period 1980 to 2013. The study sought to investigate the influence of monetary and fiscal policy variables on the Ugandan economy in relation to unemployment and inflation. The analysis in the study is based on a twofold oriented objective. The first objective was to investigate monetary and fiscal policy dynamics in Uganda in relation to unemployment. The second objective examined the conduct of monetary and fiscal policy framework on inflation in Uganda. The study analysis begins with a review of literature on the various monetarists and Keynesian theories in relation to the underlying monetary and fiscal policy frameworks. Considering the analysis was a twofold objective, two empirical models linked to unemployment and inflation as well as their relative determinants are specified. The Empirical literature review examined in the study is based on various monetary and fiscal policy theories as well as empirical works by Keynesians, classical economists and the Friedman views. The time series data used were obtained from published sources of the World Bank and IMF, the Uganda Bureau of Statistics (UBOS), Ministry of Finance, Planning and Economic Development (MoFPED) statistical reports and annual statistical drafts from the Uganda Revenue Authority (URA) and Bank of Uganda (BOU). To empirically investigate the influence of monetary and fiscal policy variables on unemployment and inflation in Uganda, considering the use of two dependent variables i. e unemployment and inflation, hence, two estimation techniques were applied in the study namely; the Modified Ordinary Least Squares that comprise of FMOLS and DOLS and the Autoregressive Distributed Lag (ARDL) approach. The estimation analysis in the study contains two main parts which are spread over two chapters. The first part of the analysis deals with the effects of fiscal and monetary policy on unemployment. The estimation techniques applied in the study included the Fully Modified Ordinary Least Squares (FMOLS) and Dynamic Ordinary Least Squares (DOLS) applied to a Vector Autoregressive (VAR) model. The analysis regressed monetary and fiscal policy aggregates on unemployment in a twofold objective. The first sub section regressed fiscal policy aggregates on unemployment using; total government expenditure, total government revenue, tax revenue and trade openness on unemployment using both FMOLS and DOLS techniques. The second sub-section regressed monetary policy on unemployment using; interest rates, money supply, real effective exchange rates and inflation being regressed against unemployment. To test for presence of unit root among the variables of the sample period of 1980 to 2013, the study employed three approaches; i.e. the Augmented Dickey Fuller (ADF) test, Phillips-Perron (PP) test and Kwiatkowski–Phillips–Schmidt–Shin (KPSS) test. Included in this analysis is the test for structural breaks to further determine stationarity in the data series. The results revealed the presence of structural breaks. Structural breaks tend to inhibit stationarity among the variables at levels. However, when presence of structural breaks is taken into consideration, it simplifies empirical estimation analysis under review. The Johansen Cointegration approach was further applied to establish existence of a stable long-run relationship between monetary policy and fiscal policy as well as their respective variables included in the model in relation to unemployment, this further entailed estimation of FMOLS and DOLS in the model estimation analysis. The results from the above analysys show a negative and statistically significant relationship between total government expenditure (LGOVTEXP) and unemployment (LUNEMPLOYMENT). However, tax revenue, trade openness as well structural reforms which denotes the (SB) coefficient all show a positive and significant relationship with unemployment. Additionally, total government revenue (LGOVTREV) shows a negative relationship with unemployment although statistically insignificant. The DOLS results in this analysis all show statistically insignificant results between all the variables and unemployment. The second subsection using DOLS, analysed the impact of monetary policy on unemployment, revealed a negative and significant relation between interest rates, real exchange rates and structural reforms (SB) with unemployment. Money supply indicates a negative but statistically insignificant relationship with unemployment. However, inflation has a positive and statistically significant relationship with unemployment. The normality tests conducted indicate normal distribution of the residuals. Similiraly, the AR inverse roots show stability of the models estimated whilst the multi-collinearity and Wald tests all showed unbiased estimation results. Having analysed the effects of fiscal and monetary policy on unemployment the interest was to further test the impact of fiscal and monetary policy on inflation. This part constitutes two sub-sections. The ARDL approach ws used to analyse the influence of fiscal policy on inflation. The results reveal a negative and statistically significant relationship between inflation (DLINF) and total government expenditure (DLGOVTEXP) both lagged twice. Similiraly, total government revenue (DLGOVTREV) and tax revenue (DLTAXREV) both lagged once indicate a negative and statistically significant relationship with inflation. However, unemployment lagged three times indicates a negative and statistically insignificant relationship with inflation whilst trade openness lagged three times has a positive and satatistically significant relationship with inflation. The Granger causality test results revealed among all the fiscal policy aggregates used, only inflation Granger causes total government revenue. The second part on the effects of fiscal and monetary policy on inflation used monetary variables; interest rates (DLINT), money supply (DLMS) and real exchange rates (DLREER). The ARDL results revealed all coefficients to have positive signs. Inflation and real exchange rates lagged five and four times respectively have a positive and significant relationship with the dependent variable of inflation. However, interest rate and money supply lagged five and three times respectively show a positive and statistically insignificant relationship with inflation. The estimated model showed no evidence of presence of serial correlation through numerous diagnostic tests performed. These include; heteroscedasticity, residual normality and misspecification tests as well as the Cusum stability tests. Under the analysis of monetary policy dynamics on inflation, the Granger causality test revealed that inflation Granger causes interest rates. Similiraly, real exchange rate Granger causes inflation. The ARDL results in this sub-section suggest that inflation regressed against its own lagged values is statistically significant in explaining variations on inflation. Further, interest rates, money supply and real exchange rates significantly explain variations in inflation during the period under review. The results from the above analysis suggest that firstly, the fiscal authority in Uganda should formulate dynamic as well as robust fiscal reforms that can effeficiently be coordinated with sound monetary policy reforms. This ought to stimulate meaningful economic growth in the economy which would further enhance employment growth. Secondly, policy authorities should implement macroeconomic policies which harmonise public spending whilst at the same keep inflation subdued. In this regard, inflation targeting policies should be strengthened. Thirdly, the macroeconomic policy framework in Uganda should be coordinated with strong employment targeting policies in an effort to broaden labour market dynamics.

TI  - Volatility, Stabilization and Union Wage-setting: The Effects of Monetary Policy on the ‘Natural’ Unemployment Rate
AU  - Bonatti, Luigi
T2  - Economic Notes
AB  - In a unionized economy with nominal-wage contracts, the ‘natural’ (rational-expectations equilibrium) employment level is not invariant with respect to the stabilization rule followed by the monetary authority. This is because alternative monetary policies change the variance of the inflation rate (price level) relatively to the variance of some measure of economic activity (employment level), thereby influencing the trade-off desired by union members between the real wage and the probability of employment. Indeed, a more volatile employment level induces the (risk-neutral) union members to prefer a higher expected real wage. (J.E.L: E5, J5).

AU  - Iversen, Torben
T2  - International Organization
AB  - The effects of financial capital mobility on monetary policy autonomy are relatively well understood, but the importance of particular monetary regimes in distinct national-institutional settings is not. This article is a theoretical and empirical exploration of the effects of monetary policy regimes on unemployment in different national wage-bargaining settings. Based on a rational expectations, two-stage game of the interaction between the wage behavior of labor unions and the monetary policies of governments, I argue that monetary policies have real (employment) effects in all but the most decentralized bargaining systems. Specifically, in intermediately centralized bargaining systems a credible government commitment to a nonaccommodating monetary policy rule will deter militant wage behavior with salutary effects on unemployment. In highly centralized systems, by contrast, restrictive monetary policies will clash with unions' pursuit of wage-distributive goals and produce inferior employment performance. Only in highly fragmented bargaining systems is money “neutral” in the sense that employment performance is unaffected by monetary regimes. The model has clear consequences for the optimal design of central banks and collective bargaining arrangements and suggests new ways to study institutional change (hereunder the causal effect of increasingly globalized capital markets). The argument is supported by pooled time-series data for fifteen OECD countries over a twenty-one-year period.

AB  - This study investigates the response of unemployment to selective macroeconomics shocks for the period of 2000:Q1-2010:Q1. It finds that positive shocks to growth, growth in export and inflation reduce unemployment. On the other hand, shocks to exchange rate, interbank interest rate and money supply increase unemployment. The results are consistent with Phillips curve and Okun’s Law suggestion. Namely, negative relationship between output and unemployment and positive relationship between unemployment and inflation are found. Also, this study finds consistent results with earlier literature.

AB  - This paper examines the effects of unconventional monetary policy by the Federal Reserve, Bank of England, European Central Bank and Bank of Japan on bond yields, stock prices and exchange rates. We use common methodologies for the four central banks, with daily and intradaily asset price data. We emphasize the use of intradaily data to identify the causal effect of monetary policy surprises. We find that these policies are effective in easing financial conditions when policy rates are stuck at the zero lower bound, apparently largely by reducing term premia.

AB  - As an extension to the literature on the risk-taking channel of monetary policy, this paper studies the existence of a systemic risk-taking channel (SRTC) in the Eurozone, through an original macroeconomic perspective based on causality measures. Because the SRTC is effective after an “incubation period”, we make a distinction between short and long-term causality, following the methodology proposed by Dufour and Taamouti (2010). We find that causality from monetary policy to systemic risk, while not significant in the very short term, robustly represents 75 to 100% of the total dependence between the two variables in the long run. Reverse causality is rejected: systemic risk did not influence the policy of the European Central Bank before the global financial crisis. However, central banks must be aware that a too loose monetary policy stance may be conducive to a build-up of systemic risk.

AB  - The aim of this study is to explore the relationship between inflation and unemployment in Ghana. The study also aims to test for the existent of the Philips curve in Ghana using the new Keynesian Philips curve model on annual time series data sampled from 1970 to 2013. The sample period was divided into two subsamples -from 1970 to 1982 and 1983 to 2013- in order to test for the effect of the Economic Recovery Programme on the relationship between inflation and unemployment. The empirical estimate reveals that, changes in unemployment does not brings about changes in inflation both subsample periods. Again, the study rejects evidence of the Philips curve in Ghana. This is attributed to the fast growing labour force that lack the appropriate skills to earn them a job placement, alarming rate of rural-urban migration, imperfect market information which has resulted in mismatch of that makes inflation unresponsive to changes in unemployment. Monetary policies to influence inflation would not bring about any trade-off between inflation and unemployment. To reduce the ever increasing unemployment in Ghana, policy direction should focus on creating job opportunities for both uneducated and educated individuals.Keywords: Inflation, Unemployment, Philips curve, Ghana

AB  - Effect of credit on economic growth, unemployment and poverty provides evidence from Indonesia on the role of banks credit for promoting economic growth and reducing both unemployment and poverty.  To document the link between banks credit and economic growth, we estimate a VAR model and variance decompositions of annual GDP per capita growth rates to examine what proxy measures of banks credit are most important in accounting for economic growth over time and how much they contribute to explaining economic growth.  We also estimate an ECM to document the relationship between banks credit to both unemployment and poverty. This paper revealed bi-direction causality between banks credit and economic growth.  Banks credit promotes economic growth and economic growth affects credit depth and financial development.  Furthermore, banks credit is a growth accelerating factor on Indonesian economic growth.  Banks credit is an endogenous growth and a good predictor on Indonesian economy.Our estimation model explained that credit allocated by banks increases business escalation to the real sectors then promotes economic growth, decreases unemployment rate through increasing in labor demanded, increases income and then decrease poverty.  This overall transmission mechanism just occurred through presence of banks credit by increasing money supply to the real sectors, promotes growth and social welfare. Keywords :  banks credit, economic growth, growth accelerating factor, poverty, unemployment JEL Classification : E51, E52, E58

AU  - Bermeo, Nancy

AB  - The movement for European integration has yielded a European Union of fifteen states with a unified monetary system that will eventually embrace over 370 million people. If current trends continue, an average of one in ten of these people will be unemployed. This book is about unemployment and European unification. It examines the consequences of each and their interconnections. It presents general essays on Europe as a whole, on labor unions and on a variety of case studies including Spain, Portugal and the Netherlands. Its central argument is that the European economy should be reformed but that it should retain many of its managed aspects and be wary of modeling itself on the United States. The book contributes to the literature on European politics, political economy, and comparative public policy.

TI  - Monetary Policy and Unemployment in Open Economies (Draft)
AU  - Engler, Philipp
AB  - In the welfare analysis of monetary policy shocks in open economies in the tradition of the redux model of Obstfeld and Rogo¤, unemployment plays no role. An expansionary shock simply leads to an increase in hours worked reducing welfare because disutility of labour increases while the increase in consumption increases welfare. In one such model with complete pass-through from exchange rates to prices this results in a short-run negative welfare e¤ect and a long-run positive welfare e¤ect (Engler and Tervala, 2011). In the present paper I allow for an explicit role of unemployment in the same vein as in Galí’s (2010) closed economy model. Variations in total hours are due to changes in employment and unemployment rather than changes in hours per worker and an expansionary monetary policy reduces unemployment. If, in contrast to previous studies, I allow for factors like …scal costs of unemployment or a preference for high levels of employment, the result of Engler and Tervala (2011) can be modi…ed considerably in that welfare can increase even in the short-run.

AB  - In a WS-PS model with large price and wage setters and free entry of firms in the goods market, the economy may exhibit multiple unemployment equilibria. We show that the effects of monetary policy on unemployment depend on the equilibrium at which the economy is located. In particular, we show that an anti-inflation policy reduces unemployment in the low unemployment equilibrium, but that such a policy leads to a rise in unemployment when the economy is already stuck in the high unemployment equilibrium.

AB  - This study examined the impact of monetary policy on unemployment in Pakistan. The time-series data for 1977 to 2019 was taken and the ARDL technique is used for estimation. Unemployment was used as a dependent variable along with other control variables while the money supply was the core independent variable of the research. It was concluded that money related arrangement not just contributes to observing past patterns and additionally future projections of superficial factors of real factors also. The outcomes show that there is a critical and negative connection between spending Deficit and unemployment. The gross domestic product development rate is decidedly identified with unemployment. Populace development rate is adversely identified with unemployment. The consumer price index is contrarily identified with unemployment.

AB  - This paper studies the impact on the change in fed funds rate held by U.S FOMC. In analyzing the interest rate policy’s impact on the output indicator and unemployment, I studied stylized facts from both long-run and short-run analyses. The significant impact on the monetary policy in changing output growth and the unemployment rate is found in the crouching vector error correction model, which considers the asymmetric shape of long-run equilibrium. In the short-run analysis, I also found significant evidence that the unexpected change in the fed funds rate has the significant impact on unemployment. To measure the pure surprising factor of the change in fed funds rate, I extract the surprising factor after eliminating the fed funds futures rate from the total change in the fed funds rate. The interest rate policy’s significance is shown in the crouching ordinary least squares model, consisting of decomposed surprises, percentage change in price levels, and unemployment in two directions, increase and decrease. The short-run results show that when a monetary authority surprises a market by increasing the fed funds rate higher than expected (a contractional policy), the unemployment rate increases.

TI  - Monetary Policy Transmission Mechanism and Dynamics of Unemployment in Nigeria
AU  - Ozigbu, Johnbosco Chukwuma
AB  - As a key component of macroeconomic policy design, monetary policy has remained a strategic tool employed by the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) to control unemployment and achieve price stability. This paper examines the link between the transmission mechanism of monetary policy and unemployment rate in Nigeria. Specifically, the research efforts focused on examining how monetary policy transmission channels – money supply, real interest rate, private sector credits and cash reserve ratio affect unemployment. The Stock-Watson dynamic least squares method and Granger causality test were utilized in analyzing the time series data sourced from the CBN Statistical Bulletin and National Bureau of Statistics. The PhillipsPerron unit root test results reveal that all the variables are integrated of order one. It was found from the cointegrating regression result that broad money supply is positively linked to unemployment rate. On the contrary, private sector credit as a ratio of GDP has significant negative effect on unemployment rate. This finding is very welcoming as it explains the effectiveness of monetary policy transmission mechanism in reducing unemployment rate in Nigeria. However, it was found that real interest rate and cash reserve ratio are statistically insignificant in influencing unemployment in Nigeria. The Granger causality test results reveal that unidirectional causality flows from broad money supply and private sector credits to unemployment. This is indicative that broad money supply and private sector credits have predictive powers for unemployment in Nigeria. Given the findings, it is recommended for the monetary policy committee and other stakeholders in the Nigerian financial system to prioritise increase in private sector funding and monetary aggregates in order to enhance the effectiveness of monetary policy in reducing unemployment.

AB  - The relationship between monetary policy and unemployment is a frequently-discussed
topic. This debate uses a number of unemployment concepts that are considered relevant
for monetary policy. However, it is not always easy to understand exactly what is meant
by these concepts, or what relationship they have to monetary policy. This article
therefore discusses which concepts are relevant on the basis of modern theory and how
they differ from older academic literature. Based on the main theories on unemployment
the article first discusses concepts dealing with long-run unemployment. After that we
focus on short-run concepts and here particularly the relationship between short-run
variations in unemployment and inflation. An important cause of confusion in the debate,
apart from unclear concepts, is that the new and older reasoning regarding the relationship
between unemployment and inflation in the short run are not compatible with one
another. For example, it is shown in this article that what drives inflation in one reasoning
does not do so in the other

TI  - Should We Reject the Natural Rate Hypothesis?

T2  - Journal of Economic Perspectives
AB  - Fifty years ago, Milton Friedman articulated the natural rate hypothesis. It was composed of two sub-hypotheses: First, the natural rate of unemployment is independent of 
monetary policy. Second, there is no long-run trade-off between the deviation of unemployment from the natural rate and inflation. Both propositions have been challenged. 
The paper reviews the arguments and the macro and micro evidence against each. It concludes that, in each case, the evidence is suggestive, but not conclusive. Policymakers 
should keep the natural rate hypothesis as their null hypothesis, but keep an open mind and put some weight on the alternatives.

TI  - The costs of a purely monetary disinflation policy : the case of long-run involuntary unemployment
AU  - Wagner, Helmut
AB  - There is a common understanding in economics today that
there are only transitory effects of monetary policy on employment. Here I develop the theoretical rationale for the possibility of an economy's getting stuck in long-run involuntary
unemployment as a consequence of a purely monetary disinflation
policy. Involuntary unemployment persists despite flexible
wages and prices and despite rational behavior of economic subjects. The underlying mechanism consists first of a governmental
insurance policy against re-igniting inflation expectations and
second of an information dilemma, or prisoner's dilemma, in which
the entrepreneurs are caught. A falling interest rate—caused by
an ending of the disinflation policy—is, per se, not a sufficient
incentive to expand production for an individual entrepreneur.
There is no functional element such as "the economy" reacting in
a homogeneous way. It is rational for the single entrepreneurs
to wait for the others to invest first. In this case, only
demand policy can get the economy out of unemployment.

TI  - Unemployment Compensation, Monetary Policy, and Suicide
AU  - Hanaoka, Chie
AU  - Gunji, Hiroshi
AB  - [Objective]The purpose of this empirical paper is to explore how differences in fiscal and monetary policies affect health, particularly suicide. To date, studies using US data indicate the significant effects of unemployment on health, while at least some research using non-US data suggests little or no effect (e.g., Browning et al. (2006) and Bockerman et al. (2007) with Danish and Finnish data, respectively). One possible source of these varying impacts may lie in differences in fiscal and monetary policies across countries leading to variation in the level of social protection and the value of the nominal stock of debt. Although most extant studies predominantly focus on the association between unemployment and health, a few studies have investigated the association between fiscal and monetary policies and health.  [Data and Method]The data used are from all OECD countries from 1980 to 2005. Models of the natural log of the suicide rate per 100,000 persons are estimated using population-weighted least squares by gender and age. The key independent variables are two fiscal policy variables (real expenditure on unemployment compensation policy and health policy per capita) and one monetary policy variable (the money market rate). The regression also includes the unemployment rate and real GDP per capita and its rate of growth. The model controls for unobserved country fixed-effects, time-specific effects and country-specific time trends.  [Results]The major finding is that fiscal and monetary policy has significant effects on the rate of suicide. We find these effects vary according to the types of policies and the different phases of the individual’s lifecycle. Similar patterns exist for men and women. There is a significant protective effect of expenditure on unemployment compensation on suicide, particularly for persons aged from 20 to 44 years, but we find no significant effect for persons older than 45 years. An increase in the money market rate (implying tighter monetary policy) increases the rate of suicide for persons less than 54 years of age, but there is no significant effect for those older than 55 years. The other main findings are that macroeconomic conditions (as proxied by the unemployment rate) affect the suicide rate differently depending on the person’s age. For instance, an increase in the unemployment rate increases the rate of suicide for those in their 20s and aged more than 40, but decreases the rate for those in their 30s. Finally, the effects of economic expansion on suicide persist over time, while the effects of the policies examined disappear, mostly within a year.  [Conclusions]From a policy perspective, we need to take into account the effects of public policy on health when analyzing the relationship between unemployment and health.

AB  - We examine whether monetary policy uncertainty influences the reaction of the equity, Treasury security, foreign exchange and crude oil markets, as well as medium-term interest rates, to U.S. macroeconomic announcements. Using intraday futures data, we show that in the presence of higher policy uncertainty the response to macroeconomic news weakens in the stock and crude oil markets and strengthens in the Treasury, interest rate and foreign exchange markets. In times of elevated monetary policy uncertainty, macroeconomic announcements impact the financial and crude oil markets to a large extent through expectations of future monetary policy.

AB  - First, we show that the interest rate on Federal funds is extremely informative about future movements of real macroeconomic variables, more so than monetary aggregates or other interest rates. Next, we argue that the reason for this forecasting is that the funds rate sensitively records shocks to the supply of (not the demand for) bank reserves, i.e. the funds rate is a good indicator of monetary policy actions. Finally, using innovations to the fuels rate as a measure of changes in monetary policy, we present evidence consistent with the view that monetary policy works at least in part through "credit" (that is, bank loans) as well as through "money" (that is, bank deposits) - even though bank loans fail to Granger-cause real variables.

It is still high today, although the average unemployment rate hides a high degree of heterogeneity across countries. The focus of researchers and policy makers was initially on the role of shocks. As unemployment remained high, the focus has progressively shifted to institutions. This paper reviews the interaction of facts and theories, and gives a tentative assessment of what we know and what we still do not know.— Olivier Blanchard

AB  - The prevailing view among economists and policy makers is that money has no impact on production in a longer term characterised by full price and wage flexibility and rational expectations. This book presents a revisionist view of monetary policy and monetary regimes. It presents several new mechanisms, indicating that money affects long-term production. The consequent policy implications are also discussed, including: the uses of monetary policy and monetary regimes in achieving macroeconomic goals; the impact of an independent central bank; the effects of a movement from floating exchange rates to fixed exchange rates in a monetary union. In addition to the theoretical and policy discussions the book also contains a comprehensive survey of the current state of scholarship in this area. Designed as a textbook for advanced undergraduate and graduate students in macroeconomics, labour economics and finance, this book will also appeal to scholars and policy-makers.

T2  - Journal of Post Keynesian Economics
AB  - In light of the growing interest in "new consensus" models, this paper examines Post Keynesian alternatives to the Taylor rule. It identifies two distinctive approaches to Post Keynesian interest rate policy, which we label the activist and the parking-it rules. The first approach advocates the use of nominal (or real) interest rates as a tool of aggregate demand fine-tuning, whereas the second approach moves away from reaction functions, claiming that monetary policy has become too dominant in economic discourse. It proposes, instead, an interest rate policy whereby the central bank "parks" the interest rate (real or nominal) according to a specific rule. Three possible parking rules are examined—the Smithin rule, the Kansas City rule, and the Pasinetti fair rate rule. The paper then explores the macroeconomic consequences of a genuine Post Keynesian alternative to new consensus monetary policy along the lines of the fair rate rule.

The term emerging markets is commonly used to describe business and market activity in industrialising or emerging regions of the world. The term is sometimes loosely used as a replacement for emerging economies, but really signifies a business phenomenon that is not fully described by or constrained to geography or economic strength; such countries are considered to be in a transitional phase between developing and developed status. Examples of emerging markets include China, India, Mexico, Brazil, much of Southeast Asia, countries in Eastern Europe, parts of Africa and Latin America. An emerging market is sometimes defined as "a country where politics matters at least as much as economics to the markets."

T2  - DIW Economic Bulletin
AB  - A European transfer system could contribute to stabilization of the euro area by synchronizing business cycles in the monetary union, thus simplifying the common monetary policy. Such a system is proposed here in the form of a European unemployment insurance scheme. Compared to other forms of fiscal transfer systems, this has some advantages: by putting the focus on short-term unemployment, an automatic link between payments and the cyclical situation of a member state is ensured, making the system relatively robust against political manipulation. Furthermore, this set-up will most likely prevent a case in which countries systematically become net recipients or net contributors. Therefore, the risk of permanently creating transfers to single countries is low. While a European unemployment insurance system would not be suitable for removing or eliminating structural discrepancies between countries (such as those that caused the euro crisis), cyclical imbalances within a monetary union would be effectively dampened, at not much additional administrative cost. Such a system could thus become an important stabilizing element for the member states of the European Monetary Union.

AB  - Launched in Summer 2012, the European Central Bank’s (ECB) Outright Monetary Transactions (OMT) program indirectly recapitalized European banks through its positive impact on periphery sovereign bonds. However, the stability reestablished in the banking sector did not fully translate into economic growth. We document zombie lending by banks that remained weakly capitalized even post-OMT. In turn, firms receiving loans used these funds not to undertake real economic activity, such as employment and investment, but to build cash reserves. Creditworthy firms in industries with a high zombie firm prevalence significantly suffered from this credit misallocation, which further slowed the economic recovery.Received March 21, 2018; editorial decision November 13, 2018 by Editor Philip Strahan. Authors have furnished an Internet Appendix, which is available on the Oxford University Press Web site next to the link to the final published paper online.

AB  - . Recognizing the possible relation between investments, economic growth and unemployment, and how there is not an established impact of an unlikely productive project failure on the secondly mentioned variables, we address such relation and asses theoretically the effect of different instruments of monetary policy on the mentioned macroeconomic indicators. To do this we build upon two models of economic growth considering the role of entrepreneurs, risk takers, and a monetary authority which is the average agent of the economy that is assumed to be aware of how the inflation can damage equally the individuals' life style, independently of their particular levels of income, finding that the impact of the monetary instruments depends on the behavior of the population, and endogenizing the money in circulation.Keywords.

TI  - Labour Markets and Monetary Union: A Strategic Analysis
AU  - Cukierman, Alex
AU  - Lippi, Francesco
T2  - The Economic Journal
AB  - This paper shows that the effects of a monetary union depend on several labour market features. In particular, the switch from national monetary policies to a common monetary policy usually affects both inflation and unemployment, even when all structural parameters of the economy and of unions' and policymakers' preferences remain the same. The benchmark case of a monetary union between identical countries suggests that the switch to a monetary union is likely to make labour unions more aggressive, increasing unemployment. Qualifications to this result are provided under alternative institutional scenarios, like cross-country asymmetries, (pre-union) ERM membership and wage leadership.

TI  - Regional Influences on U.S. Monetary Policy: Some Implications For Europe
AU  - Meade, Ellen E.
AU  - Sheets, Nathan
AB  - This paper looks at the monetary policy decisions of the U.S. Federal Reserve and asks whether those decisions have been influenced solely by national concerns, or whether regional factors have played a role.  All of the Federal Reserve's policymakers have some regional identity, i.e., either their positions explicitly carry some regional affiliation or their region of origin is a factor that must be considered in the selection process.  This research is relevant for the Fed, and it may also be relevant for Europe's fledgling central bank in Frankfurt.  Critics have asserted that ECB policymakers have an incentive to base policy on national developments and respond to national political pressures.  We find that Fed policymakers do take into account developments in regional unemployment when deciding monetary policy, and that these regional developments are more important for central bankers at the hub than in the spokes.  These findings are robust to a variety of different specifications of the voting equation.

AB  - This paper introduces money into the standard labor-matching model. A double-coincidence problem makes money necessary as a medium of exchange. In the long run, a rise in the growth rate of money leads to higher inflation and higher unemployment, such that the long-run Phillips curve is not vertical. The optimal monetary growth rate decreases with greater worker bargaining power, the level of unemployment benefits, and the payroll tax rate.

TI  - Liquidity, Monetary Policy and Unemployment: A New Monetarist Approach
AU  - Xiao, X.
AU  - Dong, M.
AB  - We discover a consumption channel of monetary policy in a model with money and government bonds. When the central bank withdraws government bonds (short-term or long-term) through open market operations, it lowers returns on bonds. The lower return has a direct negative impact on consumption by households that hold bonds, and an indirect negative impact on consumption by households that hold money. As a result, Örms earn less proÖts from production, which leads to higher unemployment. The existence of such a consumption channel can help us understand the e§ects of unconventional monetary policy.

AB  - We construct a utility-based model of ﬂuctuations with nominal 
rigidities and unemployment. We ﬁrst show that under a standard 
utility speciﬁcation, productivity shocks have no effect on unemploy- 
ment in the constrained efﬁcient allocation. That property is also 
shown to hold, despite labor market frictions, in the decentralized 
equilibrium under ﬂexible prices and wages. Inefﬁcient unemploy- 
ment ﬂuctuations arise when we introduce real-wage rigidities. As a 
result, in the presence of staggered price setting by ﬁrms, the central 
bank faces a trade-off between inﬂation and unemployment stabili- 
zation, which depends on labor market characteristics. We draw the 
implications for optimal monetary policy.

TI  - Tradeoff between inflation and unemployment in Turkey
AU  - Karahan, Özcan

AU  - Bölükbaşı, Ömer Faruk
AB  - As a popular subject, over the years the inflation-unemployment tradeoff also known as the Phillips curve attracted the attention of economists and policy makers. Accordingly, our paper aims to investigate the relationship between unemployment and inflation in the Turkish Economy. We employed the Autoregressive Distributed Lag (ARDL) Bounds Testing procedure on monthly inflation and unemployment rate data for the period adopting the Explicit Inflation Targeting Regime from 2006 to 2011 in Turkey. Empirical results reveal that unemployment negatively affects inflation in the short run but there is no causation between them in the long run. These findings provide significant implications for not only the literature focuses on trade-off between inflation and unemployment but also the efficiency of inflation targeting commitment implemented in Turkey.

AB  - We analyse the pass-through of monetary policy measures to lending rates to households and firms in the euro area using novel bank-level datasets. Banks’ characteristics such as the capital ratio, exposure to domestic sovereign debt, percentage of non-performing loans and stability of funding structure are responsible for the heterogeneity in the pass-through of conventional monetary policy changes. The location of a bank is irrelevant. Non-standard measures reduce lending rate heterogeneities. Banks located in financially stressed countries and with weak balance sheets are most affected. Banks’ lending margins have fallen considerably.

AB  - We ask three questions about the connection between monetary policy and inequality. First, does monetary policy aﬀect inequality? While different households respond to changes in monetary policy for diﬀerent reasons, we argue that the overall consumption eﬀects are relatively evenly distributed across households. Second, does household heterogeneity change our understanding of monetary policy transmission? A more careful account of microeconomic consumption behavior materially alters our understanding of transmission channels, but has rather limited eﬀect on our general view of the aggregate eﬀects of monetary policy. Third, does inequality aﬀect the optimal conduct of monetary policy? Since monetary policy is a rather blunt distributional tool, we argue that even a central bank with an explicit distributional mandate would not deviate much from conventional policy prescriptions.
