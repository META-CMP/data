TI  - The Taylor Rule: Is It a Useful Guide to Understanding Monetary Policy?
AU  - Hetzel, Robert L.
AB  - According to the Taylor rule, the Federal Reserve sets the funds rate based on an estimate of the economy’s unutilized resources and the contemporaneous behavior of inflation. The primary policy prescription deriving from this view is that the Fed has failed to control inflation when it has not responded vigorously enough to observed inflation. However, there are reasons to question this understanding of how the Fed controls inflation. If the Fed creates inflation, it is better to pursue a monetary policy that prevents inflation rather than responds to it.

TI  - Inflation and Unemployment: What is the Connection?
AU  - Cashell, Brian W
AB  - Even at times when the inflation rate shows little indication that it is about to rise significantly, many economists feel that there is some risk of that happening as unemployment rate falls to near 5%. There are those who consider an unemployment rate below 5% to be unsustainable, or at least incompatible with continued low rates of inflation. It might seem strange that an economy with both low unemployment and low inflation could be considered a source of concern. But, many economists believe that it may not be possible to keep them both low for very long.

TI  - Overturning Mundell: Fiscal Policy in a Monetary Union
AU  - Cooper, Russell
AU  - Kempf, Hubert
T2  - The Review of Economic Studies
AB  - Central to ongoing debates over the desirability of monetary unions is a supposed trade-off, outlined by Mundell (1961): a monetary union reduces transactions costs but renders stabilization policy less effective. If shocks across countries are sufficiently correlated, then, according to this argument, delegating monetary policy to a single central bank is not very costly and a monetary union is desirable.This paper explores this argument in a setting with both monetary and fiscal policies. In an economy with monetary policy alone, we confirm the presence of the trade-off and find that indeed a monetary union will not be welfare improving if the correlation of national shocks is too low. However, fiscal interventions by national governments, combined with a central bank that has the ability to commit to monetary policy, overturn these results. In equilibrium, such a monetary union will be welfare improving for any correlation of shocks.

TI  - THE TIME-VARYING NATURAL RATE OF UNEMPLOYMENT AND MONETARY POLICY IN THE UK
AU  - Chouliarakis, George
AB  - Since Milton Friedman’s 1968 seminal paper on the role of monetary policy, the concept of a time-varying unemployment rate at which in‡ation remains stable has established itself as one of the most in‡uential in macroeconomics. Yet, although few would dispute its analytical value, empirical estimates of the time-varying natural rate have largely been greeted with skepticism. To a large extent, this is due to the uncertainty that accompanies estimates of unobserved variables as well as the fact that competing methods of estimation have delivered quite dissimilar results. In this context, the paper employs a number of univariate and multivariate methods to estimate the time-varying natural rate of Britain during 1960:1-2003:4 and examines which of these methods delivers estimates with the highest information content for future in‡ation. It also shows that, in times of structural economic change, one-sided estimates of the natural rate can potentially help reduce perception lags in monetary policy.

This strain can become particularly acute in labor markets, where it is manifested as low unemployment. The labor market tightness associated with this low unemployment ultimately leads to higher prices.

We are confident that if our proposals are given proper attention by governments and monetary authorities, unemployment can be reduced significantly in a matter of a few years.

TI  - Optimal monetary policy with imperfect unemployment insurance
AU  - Nakajima, Tomoyuki
T2  - Journal of Economic Dynamics and Control
AB  - We consider an eﬃciency-wage model with the Calvo-type sticky prices and analyze optimal monetary policy when unemployment insurance is not perfect. With imperfect risk sharing, strict zero-inﬂation policy is no longer optimal even if the zero-inﬂation steady-state equilibrium is assumed to be (conditionally) eﬃcient. Quantitative result depends on how idiosyncratic earning losses, measured by the (inverse of the) relative income of the unemployed to the employed, vary over business cycles. If idiosyncratic income losses are acyclical, optimal policy diﬀers very little from the zero-inﬂation policy. However, if they vary countercyclically, as evidence suggests, the deviation of optimal policy from complete price stabilization becomes quantitatively signiﬁcant. Furthermore, optimal policy in such a case involves stabilization of output to a much larger extent.

AB  - Europe's mass unemployment and the call for extensive labour market de-regulation have, perhaps more than any other contemporary issue, impassioned political debate and academic research. With contributions from economists, political scientists and sociologists, Why Deregulate Labour Markets? takes a hard look at the empirical connections between unemployment and regulation in Europe today, utilizing both in-depth nation analyses and broader-based international comparisons. The book demonstrates that Europe's mass unemployment cannot be directly ascribed to excessive worker protection. Labour market rigidities can, however, be harmful for particular groups. The weight of the evidence suggests that a radical strategy of de-regulation would probably cause more harm than benefits for European economic performance.

We calibrate the model and ask how monetary factors account for labor market behavior. We can account for a sizable fraction of the increase in unemployment rates during the 1970s. We show how it matters whether one uses monetary theory based on the search-and-bargaining approach or on an ad hoc cash-in-advance constraint. (JEL E24, E31, E41, E43, E52)

AB  - Before wage-pushfulness can be empirically related to the organizational structure of trade unions, the framework conditions that determine their perceived set of options must be adequately conceptualized. Although rising union density tends to increase wage pressure, the greater `encompassingness' of labour movements has a moderating effect. In addition, unemployment and the policy choices of the political authorities create incentives and constraints which shape union responses. The counteracting forces of density and concentration are presented in an interactive model based on data from 20 OECD countries for 1970-96. The article presents statistical evidence suggesting that wage-pushfulness depends on the specific constellation of density, concentration and the extent to which the political authorities are prepared to accommodate wage pressure.

T2  - European Journal of Political Research
AB  - How do governments find the political capital to raise interest rates in pursuit of inflation stabilisation? Against common wisdom, this article shows that the ability of governments to exercise tight monetary policy largely depends on the level of unemployment insurance. Unemployment insurance is particularly useful to social democratic parties since their core constituency – labour – is the hardest hit by economic downturns. Empirical evidence from 17 OECD countries over thirty years demonstrates that high levels of unemployment insurance present a strong incentive for social democratic governments to respond more aggressively to positive changes in inflation. These findings resolve the puzzle of why partisan monetary cycles are not often observed in the literature and have important policy implications, given continued calls for scaling down social insurance.

TI  - Short-Term Gain or Pain? A DSGE Model-Based Analysis of the Short-Term Effects of Structural Reforms in Labour and Product Markets
AU  - Cacciatore, Matteo
AU  - Duval, Romain
AU  - Fiori, Giuseppe
AB  - This paper explores the short-term effects of labour and product market reforms through a dynamic general equilibrium model that features endogenous producer entry, equilibrium unemployment and costly job creation and destruction. Unlike in existing work, the link between labour and product market dynamics and the policy factors driving it are modelled explicitly. The analysis yields three main findings. First, it takes time for reforms to pay off, typically at least a couple of years. This is partly because their benefits materialise through firm entry and increased hiring, both of which are gradual processes, while any reform-driven layoffs are immediate. Second, all reforms appear to stimulate GDP already in the short run, but some of them -- such as job protection reforms -- are found to increase unemployment temporarily. Implementing a broad package of labour and product market reforms enables governments to minimise or even alleviate such transitional costs. Third, reforms are not found to have noticeable deflationary effects, suggesting that the inability of monetary policy to deliver large interest rate cuts in their aftermath -- either because of the zero bound on policy rates or because the country belongs to a large monetary union -- may not be a relevant obstacle to reform implementation. Alternative simple monetary policy rules have little impact on the transitional costs from reforms.

AB  - The Federal Reserve has made substantial changes to its framework for monetary policy in recent years. On balance, the Federal Reserve has moved closer to the “flexible inflation targeting” used, in some form or another, by many foreign central banks. The Federal Reserve’s approach, however, includes a balanced approach to its dual objectives and uses a flexible horizon over which policy aims to foster its objectives. The paper uses a small-scale macro model to help illuminate the Federal Reserve’s use of forward guidance. It also examines the case for establishing a different policy objective, such as a higher inflation target or a nominal income target. The paper finds that such changes might be beneficial, but also have potentially significant drawbacks.

AB  - In this paper we study 2-state Markov switching VAR models of monthly unemployment and inflation for three countries: Sweden, United Kingdom, and the United States. The primary purpose is to examine if periods of low inflation are associated with high or low unemployment volatility. We find that MS-VAR models seem to provide a better description of the data than single regime VARs and need fewer lags to account for serial correlation. To interpret the regimes the empirical results are compared with the predictions from a version of Rogoff's (1985) model of monetary policy. We find that both the theoretical and empirical results suggest that an increase in central bank conservativeness can be associated with either a higher or a lower variance in unemployment. In the U.S. case we find that the variance of unemployment is lower in the low inflation regime than in hte high inflation regime, while the Swedish and the U.K. cases suggest that unemployment variability is higher in the low inflation regime.

Using Jordà’s (2005) local projection method, we find that unemployment rates decline in response to expansionary monetary policy surprises that can be related to unconventional policy measures. At the same time, hours worked rise. In the periphery countries, the reduction in unemployment rates is relatively pronounced, while in the core countries it is only minor. Thus, labor markets in the euro area were impacted differently by unconventional monetary policy measures.

AB  - We develop an estimated model of the U.S. economy in which agents form expectations by continually updating their beliefs regarding the behavior of the economy and monetary policy. We explore the effects of policymakers’ misperceptions of the natural rate of unemployment during the late 1960s and 1970s on the formation of expectations and macroeconomic outcomes. We find that the combination of monetary policy directed at tight stabilization of unemployment near its perceived natural rate and large real-time errors in estimates of the natural rate uprooted heretofore quiescent inflation expectations and contributed to poor macroeconomic performance. Had monetary policy reacted less aggressively to perceived unemployment gaps, inflation expectations would have remained anchored and the stagflation of the 1970s would have been avoided. Indeed, we find that less activist policies would have been more effective at stabilizing both inflation and unemployment. We argue that policymakers, learning from the experience of the 1970s, eschewed activist policies in favor of policies that concentrated on the achievement of price stability, contributing to the subsequent improvements in macroeconomic performance of the U.S. economy.

TI  - 25 Years of Excess Unemployment in Advanced Economies: Lessons for Monetary Policy
AU  - Gagnon, Joseph
AU  - Sarsenbayev, Madi
AB  - For about 25 years before the COVID-19 pandemic, inflation was very low and stable in most advanced economies. A little noticed dark side of this impressive achievement is that unemployment rates were almost always higher than needed to keep inflation low. This widespread and persistent policy error arose because of a major flaw in standard macroeconomic models—the use of a linear Phillips curve. This flaw would have been far less costly if central banks had not chosen such a low target for inflation. This paper thus adds to the arguments in favor of a moderately higher inflation target. Even without a higher target, central banks need to use a broader range of economic models and should verify their estimates of the natural rate of unemployment by running the economy hot from time to time in order to see nascent inflationary pressure before throttling back.

AB  - This paper develops the view that monetary policy operates within a set of basic constraints that limit the set of outcomes that it can achieve.These include constraints on aggregate supply behavior that determine how a given path of nominal income growth will be divided between inflation and output growth, as well as "velocity" constraints that influence the path of nominal income growth that will result from any given time path for the monetary base, monetary aggregates, or interest rates.The interaction of monetary policy decisions with shifts in constraints helps to explain the sources of deteriorating macroeconomic performance in the 1970s and early 1980s.The role of aggregate supply behavior is illustrated with a one-equation approach to the econometric problem of predicting how changes in nominal GNP growth will be divided between inflation and real GNP growth. The results from the equation estimated through 1980 are used to examine the behavior of inflation during the 1981-82 recession, and to predict the behavior of inflation and unemployment that would ac-company alternative paths of nominal GNP growth after 1982.The role of velocity is examined in a new set of multivariate exogeneity tests using the vector-autoregressive (VAR) approach for three separate sample periods (1953-61, 1962-70, and 1971-79).The major conclusions are that the monetary base has no significant explanatory role for spending changes. The Treasury bill rate appears to carry the main explanatory power, working directly on spending in the 1950s and indirectly through the money multiplier in the 1970s.

T2  - Monetary Policy and Unemployment
AB  - In Europe for a long time period, from 1979 to 1999, a pegged exchange rate system was the dominant exchange rate arrangement. In January 1999, the European Monetary System (EMS), under which the currencies of the member states of European Union (EU) were pegged within a band, was replaced by a single currency the Euro. For the time period from 1979 to 1999, the German monetary policy when it was confronted with a secular rise of unemployment in the 1980s and 1990s, operated under the EMS. Germany was the dominant country in Europe and other countries had, to a great extent, to follow Germany’s monetary policy Kenen (2002) calls this the leader-follower model. On the other hand, German monetary policy operating under the EMS, was restricted by an open economy dynamic.

AU  - Call, Steven T

AU  - Glahe, Fred R
AB  - The paper summarizes an alternative approach that has policy implications very similar to the NUR, the Austrian approach to the trade cycle developed by von Mises and Hayek in the 1920s and 1930s. Nobel winner Hayek had, long before Friedman and the development of the natural rate model, provided a model of a monetary economy and the business cycle that contained an even stronger cautions about long term adverse effects of money and credit creation. After comparing Hayek’s model with the natural rate and other new classical models, the authors’ argue that to ensure sustainable economic growth, the cautionary warning of Friedman and Hayek, contra those who would abandon the NUR as a foundation of monetary policy, is an even more appropriate guide to monetary policy in today’s global environment .

TI  - Natural Unemployment, the Role of Monetary Policy and Wage Bargaining: A Theoretical Perspective. CES Working Paper, no. 133, 2006
AU  - Collignon, Stefan
AB  - This paper models unemployment as a general equilibrium solution in labor and capital markets, while the natural rate hypothesis explains unemployment simply as a partial equilibrium in the labor market. It is shown that monetary policy can have long-run effects by affecting required returns on capital and investment. If monetary policy is primarily concerned with maintaining price stability, the interaction between wage bargaining and the central bank’s credibility as an inflation fighter becomes a crucial factor in determining employment. Different labor market institutions condition different monetary policy reactions. With centralized wage bargaining, a central bank mandate focusing primarily on price stability is sufficient. With an atomistic labor market, the central bank must also consider output as a policy objective.

AB  - This paper uses a model with a continuum of equilibrium steady state unemployment rates to explore the effectiveness of fiscal policy. The existence of multiple steady state equilibria is explained by the presence of search and recruiting costs. I use the model to explain the current financial crisis as a shift to a high unemployment equilibrium, induced by the self-fulfilling beliefs of market participants about asset prices. I ask two questions. (1) Can fiscal policy help us out of the crisis? (2) Is there an alternative to fiscal policy that is less costly and more effective? The answer to both questions is yes.

AB  - This paper critically reviews the use of vector autoregressions (VARs) for four tasks: data description, forecasting, structural inference, and policy analysis. The paper begins with a review of VAR analysis, highlighting the differences between reduced-form VARs, recursive VARs and structural VARs. A three variable VAR that includes the unemployment rate, price inflation and the short term interest rate is used to show how VAR methods are used for the four tasks. The paper concludes that VARs have proven to be powerful and reliable tools for data description and forecasting, but have been less useful for structural inference and policy analysis.

TI  - Are corporatist labour markets different? Labour market regimes and unemployment in OECD countries
AU  - Sturn, Simon
T2  - International Labour Review
AB  - Abstract. Empirical studies on the unemployment effects of labour market institutions show contradictory results. One explanation is that these institutions affect unemployment differently depending on the regime in which they operate. Because of good labour relations, institutional complementarities and a trade-off between external and internal flexibility, they produce distinctive effects in corporatist regimes. Based on empirical evidence from 20 OECD countries over the period 1985–2008, the author finds that, in corporatist labour markets, strict employment protection legislation reduces unemployment, and unemployment benefits have no negative effect. He also shows that high real interest rates, low capital accumulation and restrictive fiscal policy during recessions increase unemployment.

TI  - Conditional Patterns of Unemployment Dynamics in Germany
AU  - Nordmeier, Daniela
AU  - Weber, Enzo
AB  - This paper studies the conditional patterns of unemployment dynamics in Germany. We employ a structural VAR model and identify a technology shock and two policy shocks by using standard restrictions. Interestingly, the worker reallocation process varies substantially with the identified shocks. The job finding rate plays a larger role after a technology shock and a monetary policy shock, while the separation rate appears as the dominant margin after a fiscal policy shock. Technology shocks are relatively important for variations in the transition rates, though they do not seem to trigger the high volatilities on the German labor market. Considering policy shocks, our results point towards fiscal innovations as a promising tool, but with several limitations.

TI  - A Study of the Impact of Sectoral Shifts on Aggregate Unemployment in Canada
AU  - Samson, Lucie
T2  - The Canadian Journal of Economics / Revue canadienne d'Economique
AB  - The recent trend in macro-economic literature has been to explain cycles in aggregate output and employment in terms of unexpected nominal shocks only. In these models the natural rate of unemployment is constant. This paper diverges from this approach and, following a recent paper by David Lilien (1982), considers the impact of real as well as nominal variables. The main findings are (1) a significant part of the fluctuations in the Canadian unemployment over the 1957-83 period was caused by real shocks to the economy, and (2) most of the transmission of the business cycle from the United States to Canada is effected through real variables as well. /// Une étude de l'impact de déplacements sectoriels sur le niveau de chômage agrégé au Canada. Dans la littérature macroéconomique récente, on a eu tendance à expliquer les cycles dans le niveau de la production et de l'emploi à peu près strictement en termes de chocs nominaux non-anticipés. Dans ces modèles, le taux de chômage naturel est constant. Ce mémoire prend des distances par rapport à cette approche et suit plutôt la direction suggérée par un mémoire récent de David Lilien qui considère l'impact des variables réelles tout autant que celui des variables nominales. Les résultats principaux sont: (1) une portion significative des fluctuations dans le niveau du chômage canadien entre 1957 et 1983 a été causée par des chocs réels subis par l'économie; (2) le gros de la transmission du cycle économique des Etats-Unis vers le Canada se fait par le truchement des variables réelles.

T2  - SHS Web of Conferences
AB  - Unemployment and inflation are among the most critical phenomena facing both developed and developing countries due to their harmful social, economic, and political effects. The Egyptian monetary policy’s main objective is to maintain a low inflation rate in the medium run to keep the confidence and a high rate of investment and economic growth. At the same time, economists argue that targeting a low-rate of inflation may increase unemployment. Although the classical Philips curve indicates a trade-off between inflation and unemployment, several empirical studies have argued that the relationship between inflation and unemployment depends on the shocks’ source and lagged responses. The main objective of this paper is to examine the relationship between inflation and Egypt’s unemployment rate. We used time-series data from 1980 to 2019, where a vector autoregressive (VAR) model and the Impulse response function tool (IRF) were employed. The results show that inflation has a positive relationship with GDP while negatively affecting the unemployment rate.

TI  - Activist stabilization policy and inflation: The Taylor rule in the 1970s
AU  - Orphanides, Athanasios
T2  - Monetary Policy and Unemployment
AB  - There is widespread agreement that the objective of monetary policy in the United States over the past several decades has been the pursuit of price stability and maximum sustainable growth over time. Recent studies have suggested that activist stabilization policy rules that respond to inflation and the level of economic activity can achieve these objectives and attain both a low and stable rate of inflation as well as a high degree of economic stability.1 A critical aspect that differentiates these rules from alternative guides to policy such as policies that concentrate on inflation or stable money and nominal income growth, is the emphasis they place on the level of economic activity in relation to a concept of the economy’s potential—that is the “output gap” or the related “unemployment gap.” A prominent example of such a strategy is the policy rule proposed by Taylor (1993). Unfortunately as a practical matter, the informational requirements of implementing these activist policies, especially the measurement of the “output gap” or “unemployment gap” present substantial difficulties. As a result, activist stabilization strategies that might appear promising when these difficulties are ignored may instead prove counterproductive when implemented in practice.

T2  - Journal of the Knowledge Economy
AB  - This paper analyzes the effects of nominal wage rigidity on inflation persistence and unemployment using a dynamic stochastic general equilibrium model for the Tunisian economy. The model is estimated by using the Bayesian approach for a small open economy, allowing to simultaneously introduce nominal wage rigidity and unemployment in the labor market. Our main finding is that in the Tunisian context, the interest rate effects are mainly limited by the wage policy. The paper also provides estimates of the nominal wage rigidity implications on unemployment. Indeed, in a context of wage rigidity, a tightening monetary policy results in a slowdown in the activity level and an increase in the unemployment rate. A 1% increase in the interest rate causes prices to decrease by only 0.02%, while the unemployment rate rises by 0.2%. These results have important considerations for the monetary authorities in Tunisia. Dealing with nominal wage rigidities would be necessary in order to allow a better transmission of the monetary policy.

AB  - This paper examines the relationship between unconventional monetary policy and the US banking performance. Unconventional monetary policy is captured through the central bank's assets and excess reserves. Results show that unconventional monetary policy has a negative relationship with bank performance. Further analysis shows that the negative association between unconventional monetary policy and performance is mitigated for banks with a high level of asset diversification and low deposit funding. We also find that the negative relationship between unconventional monetary policy and performance subdues for deposit insured financial institutions. Finally, we use dynamic panel threshold analysis which reveals that the negative association between unconventional monetary policy and bank performance is particularly pronounced above the reported threshold value.

To this end a cointegrated structural VAR vs built. Since unemployment does not cause inflation at frequency zero a recursive structure, with inflation ordered first, allows the identification of a permanent and a transitory shock (cf. Ribba, Economics Letters 56, pp. 253–6, 1997). The main conclusions of the investigation are that: (i) in the short run, the existence of a tradeoff induced by the transitory shock is confirmed; (ii) in the long run, the two variables move one-for-one in the same direction driven by a permanent supply shock.

TI  - EBSCOhost | 151677669 | USING ANFIS IN JOINT DYNAMICS OF MONETIZATION, FINANCIAL DEVELOPMENT, PUBLIC DEBT AND UNEMPLOYMENT ANALYSIS.
AB  - Purpose: The modern concepts of contemplating joint dynamics of monetary policy effects on economic growth and its indicators require an indirect approach based on empirical research of mainly financial infrastructure, competitiveness of the financial markets and current economic conditions. Meanwhile, the problems of unemployment and the structure of employment within these concepts are most frequently linked with the polarization of the labor market and two important factors, that is, the effects of growth on unemployment and the fact that technological changes affect the changes in salary ranges. Methodology: By using the Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS) and the set of data from 1995 to 2016, this paper analyzes these issues through a prism of established balances between the labor and financial markets, i.e., the monetization of economy (Ml/GDP), financial development (Loans/GDP) and the share of gross government debt in GDP (government gross debt/GDP). Results: The proposed model suggests that the rate of unemployment is conditioned by the financial cycle and monetary policy (Ml/GDP, Loans/GDP), as well as the business cycle and fiscal policy (gross d/BDP) and that a controlled and properly directed level of monetization of the economy (Ml/BDP) and financial development measured as Loans/GDP can be "sufficient" for economic growth. Conclusion: Waiting in the "monetary union lobby'; i.e., waiting for the ERM II exchange mechanism can last longer than the set deadlines, leading to the need for Croatian economic policy to optimize monetary and fiscal policy measures in order to increase economic growth and reduce unemployment.

AB  - The world faces an unemployment crisis. Across the globe, an estimated 210 million people are unemployed, an increase of more than 30 million since 2007. The problem is particularly severe in the United State - the epicenter of the Great Recession and the country with the highest increase in the number of unemployed people. The article presents evidence on the extent to which this increase is cyclical or structural. But regardless of the source, unemployment exerts a heavy human toll and calls for a decisive policy response.

AB  - The author analyzes the likely impact of EMU and the associated changes in the monetary, economic, and institutional environment on European labor markets in an open economy model. He shows that in this model, the formation of a monetary union (MU) has no effect on unemployment if the participating countries were part of a fixed exchange rate regime before entering the MU and if the monetary policy of the common central bank resembles that of the former anchor bank. In addition, he discusses various cases in which this conclusion does not hold and where one can expect an impact of EMU on structural unemployment.

TI  - Inadequacies of monetarism for Developing Countries with Mass Unemployment: A Theoretical Framework
AU  - Ng’andwe, Chiselebwe
T2  - Journal of Economics and Development Studies
AB  - The paper provides a theoretical framework for analysing expansionary monetary policy impact on inflation, output and employment in developing economies with sustained mass unemployment where some unemployment is disguised under the dominant informal sector. Under the monetarist analytical framework, expansionary monetary policy does not have permanent impact on output because after initial disturbance, economy moves back to original output that is consistent with natural rate of unemployment, and the full impact of the expansionary intervention is on the price level. Thus, the assumption of full employment is the anchor of monetarist view that expansionary monetary policy only leads to inflation. Since this assumption is not realistic or relevant to developing economies, the relevance of monetarism to developing economies is brought into question. The inadequacies of monetarism for developing countries arise from the irrelevancy of two critical monetarist assumptions to the underdeveloped economies. The first is the existence of natural rate of unemployment or practical full employment. The second is that of confining expansionary monetary policy impact to aggregate demand (AD), without impact on aggregate supply (AS) Inspired by Keynes (1936), the realistic analytical model that is relevant to developing countries is developed based on realistic assumptions of a) mass unemployment, and b) expansionary monetary policy shifts both the AD and AS curves. In this model, an expansionary monetary policy leads to shifts in AD and AS to the right, leading to a new stable equilibrium with unambiguously higher levels of output. However, the change in the price level will depend on the elasticities of AD and AS (with respect to money supply changes) which determine the relative shifts in AD and AS. Since the elasticities of AD and AS are the ultimate determinants of final impact of monetary policy on output and inflation, the policy focus should be on factors that have a bearing on the elasticities. These factors are the monetary policy efficiency drivers that can be pursued to achieve high impact on output and employment with low inflation. While this framework provides real opportunity for expansionary monetary policy to stimulate output with low inflation, the practical implementation is premised on conducive conditions that should include absorption capacity of the economy for increases in money supply. A critical requirement is an effective financial intermediation system that can channel increased financial resources to the productive sector. In underdeveloped economies with dysfunctional financial systems, it may be necessary to address the challenge of financial intermediation system before embarking on expansionary monetary policy to address unemployment.

AU  - Gözgör, Giray
AB  - As an emerging economy, Turkey has suffered from high unemployment rate, as well as major discrepancies among regional unemployment rates, even in the periods of rapid economic growth. In this study, we mainly investigate the unemployment persistence at the regional level for Turkey, and we apply recent and powerful Panel-based Unit Root (PUR) tests, when the panels have small time series dimensions and cross-sections in highly persistent data. Results from the PUR tests clearly show that the existence of the unemployment persistence in most of the regional unemployment rates of Turkey. By using same PUR tests, we also test the possible divergence in regional inflation rates in same data for evaluating further monetary policy implications. Our findings show that national monetary policy can efficiently impacts on most of Turkish regions.

AB  - Recent literature on the interactions between labor unions and monetary institutions features either a supply or a demand channel of monetary policy, but not both. This leads to two opposing views about the effects of central bank conservativeness. We evaluate the relative merits of those conflicting views by developing a unified framework. We find that: (i) the effect of conservativeness on employment depends on unions’ relative aversion to unemployment versus inflation, and (ii) for plausible values of this relative aversion (and more than one union), social welfare is maximized under a highly conservative central bank. We also evaluate the effects of centralization of wage bargaining and product market competition on unemployment and inflation.

TI  - Linking Unemployment to Inflation and Economic Growth: Toward A Better Understanding of Unemployment in the Philippines
AU  - Resurreccion, Pamela F.
T2  - Asian Journal of Economic Modelling
AB  - The increasing transparency of central banks’ internal communication and decision-making methods has been a global trend in the past fifteen years. Especially since the financial crisis in 2008, the general public has demanded greater transparency from governments and major market participants.

This paper examines how the increase in information about the conduct and expectations of central banks affects unemployment rates and price level changes, especially in the context of a society in which there is a significant union presence. It finds that greater transparency fails to improve welfare when public information is released in such a way that agents place too little weight on their own information and when there is an uncoordinated-wage-decision externality among unions.

AB  - The empirical literature on the stability of the Phillips curve has largely ignored the bias that endogenous monetary policy imparts on estimated Phillips curve coeﬃcients. We argue that this omission has important implications. When policy is endogenous, estimation using aggregate data can be uninformative regarding the existence of a stable Phillips curve relationship. But we also argue that regional data can be used to identify the structural relationship between unemployment and inﬂation. Using city and state-level data from 1977-2017, we show that the reduced form and the structural parameters of the Phillips curve are, to a substantial degree, quite stable.

AB  - The aim of this paper is to analyse the effect of oil price shocks on unemployment in an oil-importing country such as Spain to determine whether they affect unemployment differently in times of financial distress. In order to do so, we use Bayesian methods to estimate a SVAR model with endogenous oil shocks. According to our results, the response of unemployment to oil shocks is clearly different in the pre-crisis compared to the crisis period. Asymmetries are also an important feature of the data: positive oil shocks contributed negatively to the evolution of employment in Spain after the outbreak of the crisis, while any decreases had less of an effect in terms of a recovery in the employment rate.

AB  - Using a VAR model of the American economy from 1984 to 2003 we find that, contrary to official claims, the Federal Reserve does not target inflation or react to “inflation signals.” Rather, the Fed reacts to the very “real” signal sent by unemployment; in a way that suggests that a baseless fear of full employment is a principal force behind monetary policy. Tests of variations in the workings of a Taylor Rule, using dummy variable regressions, on data going back to 1969 suggest that after 1983 the Federal Reserve largely ceased reacting to inflation or high unemployment, but continued to react when unemployment fell “too low.” We further find that monetary policy (measured by the yield curve) has significant causal impact on pay inequality–a domain where the Federal Reserve refuses responsibility. Finally, we test whether Federal Reserve policy has exhibited a pattern of partisan bias in presidential election years, with results that suggest the presence of such bias, after controlling for the effects of inflation and unemployment.

Overall, the results show that investor sentiment plays a significant role in the effect of monetary policy on the stock market.

This type of research is applied research so that the data used are secondary data with several variables from macroeconomic and monetary variables. The method used in this study is the first to estimate NAIRU using the Ball-Mankiw approach and to estimate the relationship between NAIRU and Inflation using VECM. The results of this study indicate that in the mechanism of monetary policy transmission of the interest rate path when using alternative NAIRU objectives, it is evident that Inflation and NAIRU have a tradeoff in both the short and long term.

AB  - The creation of an economic and monetary union (EMU) in Europe is among the most important_and controversial_developments of the 1990s. This clear and balanced book brings together economists and political scientists to explain why the creation of a European monetary union is so contentious; how the debate has affected the political determination to construct a monetary union; and how it will influence the functioning of EMU into the next century. Focusing on how economics and politics interact both in the prelude to unification and in its aftermath, the authors provide an innovative analysis of a spectrum of related issues: how EMU relates to Europe's unemployment crisis, how it will affect the process of economic adjustment, what convergence means for the performance of the member states separately, and how the member states will decide both whether to participate themselves and whom else to admit to the monetary club.

AB  - This paper presents estimates of inflation equations that suggest that both unemployment and lagged money growth affect inflation, in contrast to the views of both Modigliani-Papademos and Stein. Inflation is also strongly affected by relative energy prices. Inflation equations including the level of unemployment but omitting money growth can be improved if the change in unemployment is considered. Because inflation is affected by both unemployment and money growth, inflation's response to monetary stimulus to reduce unemployment is faster than the response implied by pure unemployment-inflation models but slower than the response implied by pure money growth-inflation models.

AB  - The paper derives and compares historical and real-time estimates of the UK natural unemployment rate and shows that real-time estimates are fraught with noise and should be treated with scepticism. A counterfactual exercise shows that, for most of the 1990s, the Bank of England tracked changes in the natural rate relatively successfully, albeit with some recognition lag which, at times, might have led to excessively cautious policy. A careful scrutiny of the minutes of the monetary policy committee meetings reveals that such ‘cautiousness’ should be taken as evidence of awareness of the real-time informational limitations that monetary policy is facing.

TI  - Unemployment, Real Wages and the Money Supply in Australia*
AU  - Pitchford, J. D.
T2  - Economic Record
AB  - Many observers have attributed the high unemployment experienced in Australia in the 1970s to the rises in real wages which have occurred in the decade. An alternative or additional hypothesis is that unemployment has resulted from policy directed at controlling inflation and that this has been exacerbated by the occurrence of adverse external factors, particularly bul not solely the oil price shocks, which have made inflation more difficult than otherwise to control. The results of econometric tests suggest that a significant portion of fluctuations in the unemployment rate can be explained by real wage movements, and as well monetary policy through its effects on the real money supply also seems to affect unemployment. Both real wage rises and monetary restrictions appear to have contributed to the jump in unemployment in 1974–75, and since then the continuing high and rising unemployment rate is closely associated with the low growth rate of the real money supply.

TI  - Fighting Unemployment: The Limits of Free Market Orthodoxy
AU  - Howell, David R.
AB  - With much of Europe plagued by high levels of unemployment, it has become widely accepted that the culprit is labor market rigidity and that the prescription can only be labor market deregulation: lower wages, higher earnings inequality, greater decentralization in bargaining, less generous unemployment benefits, more hiring flexibility, and less job security. Fighting Unemployment critically assesses this free market orthodoxy. With cross-country statistical analyses and country case studies, leading economists from seven North American and European countries contend that this conventional wisdom has greatly exaggerated the extent to which the unemployment problem can be blamed on protective labor market institutions and that the case for dismantling the welfare state to fight unemployment rests more on free market ideology than on the empirical evidence. The larger message of this book is that fundamentally different labor market models - ranging from the 'American Model' to the much more regulated and coordinated Scandinavian systems - are compatible with low unemployment.

TI  - A Long-Run Approach to Money, Unemployment, and Equity Prices
AU  - Jung, Kuk Mo
AU  - Pyun, Ju Hyun
AB  - We propose a search and matching model that can account for a long-run joint relationship between inflation, unemployment, and equity prices. The model predicts the following longrun joint relationship: (i) a positive relationship between inflation and unemployment; (ii) a negative relationship between unemployment and equity prices; and (iii) a negative relationship between inflation and equity prices. Empirical evidence for this trivariate relationship in the post-WWII US data has been documented in previous studies. We reconfirm this evidence with expanded dataset. Furthermore, our calibration exercises show that the model results driven solely by US monetary policy can account for 62.9% and 29.8% of variations of the long-term trends of US unemployment rate and real equity prices, respectively.

AU  - Eichenbaum, Martin

T2  - The Quarterly Journal of Economics
AB  - This paper investigates the effects of shocks to U. S. monetary policy on exchange rates. We consider three measures of these shocks: orthogonalized shocks to the federal funds rate, orthogonalized shocks to the ratio of nonborrowed to total reserves and changes in the Romer and Romer index of monetary policy. In sharp contrast to the literature, we find substantial evidence of a link between monetary policy and exchange rates. Specifically, according to our results a contractionary shock to U. S. monetary policy leads to (i) persistent, significant appreciations in U. S. nominal and real exchange rates and (ii) significant, persistent deviations from uncovered interest rate parity in favor of U. S. interest rates.

AU  - Hills, Stephen M.

T2  - Advances in Industrial & Labor Relations
T3  - Advances in Industrial & Labor Relations
AB  - Decreased regulation of part-time work is one way a country responds to high rates of unemployment. Proponents of deregulation argue that a more flexible labor market is required to allow labor markets to clear. A more traditional response to high unemployment is change in monetary policy, where interest rates are lowered to stimulate the economy and increase rates of employment. Both policies have been tried in Europe, a good place to study the effects of the two policy responses, both because European unemployment has been high and because the trade off between monetary policy and the deregulation of part time work has varied from country to country. The establishment of the European monetary union (EMU) in 1999 created a natural experiment in which any one country’s ability to adjust its monetary policy was curtailed, creating pressure for deregulatory policies to come into play (Aaronovitch & Grahl, 1997; Pisani-Ferry, 1998).

AB  - This paper analyses the evidence about the bank-lending channel in Chile during the period 19902002 using data from both the banking sector and the corporate sector. First, we estimate a panel data of banks to identify shifts in the loan supply curve in response to changes in monetary policy. Second, taking into consideration the evidence gathered in the previous step, we construct an aggregate variable aimed to capture the main forces behind the bank lending channel, and we estimate a VAR system to test whether or not this channel exacerbates the effect of a monetary policy shock over macroeconomic activity. We conclude that the bank-lending channel has operated as a monetary policy transmission mechanism in Chile during the sample period, having an independent and significant effect in terms of macroeconomic activity.

AB  - This study was undertaken to ascertain the impact of monetary policy on unemployment in Nigeria. This research is being carried out to determine the overall impact of monetary policy on unemployment. In this study, we empirically determined the impact of selected monetary policies on unemployment in Nigeria from 1980 – 2015. The specific objectives of this study are to determine the impact of selected monetary policy on unemployment in Nigeria, to determine if there is a long run relationship between monetary policy and unemployment. From our findings, there exist a positive but insignificant relationship between monetary policy rate and unemployment rate. It will educate the public on various Government policies as related to Monetary and Unemployment.

AU  - Gonzalo, Jesús
AU  - Taamouti, Abderrahim
AB  - We empirically investigate the short-run impact of anticipated and unanticipated unemployment rates on stock prices. We particularly examine the nonlinearity in stock market's reaction to unemployment rate and study the effect at each individual point (quantile) of stock return distribution. Using nonparametric Granger causality and quantile regression based tests, we find that, contrary to the general findings in the literature, only anticipated unemployment rate has a strong impact on stock prices. Quantile regression analysis shows that the causal effects of anticipated unemployment rate on stock return are usually heterogeneous across quantiles. For quantile range (0.35, 0.80), an increase in the anticipated unemployment rate leads to an increase in the stock market price. For the other quantiles the impact is statistically insignificant. Thus, an increase in the anticipated unemployment rate is in general good news for stock prices. Finally, we offer a reasonable explanation of why unemployment rate should affect stock prices and how it affects them. Using Fisher and Phillips curve equations, we show that high unemployment rate is followed by monetary policy action of Federal Reserve (Fed). When unemployment rate is high, the Fed decreases the interest rate, which in turn increases the stock market prices.

AB  - Long-term unemployment rose dramatically during the recent recession and remains elevated. In this essay, Andreas Hornstein and Thomas A. Lubik analyze the potential causes of this increase and explore various explanations of ?duration dependence,? the fact that the likelihood of finding a job decreases the longer a worker is unemployed. The authors find that more workers with inherently low job finding rates have become unemployed, which suggests that monetary policy may have a limited effect on reducing the incidence of long-term unemployment. The authors also discuss what lessons might be drawn from policy responses to long-term unemployment in Europe.

TI  - A Linear Quadratic Approach to Optimal Monetary Policy with Unemployment and Sticky Prices: The Case of a Distorted Steady State
AU  - Raissi, Mehdi
AB  - Ravenna and Walsh (2010) develop a linear quadratic framework for optimal monetary policy analysis in a New Keynesian model featuring search and matching frictions and show that maximization of expected utility of the representative household is equivalent to minimizing a quadratic loss function that consists of inflation, and two appropriately defined gaps involving unemployment and labor market tightness. This paper generalizes their analysis, most importantly by relaxing the Hosios (1990) condition which eliminates the distortions resulting from labor market inefficiencies, such that the equilibrium level of unemployment under flexible prices would not necessarily be optimal. I take account of steady-state distortions using the methodology of Benigno and Woodford (2005) and derive a quadratic loss function that involves the same three terms, albeit with different relative weights and definitions for unemployment- and labor market tightness gaps. I evaluate the resulting loss function subject to a simple set of log-linearized equilibrium relationships and perform policy analysis. The key result of the paper is that search externalities give rise to an endogenous cost push term in the new Keynesian Phillips curve, suggesting a case against complete price stability as the only goal of monetary policy, because there is now a trade-off between stabilizing inflation and reducing inefficient unemployment fluctuations. Transitory movements of inflation in this environment helps job creation and hence prevents excessive volatility of unemployment.

AB  - We use country-level panel data on average unemployment duration (AvgUD) to explore how the conditional distribution of AvgUD varies with primary fiscal balance (fiscal policy), short-term interest rate (monetary policy), and the state of the business cycle (output gap). We obtain the quantile estimates via a Bayesian quantile mixed effects model, which has so far received limited attention in economics. Our results reveal rich heterogeneity in both the sign and strength of these associations at different quantiles of AvgUD, in different gender and age groups, and in some transition economies that have markedly different labour markets. A higher fiscal balance/surplus is associated with higher middle-upper quantiles of AvgUD among prime-age and old-age men, whereas the empirical association is weak at all quantiles of AvgUD among young men and women. The association between quantiles of AvgUD and fiscal and monetary policies tends to be weaker among women than men. A better state of the business cycle is associated with a lower AvgUD at all quantiles among young men and women.

AB  - The twin macroeconomic variables that are significant in influencing wages in developing economy are; inflation and unemployment. Therefore, this paper examines the effect of unemployment and inflation on wages. To achieve the set objective, three models, namely; Ordinary Least Square (OLS) method, Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) technique and Granger causality test were thoroughly subjected to quantitative analysis. The result of the regression revealed that the coefficient of unemployment is positive and statistically significant which implies that unemployment significantly influence wage rate whereas inflation is positive but has no significant effect on wage rate. Moreover, result of the unit root indicates that all the variables in the model are stationary while, the result of causality test suggests that unemployment Granger causes wage rate and not inflation. This work is of practical significance in terms of economic policies likely to minimize inflationary spiral and unemployment rate in the country and theoretically, it contribution to the understanding of long-run nature of the variables. Also, it will trigger future researches and re-awaken government on its social responsibilities. Thus, the major policy implication of these results is that concerted efforts should be made by policy makers to increase the level of employment opportunities by diversifying the economy. Also, payment of unemployment benefits by the government and promoting vocational education so as to minimize the rate of unemployment.

TI  - Treasury Policy on Unemployment
AU  - Middleton, Roger
T2  - The Road to Full Employment
AB  - This chapter focuses on the theoretical foundations of the Treasury view, and the impact of Treasury thinking on policy during the 1930s. The Treasury view has been interpreted as deriving from classical economics with its implicit (Ricardian) assumption of full employment and a fixed fund of savings. The Treasury’s case was founded upon the difficulties of the staple industries, where approximately one-half of the insured unemployed were concentrated. The atmosphere following the 1926 General Strike was not conducive to an attack upon real wage resistance. The reasons for the Treasury’s dismissal of Keynes’s contention that a public works programme gained additional justification from its positive social rate of return should by now be clear. The operative forces were rather less theoretical developments or Keynes’s influence than the interaction of changing political and economic circumstances occasioned by the finance and management of the rearmament programme.

AB  - We employ a new Keynesian model with random search in the labor market and endogenous selection among heterogeneous workers to investigate the impact of a pandemic-induced recession on the distribution of unemployment across workers. In such a recession, workers whose unemployment spells in normal times are inefficiently frequent and long are disproportionately affected. This remains true even when the pandemic initially causes mass layoffs that affect workers broadly or if many separations represent temporary layoffs. Monetary policy that responds to labor market variables affects unemployment for all workers but does relatively little for the distribution of unemployment across workers types.

AB  - In oil exporting countries, especially OPEC members, oil price fluctuation has significant impacts on their economies. Herein, just a drop in the oil price causes directly many adverse effects, such as inflation, falls in economic growth, and increases in unemployment. However with a country which not only exports crude oil but also imports petroleum as Vietnam, it is not easy to determine falling or a rising oil prices is beneficial to the economy. Therefore, this paper aims to carry out a numerical analysis on the influences of oil prices on the macroeconomic variables of Vietnam, including inflation, growth rate, budget deficit and unemployment, during a period from 2000 to 2015. By using a vector auto regression (VAR) model, it is realized that a rise in oil prices would lead to higher inflation and budget deficit in Vietnam while its impacts on the GDP growth and unemployment are unclear.

AB  - This study investigated the effect of insufficient currency in circulation on the rate of inflation and unemployment in Nigeria: The Buhari’s Administration Experience; using annual time-series data ranging from 1985 to 2020. In achieving this task, the study was disaggregated into two models: model 1 utilizing Vector Error Correction Model to analyse the relationship between fiscal variables (government total expenditure, government tax revenue, and export) and unemployment rate. It was revealed from the unit root of Augmented Dickey-Fuller test that none of the (fiscal) variables was stationary at level, but they were all stationary after 1st Differencing. This made it necessary for the study to apply Johansen co-integration test which the estimated result indicated 1 co-integration equation as evidenced by Trace statistic. This also, necessitated the application of Vector Error Correction Model (VECM), and it was observed that it took 61.71% annual speed of adjustment towards long-run equilibrium from short-run disequilibrium for unemployment rate to return to equilibrium after a shock to fiscal variables. The results further explained that government total expenditure, and government tax revenue, had negative and insignificant impact on unemployment rate respectively, thereby reducing unemployment rate. Similarly, the estimated result indicated that export had positive impact on unemployment thereby increasing unemployment rate within the period under study. Similarly, in analysing monetary variables (money supply, exchange rate and prime lending rate) in model 2: Phillip-Peron unit root test was conducted and it was confirmed that the variables were of mixed order of integration which necessitated the employment of ARDL technique. The ARDL bounds testing result revealed that a long-run relationship existed between monetary variables, and inflation. It was found, in the long-run, that money supply caused inflation rate to rise. More so, the result further revealed that present level of exchange rate decelerated inflation rate in both long-run and short-run. While, it was further observed that the one-year lag and two-year lag of exchange rate increased rate of inflation in both log-run and short-run respectively. The estimated result further revealed that the present level of prime lending rate minimised the rate of inflation in the long-run and short-run. Whereas, similar results were further confirmed in the one-year lag and two-year lag that prime lending rate reduced inflation rate in both log-run and short-run. As a result of these findings, with respect to model 1; the study recommended that government should maintain the level of its expenditure and tax revenue as this reduced unemployment rate, and it should lower trade costs so that demand for labour would increase in the export industry, this would make aggregate unemployment rate to reduce. With respect to model 2; it recommended the adoption of contractionary monetary policy that would minimise the amount of money supply that caused long-run effect on inflation in the system. Furthermore, there should be proper maintenance of fixed exchange rate policy that will make exchange rate regime overcome non-military forces of demand and supply in exchange rate market, this will help maintain low rate of inflation.
