AB  - What is the most appropriate combination of fiscal and monetary policies in economies subject to banking crises and deep recessions? We study this issue using an agent-based model that is able to reproduce a wide array of macro- and micro-empirical regularities. Simulation results suggest that policy mixes associating unconstrained, counter-cyclical fiscal policy and monetary policy targeting employment is required to stabilise the economy. We also show that “discipline-guided” fiscal rules can be self-defeating, as they depress the economy without improving public finances. Finally, we find that the effects of monetary and fiscal policies become sharper as the level of income inequality increases.

T2  - Monetary Policy and Unemployment
AB  - The long stagnation of the Japanese economy during the 1990s (and now it appears even during the 2000s!) is a historical event. Explanation of this long stagnation of once such a vigorous economy is surely a great challenge to macroeconomists. In fact, a number of possible causes of the long stagnation of the Japanese economy have been offered: falls of asset price, hangover of bad loans, liquidity trap, policy mistakes, both fiscal and monetary “hollowing out” due to rising China, and so on. Most likely causes are multiple rather than single. Granted, in this chapter, we focus on a particular factor, namely uncertainty. Specifically using a theoretical model, we show that mounting uncertainty possibly traps the economy into a long stagnation. We also discuss its implication for the efficacy of monetary policy

AB  - This paper examines empirically whether central bank capital influences the conduct of monetary policy. To this end, we estimate interest rate rules for a sample of 41 countries and employ linear and non-linear regression methods to test if a measure of central bank financial strength can explain deviations of actual interest rates from those predicted by the estimated interest rate (Taylor-like) rules. Our results suggest that central bank capital is indeed a relevant factor behind interest rate policy decisions.

AB  - This paper examines the impact of macroeconomic policy instruments and external shock on unemployment rate in Malaysia. Using the quarterly data from 2006(Quarter 1) to 2015 (Quarter 4) the study found that GDP growth, price of oil, broad money supply and average overnight interbank rate have significant and negative impact on unemployment rate in Malaysia. The findings of the study also indicate the existence of Okun’s law which postulates A positive relationship between GDP and unemployment. Policy makers could formulate policies related to the above macroeconomic variable to enhance unemployment reduction. On the other hand, the inflation rate shows a positive effect but is not significant.

TI  - Trend Growth, Unemployment and - Optimal Monetary Policy
AU  - Heinecke, Ute
AB  - The resulting reduction in the relative price of the intermediate good pIt implies that, given at and wt, the marginal revenue product of labor, and in turn the match surplus, also decline.4 At the same time, a reduction in pIt implies a reduction in the real marginal cost of final good producers and therefore a corresponding reduction in the optimal relative price p∗t (see equation (19)). [...] We see that the Ramsey planner induces the largest fall in inflation, and correspondingly the largest fall in the output and employment volatilities relative to the case of price stability, under the 4 percent growth rate (dashed line).5 This is the outcome of two opposing effects of higher trend growth. [...] By raising the effective discount rate, higher trend growth strengthens the insensitivity of the wage rate to a given productivity shock, which results in an increase in the output wedge between the efficient economy and the zero-inflation economy. [...] By raising the effective discount rate, higher growth raises the sensitivity of p∗t (and in turn inflation) to a given reduction in pIt , and therefore raises the cost (in terms of markup distortion) of 16 mitigating a given degree of labor market distortion.6 In order to illustrate the reinforcement of the markup distortion by trend growth the right panel of Figure 3 shows the gap in output betwe. [...] On the other hand, by equation (22) the smaller is ǫ the larger is the implied drop in inflation of a given fall in the optimal relative price around the initial steady state.

T2  - European Economic Review
AB  - A recent literature argues that a strict monetary regime may reduce equilibrium unemployment by disciplining wage setters, as wage setters abstain from raising wages to avoid a monetary contraction. However, in this literature the wage setters are assumed not to co-ordinate their wage setting. The present paper argues that precisely because a strict monetary regime may discipline the unco-ordinated wage setting, thus lowering unemployment in the unco-ordinated outcome, it also reduces wage setters’ incentives to co-ordinate. It is shown that an accommodating monetary regime may reduce equilibrium unemployment, via the strengthening of the wage setters’ incentives to co-ordinate.

A single currency would cause, at most, small trade and investment gains but would raise average cyclical unemployment and possibly raise inflation, perpetuate structural unemployment, and increase the risk of protectionism. EMU is nevertheless being pursued in order to create a political union. Fundamental disagreements among member states about economic policies, foreign and military policies, and the sharing of political power are likely to create future intra-European conflicts. A United Europe would be a formidable participant in the twenty-first century's global balance of power, with uncertain consequences for world stability and peace.

AU  - Chang, Kelly H.
AB  - This book examines monetary policy by focusing on how the President and the Senate influence monetary policy by appointing Federal Reserve members. It attempts to answer three questions about the appointment process and its effects. First, do politicians influence monetary policy through Federal Reserve appointments? Second, who influences the process - the President alone or both the President and the Senate? Third, what explains the structure of the Federal Reserve appointment process? The test models show that the President alone, both the President and Senate, or neither, may influence monetary policy with Federal Reserve appointments. The structure of the process reflects political battles between the Democrats and Republicans regarding the centralization of authority to set monetary policy within the Federal Reserve System. The study extends the analysis to the European Central Bank and shows that the Federal Reserve process is more representative of society than the European Central Bank process.

AB  - The existence of a relationship between real growth and inflation has been investigated by economists for more than 200 years. In the decades after World War II, much of the profession came to view this relationship, represented by the Phillips curve, as describing a menu of choices for policymakers. Over the last 30 years, economists and policymakers have recognized the importance of time consistency and forward-looking expectations in monetary policy. Modern models of inflation suggest that the central bank's ability to manage the public's inflation expectations is essential to keeping inflation low and stable.

AB  - The rapid growth of financial systems and the expansion of its various dimensions in
societies have attracted special attention to this category and its effects on the
mechanisms, processes and functions of the economy. In this regard, it is very
important to investigate the role of financial systems development as the main
infrastructure for the implementation of monetary policy and the realization of predetermined policy goals. In this study, considering the policy goal of reducing
unemployment, the impact of financial development on the effectiveness of
monetary policy is examined. For this purpose, by emphasizing the two instruments
of interest rate and monetary base, in the first step, the effectiveness of monetary
policy on reducing unemployment in terms of each instrument is estimate, separately
and in the form of Autoregressive Distributed Lags (ARDL) Model for 1989: 1 to
2016: 4 In Iran, and then using rolling regression models, the effectiveness of each
monetary policy is extracted over time. In the final step, the relationship between the
estimated effectiveness and the financial development index is estimated. The results show that the development of financial institutions and markets has a
diminishing effect on the effectiveness of monetary policy using interest rate tools to
achieve the goal of reducing unemployment, but this diminishing effect on the
effectiveness of monetary policy using the monetary base is significant only for the
development of financial institutions.

T2  - Journal of Policy Modeling
AB  - This paper addresses the various methodological issues surrounding vector autoregressions, simultaneous equations, and chain reactions, and provides new evidence on the long-run inflation–unemployment tradeoff in the US. It is argued that money growth is a superior indicator of the monetary environment than the federal funds rate and, thus, the focus is on the inflation/unemployment responses to money growth shocks. Structural vector autoregression (SVAR) and generalised method of moments (GMM) estimations confirm earlier findings in Karanassou et al., 2005, Karanassou et al., 2008b obtained from chain reaction structural models: the slope of the US Phillips curve is far from vertical, even in the long-run, which implies that the nominal and real sides of the economy are symbiotic. In the light of the significant and robust long-run inflation–unemployment tradeoffs, policy makers should reconsider the classical dichotomy thesis.

AB  - The paper examines the theoretical literature of the past decade on the causes of inflation and unemployment. The basic theme is the pervasive impact of sluggish price adjustment on the validity and relevance of recent models. The insulation of real output from anticipated monetary changes, derived in the recent rational expectations literature, loses its validity when prices adjust slowly to changes in demand. The search literature explains only part of unemployment when layoffs rather than wage cuts are the major tool of employment adjustment in recessions. The ‘new-new’ microeconomics of implicit contracts, idiosyncratic exchange, and default penalties is reviewed, as are the implications of sluggish price adjustment for both ‘domestic monetarism’ and for the monetary approach to balance-of-payments theory.

Despite recent research which hints that all countries, not just pegged countries, lack monetary freedom, the evidence shows that pegs follow base country interest rates more than nonpegs. This study uses actual behavior, not declared status, for regime classification; expands the sample including base currencies other than the dollar; examines the impact of capital controls, as well as other control variables; considers the time series properties of the data carefully; and uses cointegration and other levels-relationship analysis to provide additional insights.

The relevance of uncertainty shocks is found to be much larger than that predicted by standard linear VARs in terms of (i) magnitude of the reaction of the unemployment rate to such shocks, and (ii) contribution to the variance of the prediction errors of unemployment at business cycle frequencies. The ability of different classes of DSGE models to replicate our results is discussed.

But the decline dates back to the 1980s rather than to the crisis. 4) The standard error of the residual in the relation is large, especially in comparison to the low level of inflation. Each of the four conclusions presents challenges for the conduct of monetary policy.

AB  - In this paper we study 2-state Markov switching VAR models of monthly unemployment and inflation for three countries: Sweden, United Kingdom, and the United States. The primary purpose is to examine if periods of low inflation are associated with high or low unemployment volatility. To interpret the regimes the empirical results are compared with the predictions from a version of Rogoff's (1985) model of monetary policy. Our version is consistent with equilibrium unemployment and has the realistic feature of allowing both variables to be persistent. We find that both the theoretical and the empirical results suggest that an increase in central bank "conservativeness" can be associated with either a higher or a lower variance in unemployment. In the U.S. case we find that the variance of unemployment is lower in the low inflation regime than in the high inflation regime, while the Swedish and the U.K. cases suggest that unemployment variability is higher in the low inflation regime.

TI  - Macroeconomic Theory and Unemployment: A Comparison between the Keynesian and New Classical Model
AU  - Ltd, ICB-InterConsult Bulgaria
T2  - Acta Universitatis Danubius. Œconomica
AB  - Unemployment has been a cause for concern in the political economy since its inception, and viewed as a universal problem. Both the New Classical and Keynesians models ignore involuntary unemployment, which is an effect of labour supply. Thus, a pertinent question arises; Are the theoretical constructs of unemployment the same for both schools of thought? This paper investigates and discusses the implications of the two schools of thought in relation to the mentioned constructs. Gaps in literature suggest that existing theories of unemployment and the macroeconomic theory are based on problematic assumptions; which do not allow for a seamless policy framework. This has resulted in conflicting and contrasting dimensions between the two schools of thought. The paper adopted a qualitative approach, using content review method. This involves the review of various journal articles and publications. To compare the main difference between the Keynesian School and the New Classical School, we focused on macroeconomic Equilibrium; Monetary policy Effects of Unemployment; Philips Curve and Supply of Labour. Analysis suggests that a near consensus is that there is no answer to unemployment conundrum for developing countries without them increasing their rate of capital accumulation, which must be at the same level with the growth of labour supply. The New Classical model posits that an efficient outcome is a consequence of free markets, which is self-regulating. They assume that in the long run, aggregate supply curve is inelastic; therefore, any shift from full employment will only be transitory. However, Keynesians contend that the economy can be below full capacity for a significant time because of market imperfections. Thus, they advocate a greater role for expansionary fiscal policy to over comerecession. Policy makers should support micro and macro adjustments for effective fiscal policy. The issues discussed in the paper provide a template that could assist policymakers in improving policies that aim to reduce unemployment.

TI  - Nobel Lecture: Inflation and Unemployment
AU  - Friedman, Milton
T2  - Journal of Political Economy
AB  - In the past several decades, professional views on the relation between inflation and unemployment have gone through two stages and are now entering a third. The first was the acceptance of a stable trade-off (a stable Phillips curve). The second was the introduction of inflation expectations, as a variable shifting the short-run Phillips curve, and of the natural rate of unemployment, as determining the location of a vertical long-run Phillips curve. The third is occasioned by the empirical phenomenon of an apparent positive relation between inflation and unemployment. The paper explores the possibility that this relation may be more than coincidental.

TI  - Inflation, unemployment and the position of the central bank: the opinion of the public
AU  - Prast, H. M.
T2  - PSL Quarterly Review
AB  - Recent theoretical developments in monetary policy are based on the view that the effectiveness of monetary policy is strongly influenced by the interaction between the behaviour of the monetary policy-makers and the private sector. Optimal monetary policy and the possible desirability of central bank independence are directly related to respective assumptions about the information and opinion of the private sector. These assumptions are tested in Italy and the Netherlands. Surveys conducted through telephone and face-to-face interviews show central bank independence and future inflation estimates that are higher among people with higher education and lower for those with lower education. Also revealed is a central bank that is more concerned with unemployment and a government that is concerned with inflation. The glaring result, however, is the public's lack of awareness about a trade-off between inflation and unemployment. JEL Codes: E52, E58

TI  - Why was the Great Depression not so Great in the Nordic Countries? Economic Policy and Unemployment
AU  - Grytten, Ola Honningdal
AB  - The present paper seeks to examine why the Nordic countries performed better than most other Western countries during the 1930s, when they at the same time experienced high unemployment levels. The conclusions drawn here are that the early abandonment of gold and the adoption of a more inflationary monetary policy serve as the key explanation to the relatively mild Nordic depression and the rapid recovery. However, the paradox of persistently high unemployment remains. By international comparisons the paper shows that these rather can be explained by a positive shift in labour supply than the scale of the depression. The analysis in the paper also reveals that Sweden performed more like continental Europe in respect of both the depression and the labour market.

T2  - European Economic Review
AB  - In this paper, we review the main causes of Spanish unemployment and weight them by estimating a simple macroeconomic model using the structural VAR methodology. By using this methodology we associate different causes of unemployment with shocks of different nature which have long-lasting effects due to full hysteresis. We claim that such an extreme assumption on ‘state dependency’ is reasonable, at least as a local approximation, for the period and the economy at hand. Our results suggest that the combination of a plausible mixture of different types of shock and extreme persistence in their propagation mechanisms can satisfactorily explain the dismal performance of the Spanish labour market during the last two decades.

TI  - Shocks, Monetary Policy and Institutions: Explaining Unemployment Persistence in "Europe" and the United States
AU  - Rannenberg, Ansgar
AB  - This paper examines the rise in European unemployment since the 1970s by introducing endogenous growth into an otherwise standard New Keynesian model with capital accumulation and unemployment. We subject the model to an uncorrelated cost push shock, in order to mimic a scenario akin to the one faced by central banks at the end of the 1970s. Monetary policy implements a disin?ation by following an interest feedback rule calibrated to an estimate of a Bundesbank reaction function. 40 quarters after the shock has vanished, unemployment is still about 1.8 percentage points above its steady state. Our model also broadly reproduces cross country differences in unemployment by drawing on cross country di¤erences in the size of cost push shock and the associated disinflation, the monetary policy reaction function and the wage setting structure.

TI  - Structural unemployment, labour market dynamics and the transmission of monetary policy in South Africa
AU  - Dadam, Vincent
AB  - This thesis begins by raising the following question: what is the relationship between the labour market structure in South Africa and the ability of the monetary authority to keep control of macroeconomic dynamics? The answer to this question is threefold. First of all, we investigate the empirical evidence of the existence of wage rigidities in the South African labour market. Second, we assess the impact such frictions may have on the conduct of monetary policy. Finally, we introduce public employment to analyze the e¤ects it may have on labour market dynamics in the peculiar case of South Africa. This thesis is therefore divided into three main chapters. Chapter 2 estimates a New Keynesian Wage Phillips Curve for South Africa to determine the respon- siveness of wages to employment conditions. First, we estimate the model using aggregate data. The aggregate estimation results show that private sector wages are not quite responsive to employment con- ditions, while they also reveal a certain sensitivity to in‡ation and quite a good correlation with in‡ation expectations. The relationship between private sector nominal wage in‡ation and employment is clearly weak for the whole sample, and it becomes insigni…cant at the end of the sample, indicating an increase of wage rigidities in the post-apartheid South Africa. On the other hand, the relationship between nominal wage in‡ation and price in‡ation is quite strong and robust for the whole sample but it becomes quan- titatively weak for the in‡ation targeting period. In this period, trade unions in‡ation expectations are instead strongly correlated to nominal wage in‡ation. In the second part of the chapter we look at the relationship between nominal wages, productivity and the reservation wage. The …ndings con…rm that nominal wage in‡ation has consistently outpaced the growth in productivity, even after correcting for price in‡ation. Furthermore, the results suggest that employment conditions had little e¤ect on wage dynamics. We also …nd that for the community, social and personal services sector which, mainly consist of public …rms, the response of wages to market conditions is remarkably strong. The overall picture that comes out from the analysis is that of a wage formation mechanism that is very insensitive to overall macroeconomic conditions. Chapter 3 therefore investigates the implications this picture may have on conducting monetary policy. Therefore, we use a DSGE model with unemployment and labour market frictions following the work of Blanchard and Gali (2010) to answer this crucial interrogation. In an economy with ‡exible wages, the divine coincidence holds since stabilizing in‡ation automatically leads to a stable unemployment (output gap). However when we account for wage rigidities and further labour market frictions, the results show that pursuing an objective of a stable in‡ation leads to undesirable and persistent ‡uctuations in unemployment; with a sacri…ce ratio that is typically higher the more ‡uid the labour market. The estimation of the model using South African data displays two main results. First, labour market parameter estimates present a picture with pervasive wage rigidities which thus con…rms the …nding in chapter 2. Second, the labour market appears to be characterized by large ‡ows in job creation and job destruction rates, with the latter dominating the dynamics. Finally, chapter 4 revisits the …nding in chapter 2 of a strong response of wages to market conditions in the public sector. Furthermore, the public sector in South Africa is for the most part skilled workers intensive, and has been expanding since the 2008 …nancial crisis while private …rms experienced massive turbulences. This chapter thus raises two questions: what could be the impact of public employment on overall labour dynamics? Moreover, could these features of public employment contribute in part in explaining the rigidities in wages observed in the private sector? To answer this question, we use a DSGE model with two sectors and two types of workers (depending on their level of skills), which is essentially a modi…ed version of the framework …rst introduced by Gomes (2013). In particular, we mainly investigate the e¤ects of a positive public sector wage shock on a calibrated South African labour market. For comparison purposes, we also assess the impact of a positive private sector productivity shock. We further take into account the di¤erent level of bargaining power and how the di¤erence in productivity between public and private sectors both a¤ect the responsiveness of variables. The …ndings show that an increase in private sector productivity produces more desirable results with an increase in employment for both skilled and unskilled workers which translates into a decrease in overall unemployment. Public sector wage shock on the other hand mainly crowds out private skilled labour which the …rms react to by substituting it with unskilled workers. Ultimately, the increase in public wages raises overall unemployment as supplementary skilled unemployed individuals queue for public jobs. Altogether, the e¤ects are more pronounced when the bargaining power of unskilled workers is raised.the more ‡uid the labour market.

AB  - This paper integrates the Okun’s law (OL) relationship into a wavelet-based control (WBC) model to compare simulated optimal fiscal and monetary policy for the US when the policymakers place varying emphasis on the primary macroeconomic targets of unemployment, output growth, and inflation. The simulation results show that the unemployment rate is impacted differently across frequency ranges. We find that fiscal policy is the most aggressive when economic growth is emphasized as a policy objective, whereas monetary policy is relatively more aggressive when the inflation rate is emphasized. Given that the US inflation rate was below target for the start of the simulation exercises, when it is emphasized, that leads to lower interest rates, a depreciated exchange rate, and larger aggregate investment. We also find that introducing OL into a WBC model leads to less expansionary fiscal and monetary policies when unemployment is initially low.

AB  - This article explores the treatment effects of inflation targeting (IT) on unemployment rates across a large panel of 74 countries over the 1980–2010 period. By addressing the ‘self-selection’ problem of policy adoption via a variety of propensity score matching algorithms, we first find that, on average, IT exerts no discernible effect on unemployment rates in the full sample. However, when the full sample is split into subgroups, the results strongly indicate that the adoption of IT is associated with higher (lower) unemployment rate in the industrial (developing) countries. Further outcome from a novel quantile treatment effects approach points out that the higher the unemployment rate is in the first place, the more harmful (beneficial) the implementation of IT becomes in the industrial (developing) subsample.

Negative expected inflation will face difficulties to BI in managing interest rate stemmed from economic shocks. Monetary contraction will decrease output and increase both unemployment and inflation. Conversely, monetary expansion does not experience a significant output growth. Monetary expansion should be maintained at a longer period to increase output and purchasing power, then expected inflation will undergo a dynamic process to become positive as modified Phillips curve suggested.

AU  - Alogoskoufis, George
T2  - Economica
AB  - This paper analyses the implications of monetary policy for the dynamic behaviour of inflation, in a ‘natural’ rate model characterized by endogenous unemployment persistence. We present evidence for the main industrial economies that suggests that inflation displays persistence which is of the same order of magnitude as the persistence of deviations of unemployment from its ‘natural’ rate. We provide a theoretical explanation of this fact based on a model of the dynamic interactions between central bankers and labour market insiders. The clash in the objectives of central bankers and labour market insiders is what causes both inflation and unemployment to display the same persistence in this model. The analysis suggests that inflation persistence could be addressed in a welfare-improving way, if central banks adopted monetary policy rules that targeted unanticipated changes in unemployment rates instead of deviations of unemployment from its ‘natural’ rate.

AB  - In a symmetric two-country model, fiscal and monetary policies are endogenously determined as outcomes of a national as well as international policy game. Nash equilibrium policies are characterized by unemployment (due to tax distortions), inflation and too low public expenditures. Regimes of international monetary or fiscal policy cooperation are considered. In comparison with Nash equilibrium outcomes, employment is higher under either regime. Further, disadvantages of one regime form seem to be offset by the other’s advantages. Hence, a regime of monetary and fiscal cooperation appears appropriate.

T2  - European Economic Review
AB  - This paper proposes a conceptual framework to investigate the effects of central bank independence, of the degree of centralization of wage bargaining and of the interaction between those institutional variables, on real wages, unemployment and inflation, in a framework in which unions are averse to inflation. This aversion moderates union's wage demands as they attempt to induce the central bank to inflate at a lower rate. An increase in the degree of centralization of wage bargaining (a decrease in the number of unions) triggers two opposite effects on real wages, unemployment and inflation. It reduces the substitutability between the labor of different unions and therefore the degree of effective competition between them. This `reduced competition effect' raises real wages, unemployment and inflation. But the decrease in the number of unions also strengthens the moderating effect of inflationary fears on the real wage demands of each union. This `strategic effect' lowers real wages, unemployment and inflation. For sufficiently inflation averse unions the interaction between those two effects produces a Calmfors–Driffill type relation between real wages and centralization. The paper analyzes the effects of central bank independence on the position and the shape of this relation, as well as on inflation and unemployment. The paper features two mechanisms, one of which is novel, through which monetary institutions have real effects. The model implies that if there is a single union social welfare is maximized when the central bank attaches a zero weight to inflation. But when the number of unions is larger than one this result is no longer true in general. Empirical evaluation of some of the theoretical implications, using data from 19 developed economies, is for the most part supportive of those implications.

AB  - To deal with the high level of unemployment during the Great Recession, lawmakers extended the availability of unemployment benefits—all the way to 99 weeks in the states where unemployment was highest. A recent study has found that the extensions served to increase unemployment significantly by putting upward pressure on wages, leading to less jobs creation by firms. We replicate the methodology of this study with an updated and longer sample and find a much smaller impact. We estimate that the impact of extending benefits on unemployment through wages and job creation can, at its highest, account for only one-fourth of the increase in the unemployment rate; an impact that is much lower than other estimates in the literature.

AB  - This article uses a structural VAR with daily data to identify the effects of monetary policy shocks on various longer term interest rates since the federal funds rate has been stuck at the zero lower bound. The VAR is identified using the assumption that monetary policy shocks are heteroskedastic: monetary policy shocks have especially high variance on days of FOMC meetings and certain speeches, while there is otherwise nothing unusual about these days. A complementary high‐frequency event‐study approach is also used. I find that stimulative monetary policy shocks lower Treasury and corporate bond yields but the effects die off fairly fast.

TI  - A Shadow Policy Rate to Calibrate US Monetary Policy at the Zero Lower Bound
AU  - Lombardi, Marco J.
AU  - Zhu, Feng
AB  - The recent global financial crisis, the Great Recession and the subsequent implementation of a variety of unconventional policy measures have raised the issue of how to correctly measure the stance of monetary policy when policy interest rates reach the zero lower bound (ZLB). In this paper, we propose a new "shadow policy rate" for the US economy, using a large set of data representing the various facets of the US Federal Reserve's policy stance. Changes in term premia at various maturities and asset purchases by the Fed are key drivers of this shadow rate. We document that our shadow policy rate tracks the effective federal funds rate very closely before the recent crisis. More importantly, it provides a reasonable gauge of US monetary policy stance when the ZLB becomes binding. This facilitates the assessment of the policy stance against familiar Taylor rule benchmarks. Finally, we show that in structural vector autoregressive (VAR) models, the shadow policy rate helps identify monetary policy shocks that better reflect the Federal Reserve's unconventional policy measures.

AB  - This paper analyzes an important class of models in which expectations play an important role. Topics included in the analysis are tests of: (1) rationality of forecasts in either market or survey data, (2) capital market efficiency, (3) the short-run neutrality of monetary policy and, (4) Granger causality in macroeconometric models. The common elements of these tests are highlighted. In particular, cross-equation tests for rationality or the short-run neutrality of money are shown to be equivalent to more common regression tests in the literature. These results demonstrate that the exact specification of the relevant information set used in rational forecasts is not necessary for the cross-equation tests to have desirable asymptotic properties. Also discussed are the conditions for identification of coefficients and testability of hypotheses.

AB  - We consider an eﬃciency-wage model with the Calvo-type sticky prices and analyze the optimal monetary policy when the unemployment insurance is not perfect. With imperfect risk sharing, the strict zero-inﬂation policy is no longer optimal even when the steady-state equilibrium is made (conditionally) eﬃcient. Quantitative results depend on how the idiosyncratic earnings loss due to unemployment varies over business cycles. If the idiosyncratic income loss is acyclical, the optimal policy diﬀers very little from the zero-inﬂation policy. However, if it varies countercyclically, as evidence suggests, the deviation of the optimal policy from the complete price-level stabilization becomes quantitatively signiﬁcant. Furthermore, the optimal policy in such a case involves stabilization of output to a much larger extent.

T2  - Transfer: European Review of Labour and Research
AB  - This article questions the predominant view on unemployment and wages in the European Union, according to which high unemployment is primarily caused by labour market rigidities, i.e. social institutions and regulations which prevent ?market-clearing? real wage levels and structures. The article shows that the foundations of that view coming either from neoclassical or New Keynesian theory are not convincing, neither theoretically nor empirically. Analysis of the developments in the EU during the last four decades shows that the claimed positive relationship between real wage growth and unemployment cannot be found. On the contrary, persistently high unemployment has had strong adverse effects on nominal wage growth and on the labour income share. Weakened union bargaining power and changing collective bargaining structures have contributed to this result. This article therefore concludes that the current EU economic and employment policies aiming at further wage restraint, wage differentiation and decentralisation of collective bargaining are deeply misguided and need to be replaced by an alternative wage policy as part of a growth- and employment-oriented coordination of macroeconomic policies.

AB  - This paper discusses the NAIRU--the non-accelerating inflation rate of unemployment. It first considers the role of the NAIRU concept in business cycle theory, arguing that this concept is implicit in any model in which monetary policy influences both inflation and unemployment. The exact value of the NAIRU is hard to measure, however, in part because it changes over time. The paper then discusses why the NAIRU changes and, in particular, why it fell in the United States during the 1990s. The most promising hypothesis is that the decline in the NAIRU is attributable to the acceleration in productivity growth.

AB  - Despite the rapid economic growth and poverty reduction, inequality in Asia worsened during the last two decades. We focus on the determinants of growth inclusiveness and suggest options for reform. A cross-country empirical analysis suggests that fiscal redistribution, monetary policy aimed at macro stability, and structural reforms to stimulate trade, reduce unemployment and increase productivity are important determinants of inclusive growth. The main policy implication of our analysis is that there is still room to strengthen such policies in Asia to better achieve growth with shared prosperity. In particular, scenario simulations based on our results suggests that the effect of expanding fiscal redistribution on inclusive growth could be sizeable in emerging Asia, since the estimated improvement in our proxy of inclusive growth—a measure of growth in average income “corrected” for the equity impact—ranges from about 1% to about 8% points.

TI  - Explaining medium run swings in unemployment : shocks, monetary policy and labour market frictions
AU  - Rannenberg, Ansgar
AB  - The literature trying to link the increase in unemployment in many western European countries since the middle of the 1970s to an increase in labour market rigidity has
run into a number of problems. In particular, changes in labour market institutions do
not seem to be able to explain the evolution of unemployment across time.
We conclude that a new theory of medium run unemployment swings should explain
the increase in unemployment in many European countries and the lack thereof in the
United States. Furthermore, it should also help to explain the high degree of endogenous
unemployment persistence in the many European countries and findings suggesting a
link between disinflationary monetary policy and subsequent increases in the NAIRU.
To address these issues, we first develop an endogenous growth sticky price model.
We subject the model to an uncorrelated cost push shock, in order to mimic a scenario
akin to the one faced by central banks at the end of the 1970s. Monetary policy implements a disinflation by following an interest feedback rule calibrated to an estimate of a
Bundesbank reaction function. 40 quarters after the shock has vanished, unemployment
is still about 1.8 percentage points above its steady state. The model also partly explains cross country differences in the unemployment evolution by drawing on differences in the size of the disinflation, the monetary policy
reaction function and wage setting.
We then draw some conclusions about optimal monetary policy in the presence of
endogenous growth and find that optimal policy is substantially less hawkish than in
an identical economy without endogenous growth.
The second model introduces duration dependent skill decay among the unemployed
into a New-Keynesian model with hiring frictions developed by Blanchard/Gali (2008).
If the central bank responds only to inflation and quarterly skill decay is above a threshold level, determinacy requires a coefficient on inflation smaller than one. The threshold
level is plausible with little steady-state hiring and firing ("Continental European Calibration") but implausibly high in the opposite case ("American calibration"). Neither
interest rate smoothing nor responding to the output gap helps to restore determinacy
if skill decay exceeds the threshold level. However, a modest response to unemployment
guarantees determinacy.
Moreover, under indeterminacy, both an adverse sunspot shock and an adverse
technology shock increase unemployment extremely persistently.

AB  - Purpose This study examines the impact of monetary policy on income inequality in Eurozone countries for the period between 2005 and 2017. Design/methodology/approach The authors use regression analysis, panel vector autoregression (PVAR) analysis and impulse response functions, in order to examine the impact of monetary policy on income inequality in Eurozone countries. Findings This study examines the impact of monetary policy on income inequality in Eurozone countries for the period between 2005 and 2017. The results indicate that, on average, monetary policy tends to increase income inequality. A closer examination indicates that for Ireland, Germany and the Netherlands monetary policy has no impact on income inequality or a weak impact (France), while for Spain, Portugal, Greece and Italy the impact is more pronounced. PVAR analysis and impulse response functions further indicate that female income inequality responds more significantly to monetary policy. Originality/value In contrast to previous studies the authors estimate separate models for males, females and the total population to evaluate whether gender is an important factor. Furthermore, the authors use two proxies for monetary policy: the shadow rate (SR) and the total assets (TAs) of the central bank.

(2000) it is generally accepted that new keynesian models of the business cycle display a persistence problem. In this paper, we follow the approach of Walsh (2002) and include search unemployment in a dynamic new keynesian model of the business cycle in order to study the effects of a monetary shock. After deriving the equilibrium solution of the model, we study the behavior of the impulse response functions due to a monetary shock. To complete our analysis we confront the results of our simulation to time series data for the U.S., U.K. and Germany. Our main result is that the introduction of search unemployment does improve the capability of the model to reproduce some stylized facts of the monetary transmission mechanism, however to a less extent than expected.

TI  - Optimal Monetary Policy and Exchange Rate in a Small Open Economy with Unemployment
AU  - Rhee, Hyuk-Jae
AU  - Song, Jeongseok
T2  - East Asian Economic Review
AB  - In this paper, we consider a small open economy under the New Keynesian model with unemployment of Galí (2011a, b) to discuss the design of the monetary policy. Our findings can be summarized in three parts. First, even with the existence of unemployment, the optimal policy is to minimize variance of domestic price inflation, wage inflation, and the output gap when both domestic price and wage are sticky. Second, stabilizing unemployment rate is important in reducing the welfare loss incurred by both technology and labor supply shocks. Therefore, introducing the unemployment rate as an another argument into the Taylor-rule type interest rate rule will be welfare-enhancing. Lastly, controlling CPI inflation is the best option when the policy is not allowed to respond to unemployment rate. Once the unemployment rate is controlled, however, stabilizing power of CPI inflation-based Taylor rule is diminished.

TI  - Monetary Policy and Uncertainty about the Natural Unemployment Rate: Brainard-Style Conservatism versus Experimental Activism
AU  - Wieland, Volker
T2  - The B.E. Journal of Macroeconomics
AB  - Inflation-targeting central banks have only imperfect knowledge about the effect of policy decisions on inflation. An important source of uncertainty is the relationship between inflation and unemployment. This paper studies the optimal monetary policy in the presence of uncertainty about the natural unemployment rate, the short-run inflation-unemployment tradeoff and the degree of inflation persistence in a simple macroeconomic model that incorporates rational learning by the central bank as well as market participants. Two conflicting motives drive the optimal policy. In the static version of the model, uncertainty provides a motive for the policymaker to move more cautiously than she would if she knew the true parameters. In the dynamic version, uncertainty also motivates an element of experimentation in policy. The optimal policy, which balances the cautionary and activist motives, is computed using empirical estimates of Phillips curve uncertainty. Experimentation matters quantitatively for moderate to high degrees of uncertainty. Nevertheless, gradual inflation stabilization typically remains optimal, that is, the optimal policy response to inflation is less aggressive than a policy that disregards parameter uncertainty. Exceptions occur when uncertainty is very high and inflation close to target.

TI  - An Estimation of Unemployment Hysteresis
AU  - Stockhammer, Engelbert
AU  - Jump, Rob Calvert
AB  - This paper explores the degree of hysteresis in EU unemployment rates. The hysteresis hypothesis holds that actual (demand-determined) unemployment can turn into structural unemployment. The European Commission estimates and reports NAIRUs as part of the AMECO dataset, which also inform the EU fiscal policy rules. These exclude the possibility of hysteresis by assumption. We present a simple model to estimate hysteresis effects. We demonstrate that there is significant evidence for the existence of unemployment hysteresis in the majority of the EU15 countries. In the EU15 as a whole, we find the average degree of hysteresis to be 80%. Our findings suggest that the European Commission could profitably consider alternative NAIRU estimation strategies that allow for unemployment hysteresis. These results have two important consequences for policy makers. First, they indicate that a lack of government intervention in response to negative shocks has immediate effects in the form of increasing unemployment as well as long-lasting effects on the NAIRU. This is consistent with the OECD Employment Outlook 2017. Second, as the NAIRU estimates enter the calculation of the output gap and the structural deficit, the EU Fiscal Compact should be reconsidered.

AU  - Furlanetto, Francesco
AU  - Gelain, Paolo
AB  - We study the role of monetary policy in response to variations in unemployment due to structural factors, modeled as exogenous changes in matching efficiency and in the size of the labor force. We find that monetary policy should play a role in such a scenario. Both negative shocks to the matching efficiency and negative shocks to the labor force increase inflation, thus calling for an increase in the interest rate when policy is conducted following Taylor-type rules. However, the natural rate of interest declines in response to both shocks. The optimal Ramsey policy prescribes small deviations from price stability and lowers the interest rate, thus tracking the natural rate of interest in response to both shocks. Structural factors in the labor market may have contributed to the recent decline in the natural rate of interest in the US.

AB  - This paper offers evidence on the effect of ECB's conventional and unconventional monetary policy on economic expectations in Euro-area countries during the US and EU crisis. We employ a range of research methodologies in a sample of nine Eurozone countries and combine expectations/sentiment indicators with a set of macroeconomic and financial variables. We find that ECB's conventional monetary policy (and Fed's monetary policy stance) has a positive and significant effect on economic expectations for Core Eurozone countries and a weak effect on Peripheral Eurozone countries. ECB's unconventional policy measures, however, have a negative short term effect on Core countries’ economic expectations. This result is robust to different methodologies (PVAR, QVAR, FAVAR) and different datasets. Overall, our findings highlight the importance of monetary policy in the determination of economic expectations.

AB  - At the present time Federal Reserve policy-making may be viewed as having a two-part structure. First, based on a four to eight quarter economic forecast, the Fed selects a target rate of money growth. Second, based on a short-term money market forecast, the Fed selects a Federal funds rate range thought to be consistent with the money growth target. The procedure followed in selecting the money growth target is “state-of-the-art” but the policy implementation based on controlling the Federal funds rate has permitted an undesirable pro-cyclical behavior of the money stock.

AB  - Little attention in the EMU literature has been paid to the interaction between central bank monetary rules and systems of collective wage bargaining. Analytically and empirically, coordinated wage bargaining systems respond with real wage restraint to non-accommodating monetary policy. Since wage determination is dominated by collective bargaining in all the EMU member states and wage coordination within the member states has grown since 1980, this is a topic of potential importance. In particular, the replacement of the Bundesbank, directly targeting German inflation, by an ECB targeting European inflation has removed a major institutional support of wage restraint in Germany. The consequences of this for EMU are worked out under two scenarios, that inflation expectations will be generated by ECB monetary policy and that they will reflect German inflation outcomes. Possible institutional developments are discussed including government-union bargains. The Bundesbank has also played a major role in maintaining fiscal rectitude by targeting excess fiscal deficits in Germany: again its replacement by the ECB — targeting (if at all) European rather than German fiscal policy — loosens fiscal constraints. For underlying structural reasons therefore, it is possible that Germany and other EMU countries will move to a period of fiscal activism with wage restraint and low inflation purchased through social contract negotiations.

AB  - The Australian unemployment rate has fallen to its lowest level since 1989, and looks likely to fall further, perhaps even reaching the rate of 5 per cent, widely regarded as “full employment”. However, this relatively favourable outcome has been achieved only after a cyclical expansion so long and robust that it has been widely regarded as “miraculous”. It is important, therefore, to consider whether recent reductions in unemployment will be maintained when the current expansion ends, and whether alternative policies could produce stronger and more sustainable growth in employment.

AB  - The study aimed at examining the influence of fiscal policy on unemployment in Nigeria for the period 1990-2018 with a view to ascertaining the effectiveness of fiscal policy tools in counteracting the problem of unemployment. The study used unemployment rate as the dependent variable; tax revenue, capital expenditure, recurrent expenditure and external debt as proxies for fiscal policy while inflation rate and exchange rate were introduced as control variables. Stationarity tests were carried out on the variables using the Augmented Dicker Fuller and Phillips-Perron Tests and the Johanson Co-integration Test was employed to ascertain the short-run and long-run relationship among the co-integrating equations. The OLS estimate was employed to determine the relationship between the dependent and independent variables. It was found that capital expenditure, recurrent expenditure, external debts, inflation rate and exchange rate have a positive relationship with unemployment in the long-run, only tax revenue was found to have an opposite relationship with unemployment rate. However, in the short-run, capital expenditure, recurrent expenditure and external debts reduced unemployment rate whereas inflation rate, exchange rate and tax revenue were positive. It is recommended that borrowed funds be used only for the intended productive purposes. There should be strict monitoring of government projects to ensure that every naira spent counts. The fight against corruption must be upheld to restore sanity into the polity and accountability in the use of public funds. There is need to transmogrify the economy into a productive hub, this will reduce the rate of external borrowing, inflationary pressures and enhance effective and beneficial exchange rate policy. Tax policies/regimes should not be such that discourage investments and other productive economic activities. There is need to urgently address the lack of sustained political will to implement viable economic policies and strictly adhere to every aspect of those policies. Any recommendations will be useless if not implemented to the later.

The issue is analyzed with a simple two country (north and south), two goods model, amended in order to take into account the time dimension of both the production and the decision processes. Investigating the consequences of a tariff decrease by means of numerical simulations, we show to what extent wage and price setting, and the degree of tightness of monetary policy affect the outcome of the disequilibrium process. The main result is that capturing the gains associated with international trade requires market behaviors and economic policies, which are rather different from what is usually prescribed.

AU  - Jr, Henry W. Chappell

AU  - Vermilyea, Todd
AB  - An examination of how the policy preferences of individual members of the Federal Open Market Committee are translated into monetary policy decisions.In many countries, monetary policy decisions are made by committees. In the United States, these decisions are made by the Federal Reserve's Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), which consists of the seven members of the Board of Governors and the presidents of the twelve district banks. This book examines the process by which the preferences of the FOMC's individual members are translated into collective policy choices. This focus on the aggregation of individual preferences into group decisions is unique and provides an important perspective on the evolution of monetary policy choices.To study decision making by the FOMC, the authors have used both formal voting records and detailed transcripts and summaries of deliberations contained in the committee's Memoranda of Discussion and FOMC Transcripts. The latter sources have been used to construct data sets describing individual committee members' policy preferences for the 1970-1978 and 1987-1996 periods when the FOMC was chaired by Arthur Burns and Alan Greenspan, respectively. These data are used to estimate monetary policy reaction functions for individual Committee members and to explore the role of majoritarian pressures, pressures for consensus, and the power of the chairman in collective decision making. The rich anecdotal evidence found in the Memoranda of Discussion and FOMC Transcripts inspires the narrative approach taken in two chapters, on the influence of political pressure on FOMC deliberations and on the relevance of the time inconsistency problem for the rise of inflation in the 1970s.

AU  - Einarsson, Bjarni G.
AU  - Sigurdsson, Jósef
T2  - Economics
AB  - This paper estimates the Non-Accelerating Inflation Rate of Unemployment (the NAIRU) for Iceland based on the Phillips curve using an iterative regression process and the Kalman filter. According to our results, the NAIRU rose sharply in the wake of the financial crisis, peaking at 5½% or 7% depending on estimation methodology. We evaluate what factors influence changes in the NAIRU. In particular, we assess whether changes in the NAIRU have been influenced by structural changes or changes in actual unemployment and therefore aggregate demand; i.e., whether there is evidence of hysteresis in unemployment. We find that time variation in the NAIRU is to a large extent due to hysteresis effects but to a lesser extent due to structural factors. This implies that monetary policy can have long-run effects on unemployment and its conduct is thus more complicated. Prudence in the government’s conduct of fiscal policy and labor unions’ and their counterparties’ wage bargaining becomes more important in the presence of hysteresis in unemployment, as inflationary pressures must be countered with a rise in interest rates, which can cause an increase in the NAIRU. Keeping inflation low becomes more important for the real economy in the presence of hysteresis in unemployment.

TI  - Unemployment–inflation trade-offs in OECD countries
AU  - Bhattarai, Keshab
T2  - Economic Modelling
AB  - Inflation and unemployment reduce welfare of individuals and should be as low as possible in any economy. Cointegration and Granger causality tests suggest that there are long run relations between these two variables among the OECD economies. While rates of unemployment vary significantly among these economies, rates of inflation have stabilised at lower rates as a result of inflation targeting policies adopted in them during the last two decades. The Phillips curve phenomena are still empirically significant for 28 out of 35 of these OECD economies in country specific regressions; in fixed and random effect panel data models and in a panel VAR model for 1990:1 to 2014:4. Country specific supply curves and Okun curves are consistent to thin Phillips curve relations. Leftward shifts in the Beveridge and Phillips curves require labour market reforms balancing between job creations and destructions. Complementing macro stimulations by microeconomic structural and institutional reforms can bring efficiency in bargaining for wages and employment among firms and workers to make unemployment–inflation trade-offs more significant and relevant in these economies.

TI  - Customer Markets, Inflation and Unemployment in a Dynamic Model with a Range of Equilibria
AU  - De Vincenti, Claudio
T2  - Metroeconomica
AB  - The paper presents a dynamic model incorporating a range of non-accelerating-inflation rates of unemployment (NAIRU) obtained according to the theoretical framework proposed by the customer markets literature. The analysis of the dynamic adjustments of unemployment and inflation emphasizes the real effects of demand shocks. Changes in the fiscal and monetary policy can exert permanent effects on output and unemployment, both determining persistence in the unemployment rate and selecting the actual steady-state equilibrium within the NAIRU range.

TI  - STRUCTURAL UNEMPLOYMENT IN THE UNITED STATES: THE EFFECTS OF INTERINDUSTRY and INTERREGIONAL DISPERSION
AU  - Parker, Jeffrey
T2  - Economic Inquiry
AB  - The effects of sectoral shifts, measured by dispersion in the growth rates of employment or earning across industries or regions, on unemployment are tested in a specification controlling for the effects of other labor-market variables and shifts in the demographic composition of the labor force. Interindustry and geographical shifts in labor demand have significant unemployment effects, with adult males the group most strongly affected. The estimated equations imply that most of the fluctuation in unemployment over the period 1956-87 was been due to microeconomic causes rather than aggregate demand.

AB  - , With projections showing inflation heading back toward target and the labor market continuing to improve, the Federal Reserve has begun to contemplate an increase in the federal funds rate. There is, however, substantial uncertainty around these projections. How should this uncertainty affect monetary policy? In many standard models uncertainty has no effect. In this paper, we demonstrate that the zero lower bound (ZLB) on nominal interest rates implies that the central bank should adopt a looser policy when there is uncertainty. In the current context this result implies that a delayed liftoff is optimal. We demonstrate this result theoretically through two canonical macroeconomic models. Using numerical simulations of our models calibrated to the current environment, we find that optimal policy calls for a delay in liftoff of two to three quarters relative to a policy that does not take into account uncertainty about policy being constrained by the ZLB. We then use a narrative study of Federal Reserve communications and estimated policy reaction functions to show that risk management is a long-standing practice in the conduct of monetary policy.

T2  - Monetary Policy and Unemployment
AB  - The current sluggish performance of the US economy follows one of the most remarkable booms in recorded history. The late 1990s was a period of striking expansion of both output and employment, with the unemployment rate hitting 3.9 percent in 2000; productivity growth was much improved, in part because of higher utilization, though not exceptional.1 The absence of rising inflation during this period came as a surprise to many since the level of the natural rate of unemployment was commonly estimated to be in the range of 5–6 percent by the mid-1990s. The noninflationary boom, however, reminds one of another episode where nonmonetary forces were strongly at work, namely the nondeflationary slump in Europe and elsewhere in the 1980s and 1990s, which appeared to signal a move to a higher natural rate of unemployment. The modeling of such structural slumps and booms is the task that we have tackled in a series of works in recent years, the book Structural Slumps being a milestone.2

AB  - The following essay will examine what type of public policy, if any, was pursued to combat the high levels of unemployment that plagued the American economy from early 1937 until the signing of the Lend Lease Act in 1941. The writer will attempt to explain why Roosevelt failed to bring unemployment to a more acceptable level during these years. The following chapters include detailed analysis of federal relief programs, the isolationist movement, fiscal and monetary policy, all vital components of public policy towards unemployment.

AB  - Disagreement about expected inflation is an emerging phenomenon in Finance and Economics. This real effect side of the economy and real consumption growth volatility. This paper contributes by providing its impact on stock market volatility, unemployment rate and financial soundness. It is cross-sectional study, due to unavailability of data from all over the world data is taken only from 84 countries for the year 2015. This study provides evidence that disagreement about expected inflation significantly affects these factors. The findings provide implication for policy makers and forecasters. This study contributes that uncertainty and volatility can be diminished by improving survey forecasting and reducing disagreement about expected inflation among survey respondents and an open future avenue for researchers.

TI  - Unemployment Persistence, Inﬂation and Monetary Policy, in a Dynamic Stochastic Model of the “Natural Rate”.
AU  - Alogoskouﬁs, George
AB  - This paper analyzes monetary policy in the context of a small dynamic stochastic general equilibrium model of the “natural rate” characterized by endogenous unemployment persistence. The model is based on one period nominal wage contracts and wage setting by labor market “insiders”. Product and ﬁnancial markets are assumed perfectly competitive. The persistence of unemployment results in persistent inﬂation as, under the Taylor rule, the central bank responds systematically to persistent deviations of unemployment from its natural rate. Inﬂation persists, even though prices are fully ﬂexible. The analysis provides an equilibrium interpretation of the persistence or real and nominal aggregates in the United States.
