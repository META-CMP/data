TI  - Comment on Belke and Gros : “Effects of European Monetary Integration on Unemployment”
AU  - Hefeker, Carsten
A2  - Wagner, Helmut
AB  - This nice paper by Ansgar Belke and Daniel Gros presents a result that might be new to some economists but certainly not to businessmen. Indeed, I was always amazed by the fact how economists would argue that exchange rate variability has no effect on real variables like trade or employment while the fmancial press and public statements by corporate leaders would lament about the detrimental effects of exchange rate variability. For this reason, I have a lot of sympathy with the aim (and result) of the authors that fits well into a rapidly growing literature that has begun to bridge the gap between observation and economists’ writings. It seems that there is a consensus emerging that real exchange rate changes have an effect on investment (Goldberg (1993), Campa and Goldberg (1995)), trade (Peree and Steinherr (1989)), and on employment (Burgess and Knetter (1996), Goldberg and Tracy (1999), Gourinchas (1998)).1 The paper is particularly welcome because most of the existing literature is concerned with the US and relatively little is said about other countries or on a comparative basis (see, however, Burgess and Knetter (1996)). It departs from the literature in two more aspects. First, it looks at exchange rate variability instead of exchange rate levels, as most other papers do. And, while the literature generally looks at real exchange rates, the present paper looks at nominal exchange rates, arguing that this is justified because nominal exchange rates are highly correlated with real exchange rates.

TI  - Does Regulation Kill Jobs?
AU  - Coglianese, Cary

AU  - Carrigan, Christopher
AB  - As millions of Americans struggle to find work in the wake of the Great Recession, politicians from both parties look to regulation in search of an economic cure. Some claim that burdensome regulations undermine private sector competitiveness and job growth, while others argue that tough new regulations actually create jobs at the same time that they provide other benefits. Does Regulation Kill Jobs? reveals the complex reality of regulation that supports neither partisan view. Leading legal scholars, economists, political scientists, and policy analysts show that individual regulations can at times induce employment shifts across firms, sectors, and regions—but regulation overall is neither a prime job killer nor a key job creator. The challenge for policymakers is to look carefully at individual regulatory proposals to discern any job shifting they may cause and then to make regulatory decisions sensitive to anticipated employment effects. Drawing on their analyses, contributors recommend methods for obtaining better estimates of job impacts when evaluating regulatory costs and benefits. They also assess possible ways of reforming regulatory institutions and processes to take better account of employment effects in policy decision-making.Does Regulation Kills Jobs? tackles what has become a heated partisan issue with exactly the kind of careful analysis policymakers need in order to make better policy decisions, providing insights that will benefit both politicians and citizens who seek economic growth as well as the protection of public health and safety, financial security, environmental sustainability, and other civic goals.Contributors: Matthew D.

AB  - Globalization and unemployment are two phenomena which are amongst the most widely discussed subjects in the economic debate today. Often, globalization is regarded as being responsible for the increase in unemployment, particularly in unskilled labor. This book deals with the correlation between globalization and unemployment under various aspects: historical aspects of globalization, empirical trends and theoretical explanations of unemployment, effects of globalization in general and of European Monetary Union in particular on umemployment, labor market policy in a global economy, the impact of fiscal policy on unemployment in a global economy, as well as the effects of globalization on inflation and national stabilization policy.

AB  - The research paper indicates effect statement and analysis of the relationship between the money supply and unemployment to detect the effects that the money supply has on unemployment. The research assumed that there was an effect of the money supply on unemployment through what has been proven by standard tests. The dependent variable of unemployment and the results of the research revealed an inverse relationship between the variable of money supply and unemployment, and through this relationship, the monetary authority can influence these economic variables to achieve economic stability.

T2  - American Economic Journal: Macroeconomics
AB  - We examine the impact of unconventional monetary policy (UMP) on stock market tail risk and risks of extreme interest rate movements. We find that UMP announcements substantially reduced option-implied
equity market tail risks and interest rate risks. Most of the impact derives from forward guidance rather than asset purchase announcements. Communication about the future path of policy rates reduced volatility expectations of long-term rates and the associated risk premia. The reaction of equity market tail risk, in turn, points to the risk-taking channel of monetary policy, as the commitment to low funding rates may have relaxed financial intermediaries' riskbearing constraints.

AB  - We show that the impact of monetary policy on exchange rates has been growing significantly in recent years. Our results are established by a high-frequency event study of how key fixed income instruments with different maturities respond jointly with exchange rates to monetary policy news from six major central banks. Across countries, news affecting short-term maturity bonds tend to have the strongest impact, highlighting the relevance of communication regarding the path of future monetary policy for exchange rate movements even when policy rates are near their lower bound. We find that the FX impact of monetary policy is state-dependent and is stronger the lower is the level of interest rates, in line with a greater effect through currency risk premia.

TI  - Welfare Costs of Inflation in a Dynamic Economy with Search Unemployment and Endogenous Growth
AU  - Heer, Burkhard
AB  - Recent work on money and endogenous growth finds modest welfare costs of inflation. Furthermore, high inflation reduces the growth rate. We present a monetary endogenous growth model with labor market frictions in the form of search unemployment which is calibrated for the US economy. Interestingly, both employment and the growth rate may even increase with the rate of inflation depending on the elasticity of labor supply. Considering the transition dynamics following a change in the monetary policy, the optimal quarterly inflation rate is found to amount to approximately 3.5% in the benchmark case. A reduction of the inflation rate from its optimal value to zero results in a welfare loss equal to 0.3% of total consumption.

AB  - This paper examines the relationship between monetary policy and investor sentiment across conventional and unconventional monetary policy regimes. During conventional times, we find that a surprise decrease in the fed funds rate leads to a large increase in investor sentiment. Similarly, when the fed funds rate is at its zero lower bound, research results indicate that expansionary unconventional monetary policy shocks also have a large and positive impact on investor mood. Together, our findings highlight the importance of both conventional and unconventional monetary policy in the determination of investor sentiment.

TI  - Effects of Unconventional Monetary Policy on Financial Institutions
AU  - Chodorow-Reich, Gabriel
AB  - Monetary policy affects the real economy in part through its effects on financial institutions. High frequency event studies show the introduction of unconventional monetary policy in the winter of 2008-09 had a strong, beneficial impact on banks and especially on life insurance companies. I interpret the positive effects on life insurers as expansionary policy recapitalizing the sector by raising the value of legacy assets. Expansionary policy had small positive or neutral effects on banks and life insurers through 2013. The interaction of low nominal interest rates and administrative costs forced money market funds to waive fees, producing a possible incentive to reach for yield to reduce waivers. I show money market funds with higher costs reached for higher returns in 2009-11, but not thereafter. Some private defined benefit pension funds increased their risk taking beginning in 2009, but again such behavior largely dissipated by 2012. In sum, unconventional monetary policy helped to stabilize some sectors and provoked modest additional risk taking in others. I do not find evidence that the financial institutions studied formented a tradeoff between expansionary policy and financial stability at the end of 2013.

AB  - This paper restates the post-Keynesian view of unemployment within a NAIRU framework. In the short run, the private effective labour demand need not be downward sloping because of debt deflation and wage-led demand regimes. In the medium run, the NAIRU will be endogenous because of the social norm character of wage setting and the supply-side effects of capital accumulation. Capital investment rather than labour market institutions is the crucial variable that explains changes in unemployment performance. We provide econometric evidence that the post-Keynesian view holds up well in the recession following the crisis of 2008.

AB  - While there is a fairly broad consensus regarding the potential adverse effects of generous unemployment benefit insurance on steady-state employment, the short-term effects of benefit reforms are not well-established. This paper contributes to fill this gap by estimating impulse responses to benefit reform “shocks” identified for a panel of OECD countries. Findings indicate that although it takes time for unemployment benefit reforms to pay off, such reforms do not appear to entail any negative short-run effects. There is however some suggestive evidence that reducing unemployment benefits could have negative short-run effects in “bad times”.

The results of the vector error correction model (VECM) show that real GDP at lag 2 and current exchange rate (EXR) positively affect UNER. Moreover, UNER at lag 1, money supply (M2) at lag 2, EXR at lag 2, current lending rate (LR) and its first lag negatively affects UNER. These results are robust to the satisfaction of various diagnostic tests including residual normality assumption, correction for autocorrelation and white heteroskedasticity.

AB  - This article asks why unemployment performance in small countries in European Monetary Union has been superior to that in large EMU countries. Within a model of monopolistic competition, it is shown that a possible answer is a beggar-thy-neighbor policy by the small countries. When dropping the real balance effect from a standard model of monopolistic competition, it is found that a monopoly trade union setting wages for a large economy cannot influence employment and output by changing nominal wages. A trade union in a small country which is in a monetary union with a large country, on the other hand, can increase output and employment by wage restraint.

AB  - Motivated by the growing controversy on the effectiveness of the trinity policy goals in driving socio-economic development, this study followed an ex-post facto research design to provide insights into the dynamic effects of trinity policy trade-offs on unemployment in Nigeria. Specifically, the effects of exchange rate stability, monetary autonomy and capital mobility on unemployment were examined. The external reserve is introduced to the empirical model in recognition of its role in stimulating the effectiveness of trinity policy goals. Data for the variables were sourced from the National Bureau of Statistics, CBN Statistical Bulletin and World Bank World Development Indicators (WDI) among others. Descriptive statistics, bounds cointegration and ARDL model form the basis for data analysis. The unit root test results reveal that the variables are mixed integrated. This necessitates the application of the bounds cointegration test. As observed from the results, a long-run relationship exists among the variables. The long-run result revealed that cross-border capital mobility is positively and significantly linked to unemployment, while monetary autonomy was found to exert a significant negative impact on unemployment. Additionally, the external reserve is statistically significant in explaining changes in unemployment. This finding explains why policymakers in Nigeria have continued to prioritize external reserve build-up for sterilized intervention and stimulating policy effectiveness. Owing to the findings, this study recommends that policymakers should allow for financial integration, ensure consistent monetary policy and promote robust external reserve to create opportunities for unemployment reduction.

TI  - Unemployment, Wage Developments and the Economic Policy Mix in Europe
AU  - Collignon, Stefan
T2  - Empirica
AB  - The paper considers the importance of wage formation for the policy mix in Europe. When monetary policy is committed to price stability, unit labour costs are a crucial factor in achieving this objective. Traditional Phillips curve or modern NAIRU models focus on labour market flexibility to achieve coherent wage developments because they take a short run perspective where the capital stock is fixed. However, in a long term perspective, the capital stock adjusts to profit opportunities which depend on the portfolio choices of investors which in turn are influenced by monetary policy. The time path of the price level depends then on a trend that is set by unit labour costs and a mean reverting profit mark-up that is dependent on capital costs. Monetary policy can become growth-supporting, if unit labour costs remain consistent with the central bank's price objective.

AB  - The unemployment invariance hypothesis suggests that the unemployment rate will not be altered by changes in the labour force participation rate, productivity growth and capital stock in the long run. The evidence in this chapter rejects the relevance of the unemployment invariance hypothesis. We establish that the high unemployment rate does lower the labour force participation rate in the long run, consistent with the ‘discouraging worker effects’ channel. Furthermore, evidence shows that labour market reforms work via their influence on labour demand and wage settings. Moreover, price stability matters for the pass-through of loose labour market reforms to the unemployment rate, as high inflation expectations dampen the rate at which the unemployment rate falls due to loosening in the labour market reforms shocks. The rejection of the ‘unemployment invariance hypothesis’ suggests that policies which stimulate investment or improve innovation and technology or change the size of the labour force will have an effect on the unemployment rate in the long run. Hence, various policy interventions in the labour market can be used to mitigate the ‘discouraged worker effects’.

TI  - Effects of Macroeconomic Shocks on Unemployment Rates Across the Euro Area
AU  - Wang, Zhe
AB  - This thesis studies the effects of macroeconomic shocks on unemployment rates across the Euro Area (EA) over the course of a whole business cycle. It consists of three main chapters. Chapter 1 focuses on identifying whether common monetary policy shocks conducted by the European Central Bank (ECB) have effects on national unemployment rates in the member-states of the European Monetary Union (EMU), and how heterogenous the effects are.1 Chapter 2 examines the extent to which the effects of shocks on unemployment are intermediated by various labor market institutions associated with each of the EA national economies. Chapter 3 looks at gender unemployment differences, asking whether an adverse shock leads to a larger increase in the unemployment rate for females relative to males, taking into account the role of labor market institutions.

TI  - Youth Unemployment in the OECD: Demographic Shifts, Labour Market Institutions, and Macroeconomic Shocks
AU  - Jimeno, Juan F.
AU  - Rodriguez-Palenzuela, Diego
AB  - We use a panel of OECD countries to gauge the relevance of the relative size of the youth population, labour market institutions and macroeconomic shocks at explaining observed relative youth unemployment rates. We find that the fluctuations of the youth population size caused by the baby boom of the 1950s and 1960s and the subsequent decline of fertility in many European countries are positively associated with fluctuations in relative youth unemployment rates. We also find that some labour market institutions contribute to increase youth unemployment, and that the adjustement to macroeconomic shocks has affected relatively more to young workers than to adult workers. To motivate the effects of institution on the relative unemployment rate of young workers, we lay out a simple theoretical model that builds on the imperfect substitutability of workers of different ages, and on the non-allocative role of (age specific) wages.

AB  - In the process of EU integration, toward the Eurozone (EA) accession, we try to understand, how changes in exchange rate regimes, attributed to the switch through the ERM-II and to the EA accession, influence the dynamic between inflation and unemployment, that is, swings on the Phillips curve coefficient. We look at a panel of EA countries, before and after their EA entry, over the last twenty years, using a recent work from McLeay and Tenreyro (2020), to clarify the impact of losing the monetary autonomy. Accession to the Eurozone leads to a non-significant inflation/unemployment relationship. We link this result to the fact that the small economies of the Eurozone do not have sufficient weight to influence the single monetary policy. This is corroborated by the fact that within the Eurozone, what we call the “economic leaders” maintain a significant trade-off between inflation and unemployment.

AB  - Since the worst employment slumps follow periods of high household debt and almost all household debt is provided by banks, there is a natural link between bank lending and employment. Building on this, we theoretically investigate whether bank regulation can play a role in stimulating employment. Using a competitive search model, we find that levered households suffer from a debt overhang problem that distorts their preferences, making them demand high wages. In general equilibrium, firms internalize these preferences and post high wages but few vacancies. This vacancy-posting effect implies that high household debt leads to high unemployment. Unemployed households default on their debt. In equilibrium, the level of household debt is inefficiently high due to a household-debt externality--banks fail to internalize the effect that household leverage has on household default probabilities via the vacancy-posting effect. As a result, household debt levels are inefficiently high. Our results suggest that a combina- tion of loan-to-value caps for households and capital requirements for banks can elevate employment and improve efficiency, providing an alternative to monetary policy for labor market intervention.

TI  - Unemployment in OECD-countries: does economic policy matter?
AU  - Creel, J
AB  - We use panel data methodology to capture cross-section and time-series dimensions of unemployment growth in OECD countries and their links with fiscal and monetary policies. We did test for the robustness of every explanatory variables according to Levine and Renelt (1992) methodology. The entire data set covers 6 areas: general economic structure; macroeconomic environment; the role of the state; labour market structure; monetary and fiscal policies. Three different periods are studied so that regime shifts can be taken into account. Different proxies for economic policies are tested. Alternative explanations for unemployment growth based on economic policies generally weakly fit the data, except over the last sub-period. Joint-effects with labour institutions and crosseffects give better results. For instance, between 1990 and 1995, cross-effects of fiscal policy and institutions seem very relevant to the unemployment issue. It seems as if economic policies had never been more important and productive than in the early nineties, though their effects are generally criticised by “mainstream” economists.

TI  - Money supply growth and unemployment rate in Nigeria: Investigating a long-run relationship using asymmetric ARDL approach
AU  - Bassey, Kufre J.
T2  - West African Journal of Monetary and Economic Integration
AB  - This paper examines the role of money supply in determining unemployment rate in Nigeria. We employ a nonlinear autoregressive distributed lag (NARDL) model to examine the pass-through effect of the growth in money supply into unemployment rate using time series data over the period 1985 - 2015. Our approach allows for simultaneous test of the short- and long-run nonlinearities characterizing many macroeconomic variables through positive and negative partial sum decompositions of the money supply growth. We obtain the asymmetric dynamic multiplier that graphically depicts the traverse between the short- and the long-run responses of unemployment rates to the positive and negative money supply growth shocks. Our result suggests that money supply plays an important role and reveal that there is a significant pass- through effect of the money supply growth to unemployment rate in the long run. This finding infers that imposing a long- run symmetry where the underlying relationship is actually nonlinear will confound efforts to test for the existence of a stable long-run relationship between unemployment and money supply growth in Nigeria, and hence results in spurious dynamic responses. It also underscores the importance of correctly capturing short-run symmetries (asymmetries) in order to illuminate potentially important differences in the response of policy makers to positive and negative shocks.

TI  - Does gender matter for the unemployment hysteresis effect among Asian countries?
AU  - Li, Zheng-Zheng
AU  - Su, Chi Wei
AU  - Tao, Ran
T2  - International Journal of Manpower
AB  - Purpose This study aims to examine the unemployment hysteresis effects from the perspective of the heterogeneity of genders within Asian countries. Design/methodology/approach The authors use the annual unemployment rate dataset of 12 Asian countries ranging from 1991–2020. Traditional unit root tests are initially employed to investigate the unemployment hysteresis effect. Considering the structural break and cross-section dependence problems, the sequential panel selection method (SPSM) and the Kapetanios–Snell–Shin (KSS) panel unit root test with Fourier functions have proven to be more applicable. Findings The empirical results indicate that the unemployment rate is stationary in most Asian regions for both females and males, which confirms the mean reversion process of the natural unemployment hypothesis. This suggests that these countries' unemployment rates are flexible to quickly revert to its long-run equilibrium determined by the labor markets. However, only the female unemployment rate in Pakistan and Nepal and adult female unemployment rates in these two economies present non-stationary series. In line with the unemployment hysteresis effect, it means shocks will leave a permanent impact on their labor market. Practical implications On the one hand, in most of the Asian countries, it can be inferred that the trade-off between inflation and unemployment is temporary because the natural unemployment hypothesis holds. Therefore, policymakers may consider using monetary policy as a tool to control inflation and stimulate growth during a recession. Such policy measures should not have a long-run impact on unemployment or cause a permanent shift in the natural unemployment rate. On the other hand, the government should implement active labor protective programs such as education or training schemes, job search assistance programs and maternity protection, especially for female adults, to reduce the negative shocks in the economic downturn, which is beneficial for them away from being long-term unemployed. It is also necessary to improve the labor unions to reduce the discrimination between female and male labors. Originality/value This paper innovatively concentrates on the heterogeneity performances between genders about the unemployment hysteresis effect within Asian countries. Furthermore, taking into account the age-specific characteristics, the youth and adult unemployment rates have been investigated. Additionally, the approximation of bootstrap distribution and the advanced panel KSS unit root test with a Fourier function are employed. Thereby, targeted policies for the government can be applied to reduce the discrimination and negative shocks on female adults in the labor market.

AU  - Ioannidou, Vasso P.
T2  - Journal of Financial Intermediation
AB  - This paper examines whether monetary policy responsibilities alter the central bank's role as a bank supervisor. The analysis focuses on the United States, where the Federal Reserve System shares supervisory duties with the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. Among the three institutions, the Fed is the only one responsible for monetary policy. Hence, the Fed's supervisory behavior—as captured by formal actions—is compared with the behavior of the other two agencies. The results suggest that the Fed's monetary policy responsibilities do alter its bank supervisory behavior: indicators of monetary policy affect the supervisory actions of the Fed, but do not affect the actions of the other two agencies.

Model simulations indicate that, by 2012, the past and projected expansion of the Fed’s securities holdings since late 2008 will lower the unemployment rate by 1½ percentage points relative to what it would have been absent the purchases. The asset purchases also have probably prevented the U.S. economy from falling into deflation.

TI  - Effect Of Fiscal Policy On Unemployment In The Nigerian Economy
AU  - Godslove, EGBULONU Kelechukwu
AU  - Wobilor, AMADI Kingsley
AB  - The study examined the relationship between fiscal policy and unemployment rate in Nigeria for the period 1970 to 2013. Data for the study were sourced from the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) and the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) Statistical Bulletin (various editions), and consists of Government Expenditure, Government Debt Stock (as proxy for Government borrowing), Government Tax Revenue and Unemployment rate. The data were tested for Stationarity using Augumented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) Unit Root test. The test revealed that all the variables used in the study are stationary at their first difference [i.e. 1(1)]. The data were also subjected to co-integration test in order to know whether using the variables together in the model would produce reliable results. The test revealed that a long run relationship between unemployment rate and fiscal policy tools used in the study which satisfy the condition for our fitting a parsimonious Error Correction Model (ECM) to the data. We found a negative relationship between fiscal policy tools (government expenditure and government debt stock) and unemployment rate in Nigeria while government tax revenue exhibited a positive relationship with unemployment rate. This means that increase in tax rate reduces employment in Nigeria. The results also reveal that, there exist a long-run equilibrium relationship between unemployment and fiscal policy in Nigeria. The study recommended that government should increase her capital expenditure mostly on infrastructure as this will help improve national income and create more employment in the economy. Borrowed funds by the government should be invested properly on capital and physical goods which will stimulate national incomes and create more jobs. Government should also intensify fight against corruption to mitigate diversion of government funds to private pockets. The study also recommends strong implementation of viable fiscal and monetary policy mix as well as diversify the nation’s economic base in order to expand the employment base of the nation.

AB  - The paper first reviews the conceptual framework underlying different measures of structural unemployment as well as alternative empirical methods that have been used to provide estimates of them. Drawing on this review, it goes on to develop a method for estimating time-varying NAIRUs across a range of OECD countries using a Kalman filter. It then discusses the resulting econometric estimates, and the scope for their further refinement given the associated range of uncertainties. Recent trends in the NAIRU estimates are reviewed: they fell in many countries in the second half of the 1990s, although actual unemployment has remained well above the NAIRU for a majority of countries throughout much of the 1990s, particularly in Europe. Finally, the relevance of such measures to analysing inflation developments and monetary policy is discussed.

AB  - In this paper we aim to investigate the effects of several types of shocks on unemployment in peripheral European countries under the EMU. We use a structural near-VAR model to account for the supranational conduct of monetary policy on the one hand, and domestic fiscal policy and financial shocks on the other hand. Our main findings are: (i) the unemployment multipliers of government spending shocks are higher than the ones associated with government revenues shocks, and they vary across countries; (ii) instability in the unemployment responses over time is marked, with evidence that a regime shift took place in some countries since 2007; (iii) fiscal and financial shocks are not among the long-term drivers of unemployment, but instead a more important role is played by Euro area-wide shocks, with a pre-eminent role for the common monetary policy shock.

AU  - Domanski, Dietrich

AB  - This feature explores the recent evolution of household wealth inequality in advanced economies by looking at valuation effects on household assets and liabilities. Using household survey data, we analyse the possible drivers of wealth inequality and the potential effect of monetary policy through its impact on interest rates and asset prices. Our simulation suggests that wealth inequality has risen since the Great Financial Crisis. While low interest rates and rising bond prices have had a negligible impact on wealth inequality, rising equity prices have been a key driver of inequality. A recovery in house prices has only partly offset this effect. Abstracting from general equilibrium effects on savings, borrowing and human wealth, this suggests that monetary policy may have added to inequality to the extent that it has boosted equity prices.

The aim of this article is to analyze the macroeconomic determinants of the unemployment rate in Romania, using an econometric model. We use the GDP, net and gross wage, monetary policy rate, inflation rate, budget deficit, average RON/EUR exchange rate, export and import values to estimate the model. The analyzed period is 2000-2009.

AB  - Downturns in the construction and finance sectors played a significant role in the recent recession. A stock-market-based measure that captures sectoral shocks shows that these disturbances are important for explaining long-duration unemployment. This is consistent with the intuition that sectoral shocks cause workers to engage in time-consuming moves across industries in their searches for work. It also suggests that it will take a while before the more than 1.8 million unemployed construction workers and close to a half million unemployed finance and insurance workers find jobs.

TI  - Do interest rate and inflation affect unemployment? evidence from Australia Munich Personal RePEc Archive
AB  - This paper explores the Granger-causal relationship between monetary policy, represented by interest rate and inflation rate, and the unemployment rate in Australia using the standard time series techniques. The analysis uses quarterly data covering a ten-year period. Interest rates used here is the long term interest rate, inflation rate is represented by the CPI excluding food and energy, and unemployment rates is measured in percentage-form for Australia. The findings evidence a positive long term (theoretical) relationship between interest rate and unemployment, and a negative long term relationship between inflation and unemployment. It also suggests that interest rate is the strongest exogenous variable, followed by the inflation rate, in determining unemployment. As such, it is recommended for the policy makers of small open economies such as, Australia to control the exogenous variables in order to achieve a certain desired target of unemployment rate. Or, should these two relatively exogenous variables be to some extent “uncontrollable” due to factors such as, crisis and calamity, their movements could be reliable indicators for the governments to embark on contingency plans to minimize the impact of unemployment.

TI  - Pigou's theory of business cycle as an inquiry into unemployment: on the relative effects of the gold standard and the wage rigidity in the twenties
AU  - Takami, Norikazu
T2  - Discussion Papers in Economics and Business
AB  - In this paper I examine A. C. Pigou's views on the unemployment policies, based on the premise that, as he himself acknowledged, his theory of business fluctuations was one integral part of his whole thought about unemployment. In his Industrial Fluctuations (1927), Pigou gave the most extensive treatment to the monetary policy among the measures against business fluctuations. There he advocated more prompt and smooth action by the Bank of England in order to effectively stabilize the movement of general prices and the economy as a whole. In order for its action not to be affected by external monetary shocks, he suggested the withdrawal from the gold standard should the public opinion and international diplomatic relations allow it. Pigou, meanwhile, placed much less importance on wage adjustment as a palliative against business cycle. The recent studies direct attention to the fact that Pigou pointed out that after World War I money wages were made rigid by such factors as contemporary institutional changes in labor markets. This picture, however, lacks a more important element of his thought: the monetary cause due to the gold standard on the prewar parity. Putting his indirect remarks on this influence together, I argue that Pigou was well aware of the monetary situation and seemed to place greater importance on the monetary influence than the wage rigidity.

TI  - Inﬂation and Unemployment: Do Goods or Labor Markets Matter?
AU  - Liu, Lucy Qian
AB  - Empirical evidence on inﬂation and unemployment suggests that they can be either positively or negatively related in the long run. This paper studies this relationship in an environment in which inﬂation has diﬀerential eﬀects on employed and unemployed workers. Due to trading frictions in the goods market, unemployed workers consume more cash-intensive goods than employed ones, and therefore are more vulnerable to the inﬂation tax. A higher rate of inﬂation reduces the outside options for workers and generates a negative eﬀect on unemployment. On the other hand, inﬂation also lowers a ﬁrm’s return from posting job vacancies, thereby raising unemployment. In equilibrium the long-run inﬂation-unemployment relation is either positive or negative. The sales tax and degree of competition in the goods market are the most important factors that determine the direction of this relationship. Overall if the outcomes of labor market is eﬃcient (satisfying Hosios condition), the optimal monetary policy is at the Friedman rule.

We focus on Tunisia as an emerging economy with challenging characteristics for this technique, mainly high involuntary unemployment and an important informal sector. Our results confirm the effectiveness of this technique and the policy implication we derive is the superiority of cross-checking over discretion as an optimal monetary policy framework when the central bank is unable to commit to a target.

TI  - Impact of Macroeconomic Policies on Poverty and Unemployment Rates in Nigeria, Implications for Attaining Inclusive Growth
AU  - Nwosa, Philip Ifeakachukwu
T2  - Acta Universitatis Danubius. Œconomica
AB  - This paper examined the effect of macroeconomic policies on unemployment and poverty rates in Nigeria from 1980 to 2013 with implication to achieving inclusive growth. The inability of macroeconomic policies in addressing the rising issues unemployment and poverty rates in Nigeria despite the impressive economic growth experience over the last decades has increasingly called for the need for the pursuance of inclusive growth to address the social issues of unemployment and poverty rate. Previous studies have not considered the extent to which macroeconomic policies affects unemployment and poverty rate in Nigeria, and the implication of this relationship to the attainment of inclusive growth in Nigeria. The study adopts the Ordinary Least Square (OLS) technique. The study observed that among macroeconomic policy variables only exchange rate significantly influenced unemployment rate while only fiscal policy significantly influenced and poverty rate. This implies that present macroeconomic policies in Nigeria do not guarantee the attainment of inclusive growth in Nigeria. The contribution of the paper is that to achieve inclusive growth that guarantees high employment and reduced poverty rate, there is the need for a re-examination of macroeconomic policy management in Nigeria.

Thus, according results showed by ARDL estimation, in long run Fiscal Policy and Trade Policy provoke an increase on Unemployment rate, respectively; while Consumer Price index has a statistical and significant negative effect on the Unemployment. The results of Markov-switching dynamic regression, when we consider high-growth Unemployment in long term, shows the variables Monetary Policy, Consumer Price and Trade Policy indexes have a negative and significant impact on Unemployment, while, Fiscal Policy and Geo Political Risk presents a positive and significant effect on Unemployment. Moreover, this results also contribute to explain the changes occurred and the duration of these same transition periods of the two regimes, regime of expansion for regime of recession in the labor market contributed greatly to the effects of the various categories of uncertain economic policies. This paper will be interesting for a broad range of labor market participants. The investors' perception of monetary policy, fiscal policy, geopolitical risk, Equity Market volatility will shape the US economic anxiety, the economic policy uncertainty and the labor market behavior.

AB  - Using a sample of 97 countries spanning the period 1980?2008, we estimate that financial crises have a large negative impact on unemployment in the short term, but that this effect rapidly disappears in the medium term in countries with flexible labor market institutions, whereas the impact of financial crises is less pronounced but more persistent in countries with more rigid labor market institutions. These effects are even larger for youth unemployment in the short term and long-term unemployment in the medium term. Conversely, large upfront, or gradual but significant, comprehensive labor market policies have a positive impact on unemployment, albeit only in the medium term.

AB  - Dynamic relationship among unemployment rate and key macroeconomic variables is explored for the Serbian economy that has been characterized by high unemployment rates since the outcome of the Great Recession. This analysis reveals how effective policy measures can be in reducing unemployment rate. Cointegrated vector autoregressive model is employed for period 2014-2019. Prior to multivariate dynamic modelling, the validity of hysteresis hypothesis for unemployment rate is assessed. Our results show significant negative long-run effect of real wages on unemployment rate, and positive long-run effect of real effective exchange rate appreciation on real wages. For further reduction of unemployment rate demand-side measures should be employed and real exchange rate depreciation should be avoided.

AB  - At the end of the last decade, the real activity in Colombia underwent the sharpest recession of the last fifty years. We postulate a non-triangular structural VAR model (Amisano and Giannini, 1997) to describe the dynamics of output, prices, unemployment and wages during the last two decades. The evidence suggests that, in the long-run, monetary policy has been neutral to both output and unemployment while the main reasons for the increase in the latter have been the lack of credibility of monetary policy, the way in which wages are set and the increase in non-wage labor costs.

AB  - We apply multivariate filtering techniques to quantify structural unemployment (NAIRU), potential output, output gap and unemployment gap for South Africa, Kenya, Mauritius and Ghana. NAIRU estimates are especially relevant for these inflation-targeting or hybrid inflation-targeting economies, allowing them to assess level of domestic slack and any potential build-up of inflationary pressures. Our findings suggest that increased government spending on education, a competitive exchange rate, and boosting the level of financial development (measured as the market capitalization of listed companies) can play a role in lowering NAIRU in these Sub-Saharan African countries.

We present new empirical evidence obtained from the use of Canadian time-series data which lends support to the claim that the aggregate capital-output ratio, the real price of imports and the degree of generosity of the unemployment subsidy system were determinants of the NAIRU in the period considered. We believe this evidence suggests that, insofar as the aggregate capitaloutput ratio is affected by changes in real interest rates, then the stance of monetary policy was one determinant of the NAIRU in the period considered.

T2  - Australian Economic Review
AB  - The major failures of macroeconomic policy in the last 40 years are the huge increases in unemployment and inflation in the 1970s and the persistence for 25 years of the former. This article uses econometric estimates of a model of the range of equilibria for Australia for the period 1965:4 to 2003:3 to evaluate the role of macroeconomic policies in these failures. Our analysis distinguishes the roles of aggregate supply policies and aggregate demand policies. We conclude from our analysis that macroeconomic outcomes would have been better over this period had monetary policy been guided by a hierarchical inflation target, which is to be set so as to achieve the highest level of activity subject to satisfying the inflation target.

TI  - EFFECT OF UNEMPLOYMENT AND INFLATION ON ECONOMIC GROWTH IN NIGERIA
AU  - ., Miftahu
AB  - The instability of unemployment and inflation has attracted the attention of policymakers especially on how to maintain low and stable unemployment as well as relatively stable prices so as to achieve high economic growth. However, it appears that government intervention has not been able to cure the ills in the Nigerian economy. In order words, full potentials of labour-surplus have not been fully exploited. In view of the aforementioned, this study investigates the effect of unemployment and inflation on economic growth in Nigeria using annual time series data covering the period of 1986 to 2020. To examine the model coefficient, ordinary least square technique is employed. Findings indicate that the coefficient of unemployment has a negative and significant effect on economic growth in Nigeria; while inflation exerts a positive effect. The nature of unemployment and inflation characterizing the Nigerian economy are structural and cost-push respectively; hence the need by the government and relevant agencies to formulate policies to encourage self-employment and reduce cost of doing business so as to achieve a high, rapid and sustainable economic growth. Introduction The Nigerian economy has remained largely underdeveloped despite the huge human and natural resources. The country is richly endowed with various mineral types all over the country. Huge amount is generated annually from petroleum products. More than 40 types of solid minerals have been identified in over 500 locations in the country Musa (2010). Yet the per capita income is low, unemployment and inflation rates are high. There are many socioeconomic challenges. The economy has continued to witness economic recovery which is immediately followed by economic recession and depression. The situation in Nigeria is disturbing. The various macroeconomic policies by government have been unable to achieve sustained price stability, reduction in unemployment and sustained growth cannot be achieved. The poor state of the economy has confirmed the need to manage the economy effectively. The essence of macroeconomic management underlines the rationale for the existence of government as a vital economic agent. However, it appears that government intervention has not been able to cure the ills in the Nigerian economy. The continued economic crisis, with the associated problems of high inflationary pressure, high exchange rate, and debt overhang, adverse balance of payment and high inflation rates is difficult to explain. Against a high rate of unemployment and underemployment, a large public sector, low wages and poor working conditions has been persistent high inflation rates in Nigeria. Also, underemployment and unemployment is a prominent feature of the Nigerian economy. Consequently, the full potentials of labour-surplus economy have not been fully exploited.

TI  - Beyond carbon pricing: The role of banking and monetary policy in financing the transition to a low-carbon economy
AU  - Campiglio, Emanuele
T2  - Ecological Economics
AB  - It is widely acknowledged that introducing a price on carbon represents a crucial precondition for filling the current gap in low-carbon investment. However, as this paper argues, carbon pricing in itself may not be sufficient. This is due to the existence of market failures in the process of creation and allocation of credit that may lead commercial banks — the most important source of external finance for firms — not to respond as expected to price signals. Under certain economic conditions, banks would shy away from lending to low-carbon activities even in the presence of a carbon price. This possibility calls for the implementation of additional policies not based on prices. In particular, the paper discusses the potential role of monetary policies and macroprudential financial regulation: modifying the incentives and constraints that banks face when deciding their lending strategy — through, for instance, a differentiation of reserve requirements according to the destination of lending — may fruitfully expand credit creation directed towards low-carbon sectors. This seems to be especially feasible in emerging economies, where the central banking framework usually allows for a stronger public control on credit allocation and a wider range of monetary policy instruments than the sole interest rate.

TI  - Dynamic analysis of money supply, unemployment and inflation rate in the US
AU  - WANG, Guangyu
T2  - Dissertations and Theses Collection (Open Access)
AB  - Price stability is not only an important indicator of the healthy and stability of macro-economy, but also one of the goals of macroeconomic policy. There are many factors affecting inflation. Different monetary policy instruments, such as money supply, liquidity and market expectations, have different effects on inflation. Meanwhile, monetary policy goals, such as inflation rate, employment rate and economic growth rate, also affect each other.

This paper provides an empirical study of money supply, inflation and unemployment in the US economy. Based on the existing theoretical and empirical analysis, this paper selects different research models and new data dimensions to study the relationship between money supply, unemployment and inflation from different angles for both theoretical and empirical aspects. This paper analyzes and defines the historical impact based on three-dimensional VAR model. In order to construct a multi-dimensional VAR model for analysis, this paper chooses the money supply in the monetary policy instruments and the unemployment rate in the monetary policy goals as the endogenous variables affecting inflation, and chooses the import price stably related to the growth of money supply as the exogenous variable. This paper uses the consumer price index (CPI) to represent the inflation rate and M1 money supply to represent the monetary aggregate. Finally, through the comparative analysis of inflation between China and the US, the paper puts forward some thoughts and suggestions on the monetary policies. Through the research, it proves that the choice of money supply as an intermediary target is effective, but there is a certain lag in regulating consumption inflation. Meanwhile, it shows that there is a policy contradiction between the employment rate and the inflation rate.

T2  - Proceedings of the International Conference on Business Excellence
AB  - Abstract
Official statistics and usual metrics place Romania at a relatively low level of unemployment. This paper shows why this can be misleading, considering various specificities of the Romanian economy. Looking at such factors as structural features, a high number of people employed in agriculture, involuntary part-time workers, etc. we show that there are alternative metrics for unemployment that can constitute better diagnostic tools for public policies and labor market reform. The alternative unemployment metrics presented here, show that the real unemployment figures in Romania are much closer to those in Mediterranean economies like Greece, Italy, and Spain that have been struggling with high unemployment. Furthermore, we emphasize possible directions and measures to be implemented in Romania to reduce unemployment (especially structural) and to support inter-regional social cohesion and sustainable economic growth. Given the current context of the economic downturn in the post-COVID-19 and the projected impact on vulnerable groups and the risk of poverty, it is more important than ever to develop sound evidence for the policy-making process.

AB  - Why were European economies able to pursue the simultaneous commitment to full employment and welfare state expansion during the first decades of the postwar period and why did this virtuous relationship break down during recent decades? This book provides an answer to this question, by highlighting the critical importance of a political exchange between unions and governments, premised on wage moderation in exchange for the expansion of social services and transfers. The strategies pursued by these actors in these political exchanges are influenced by existing wage bargaining institutions, the character of monetary policy and by the level and composition of social policy transfers. The book demonstrates that the gradual growth in the fiscal burden has undermined the effectiveness of this political exchange, lowering the ability of unions' wage policies to affect employment outcomes.

The traditional modeling of the association between the unemployment rate and monetary policy variables represented by the money supply, as well as the Johansen model of joint integration, were used to test the study's hypothesis. Long-term correlations were identified between fiscal policy, real public expenditures, real public revenues, and unemployment. The unemployment rate cannot be influenced by short-term monetary and financial policies. Our plan calls for domestic and international investment mechanisms to be activated through better coordination of monetary and financial policies as well as increased efficiency in these areas. the aims of the two policies.

T2  - SSRN Electronic Journal
AB  - Using a VAR model of the American economy from 1984 to 2003 we find that, contrary to official claims, the Federal Reserve does not target inflation or react to “inflation signals.” Rather, the Fed reacts to the very “real” signal sent by unemployment; in a way that suggests that a baseless fear of full employment is a principal force behind monetary policy. Tests of variations in the workings of a Taylor Rule, using dummy variable regressions, on data going back to 1969 suggest that after 1983 the Federal Reserve largely ceased reacting to inflation or high unemployment, but continued to react when unemployment fell “too low.” We further find that monetary policy (measured by the yield curve) has significant causal impact on pay inequality–a domain where the Federal Reserve refuses responsibility. Finally, we test whether Federal Reserve policy has exhibited a pattern of partisan bias in presidential election years, with results that suggest the presence of such bias, after controlling for the effects of inflation and unemployment.

AB  - Expectations have had a prominent role in macroeconomics ever since the publication of Keynes’s General Theory. In that book, the word ‘expectation’ appeared in the title of two chapters, and the concept was used throughout. Expectations were central to the determination of both the interest rate and the level of investment and the trade cycle in the longer run. This is most clearly illustrated in chapter 5, ‘Expectation as determining output and employment’, where Keynes identifies the importance of expectations in determining the level of employment: ‘To-day’s employment can be correctly described as being governed by to-day’s expectations taken in conjunction with to-day’s capital equipment’ (1936 [1973], p. 50).

T2  - Monetary Policy and Unemployment
AB  - The literature relating movements in unemployment and activity distinguishes between three main hypotheses. The first—the natural rate hypothesis—states that, although output-gap fluctuations generate cyclical movements in unemployment, in the long run, unemployment reverts back to equilibrium. This equilibrium is determined by deep, structural factors such as taxation, work incentives, unionization, social preferences etc. The second hypothesis—Hysteresis—suggests that unemployment has no such equilibrium-reversion properties: due to institutional and labor market rigidities, cyclical fluctuations can have permanent effects on the level of unemployment. There are two coexisting approaches to this hypothesis, one simply implying that unemployment is characterized as a nonstationary unit-root process. The other one emphasizes the possible nonlinearity involved in the formation of the equilibrium unemployment, the complexity of which is not simply captured by a unit-root process.1 In the former case, the unemployment follows a random walk, reflecting all types of shocks cumulated over history; in the latter, unemployment may be affected solely by shocks of large magnitude, moreover in an asymmetric way

AU  - Keyserling, Leon H.
T2  - Policy Studies Journal
AB  - During 1953 through 1979 estimated, the U.S. economy has exhibited a roller-coaster economic performance–six periods of inadequate upturn, stagnation, and recession, with a chronic rise in unemployment because each upturn at its peak has tended to leave us with more unemployment than the previous one. During the period as a whole, we have forfeited 7.1 trillion 1978 dollars in GNP and 80.8 million years of civilian employment opportunities, and consequently lost about 1.8 trillion dollars in public revenues at all levels, with severe neglect of national priorities, and chronically rising Federal Budget deficits. This sorry record is due primarily to reliance upon a “trade-off” between unemployment and inflation. But empirical evidence for more than a quarter century has demonstrated that inflation rises as unused capabilities increase and vice versa. The annual inflation rate during the first half of 1979 exceeded 13 percent despite recession; it ranged from 1.6–3.0 percent during periods close to full employment. We now need thorough reconstruction of national economic policies, including abandonment of (1) the unemployment-inflation “trade-off,” (2) attempts to balance the federal budget at the expense of the economy and the people, (3) the prevalent monetary policy with soaring interest rates, and (4) excessive reliance on tax reductions in lieu of increased public outlays or investment. These changes would replace improvised and frequently conflicting national economic policies with comprehensive and coherent efforts. All this is in accord with the Humphrey-Hawkins Full Employment and Balanced Growth Act of 1978

Our approach is motivated by empirical studies of monetary policy effects and is semiparametric in the sense that we model the process determining the distribution of treatment—the policy propensity score—but leave the model for outcomes unspecified. A conceptual innovation is that we adapt the cross-sectional potential outcomes framework to a time series setting. We also develop root-T consistent distribution-free inference methods for full conditional independence testing, appropriate for dependent data and allowing for first-step estimation of the (multinomial) propensity score.

Taking intoconsideration these aspects, we aim to present a theoretical and empirical view on therelationship between inflation and unemployment in this study. Also, our intention is toanalyze if in Romania, during 1990 and 2009, there is a Phillips type relation between theinflation rate and the unemployment rate.

An increase in government spending of 1 percent of GDP generates output and unemployment multipliers, respectively, of about 1.2 percent (at one year) and 0.6 percentage points (at the peak). Each percentage point increase in GDP produces an increase in employment of about 1.3 million jobs. Total hours, employment and the job finding probability all rise, whereas the separation rate falls. A standard neoclassical model augmented with search and matching frictions in the labor market largely fails in reproducing the size of the output multiplier whereas it can produce a realistic unemployment multiplier but only under a special parameterization. Extending the model to strengthen the complementarity in preferences, to include unemployment benefits, real wage rigidity and/or debt financing with distortionary taxation only worsens the picture. New Keynesian features only marginally magnify the size of the multipliers. When complementarity is coupled with price stickiness, however, the magnification effect can be large.

AB  - The difference in unemployment rates between the U.S. and Europe is well documented. In this paper we develop a simple model with frictional labour, goods and credit markets to understand the extent to which difference in unemployment rates across the U.S. and Europe can be explained by differences in income tax rate, unemployment benefits, monetary policy, and financial liberalizations. Our quantitative analysis shows that among these four factors, labour income taxes is the leading cause of the observed cross-country difference in unemployment rates, followed by unemployment benefits and financial liberalizations. Monetary policy is not a contributing factor to the comparatively high unemployment in Europe.

AB  - After reaching the effective lower bound for the federal funds rate in late 2008, the Federal Reserve turned to two unconventional policy tools -- quantitative easing and increasingly explicit and forward-leaning guidance for the future path of the federal funds rate -- in order to provide additional monetary policy accommodation. We use survey data from the Blue Chip Economic Indicators to infer changes in private-sector perceptions of the implicit interest rate rule that the Federal Reserve would use following liftoff from the effective lower bound. Using our estimates of the changes over time in private expectations for the implicit policy rule, and estimates of the effects of the Federal Reserve's quantitative easing programs on term premiums derived from other studies, we simulate the FRB/US model to assess the actual economic stimulus provided by unconventional policy since early 2009. Our analysis suggests that the net stimulus to real activity and inflation was limited by the gradual nature of the changes in policy expectations and term premium effects, as well as by a persistent belief on the part of the public that the pace of recovery would be much faster than proved to be the case. Our analysis implies that the peak unemployment effect -- subtracting 1¼ percentage points from the unemployment rate relative to what would have occurred in the absence of the unconventional policy actions -- does not occur until early 2015, while the peak inflation effect -- adding ½ percentage point to the inflation rate -- is not anticipated until early 2016.
