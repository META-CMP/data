AU  - Di Maggio, Marco

AB  - Do households benefit from expansionary monetary policy? We investigate how indebted households' consumption and saving decisions are affected by anticipated changes in monthly interest payments. We focus on borrowers with adjustable rate mortgages originated between 2005 and 2007 featuring an automatic reset of the interest rate after five years. The monthly payment due from the average borrower falls by 52 percent ($900) upon reset, resulting in an increase in disposable income totaling tens of thousands of dollars over the remaining life of the mortgage. We uncover three patterns. First, the average household increases monthly car purchases by 40 percent ($150) upon reset. Second, this expansionary effect is attenuated by the borrowers' voluntary deleveraging, as a significant fraction of the increased income is deployed to accelerate debt repayment. Third, the marginal propensity to consume is significantly higher for low income borrowers and for those that had experienced a larger decline in housing wealth. To complement these household-level findings, we employ county-level data to provide evidence that consumption responded more to a reduction in short-term interest rates in counties with a larger fraction of adjustable rate mortgage debt. Our results shed light on the income channel of monetary policy as well as the role of debt rigidity in reducing the effectiveness of monetary policy.

AB  - The interconnection between asset prices, inflation and unemployment has been central to the recent macroeconomic modelling of economic reforms in emerging market economies. In this paper we examine how effects of economic reforms are critically sensitive to interconnection between variety of real variables and monetary variables in terms of a dependent economy model consisting of a traded sector and a non-traded sector. The model has two necessary ingredients. One is slow adjustment in nominal wage in the sense that wage is rigid in the short run but changes overtime in response to short run unemployment. The second one is adjustment in asset price namely Tobin's q. The paper shows that both trade liberalization and capital account liberalization may generate short run unemployment. Moreover, the paper discusses macroeconomic implications of both fiscal policy and monetary policy.

TI  - The impact of inflation targeting on unemployment in developing and emerging economies
AU  - Divino, Jose Angelo
AB  - Several countries around the world have adopted the inflation targeting regime for monetary policy. Despite the growing literature on the issue, it is not clear whether developing and emerging countries can improve their economic performance by adopting inflation targeting. This working paper examines the extent to which macroeconomic policies anchored to inflation targeting affect unemployment, economic growth and the output gap. The results show that inflation targeting causes no harm to employment in developing and emerging countries. On the contrary, it might reduce average unemployment and narrow the output gap. Given that the change in regime must be accompanied by institutional and economic reforms to fiscal and exchange rate policies, targeters might be better off than non-targeters. Hence there is no apparent reason to condemn the adoption of the inflation targeting regime by developing and emerging countries.

TI  - High Unemployment in the OECD: Does the Diagnosis of the 1980s Apply to the 1990s?
AU  - Carey, Kevin
AB  - Measures of job market rigidities in OECD economies for the 1980s do a very poor job of explaining changes in unemployment since the last recession in 1993. By contrast, changes in unemployment since 1993 are positively correlated with initial inflation, even when controlling for the change in inflation during that time. The result can be interpreted as saying that the expected change in inflation between 1993 and 1996 was positively related to the level of 1993 inflation. This can explain why unemployment has failed to fall in certain economies even when disinflation has not been severe. The effect is plausibly attributable to intending EMU participants.

TI  - Asymmetric unemployment uctuations and monetary policy trade-os
AU  - Lepetit, Antoine
AB  - I show that a trade-o between ination volatility and average unemployment arises in a New Keynesian model with search and matching frictions in the labor market. In this environment, unemployment rises more and faster in a recession than it decreases in an expansion. A monetary authority focused solely on stabilizing ination exacerbates labor market volatility and leads to higher average unemployment. When the model is calibrated to the U.S. economy, the welfare gains of adopting the optimal policy rather than a policy of price stability are found to be substantial. Moreover, the bulk of those welfare gains arises from the increase in mean employment achieved by the Ramsey policymaker. This result points to the importance of the asymmetric nature of unemployment uctuations in shaping monetary policy trade-os. The introduction of imperfect unemployment insurance does not change the results in a signicant way.

AB  - Unemployment is one of the major sources of misery in our society. When people record their sense of well-being, it is found that being unemployed makes a person much more unhappy than being poor.2 So a civilized society should not tolerate our present levels of unemployment. The European Unions member governments have called for unemployment to be reduced to 5 per cent. Is it possible? If we seriously want a big cut in unemployment, we should focus sharply on those policies which stand a good chance of having a really big effect. It is not true that all policies which are good in general are good for unemployment. There are in fact very few policies where the evidence points to any large unambiguous effect on unemployment and I list in Annex 1 some widely advocated policies for which there is little clear evidence.

AB  - The UKs stagflation in the 1970s is decomposed into its causative factors, using the Liverpool rational expectations model. It is found that there was a large rise in the natural rate of unemployment, mainly due to rising union density; that fiscal and monetary shocks had little effect on the resulting rise in unemployment; and the high inflation of the period was due to persistent and large fiscal deficits, with their accompanying monetization. Mrs Thatcher inherited an inflation induced by an ongoing deficit and a natural rate of over 2 million unemployed.

According to the results, in the short run, unemployment responds mostly to the unanticipated shocks of the monetary policy rule in the United States and the supply shocks. Inﬂation also responds to this rule and the impulses associated with aggregate demand. In the long run, unemployment is declining, and inﬂation is accelerating mainly in the face of an unanticipated expansion of U.S. monetary policy caused by the establishment of the Taylor rule.

T2  - Monetary Policy and Unemployment
AB  - The statistical examination of the links between labor market institutions and unemployment across developed countries is a relatively recent development, pioneered by Stephen Nickell and his colleagues (Layard et al. 1991; Nickell and Bell 1995; Nickell and Layard 1997). Chapter 5 by Blanchard and Wolfers in this volume, previously published as an NBER working paper in 1999 and in the Economic Journal in 2000, has been a hugely influential contribution in what might be termed the second generation of research on this question. It focuses on the interaction of macroeconomic shocks and institutions, expands the time period, and adds time-varying measures of institutions. But most importantly it is cautious—persistently checking the initial results with various robustness tests and questioning the meaningfulness of the regression results given the quality and potential endogeneity of the key institutional measures. I will begin with a brief overview of what may be termed the “first generation” studies, followed by short comments on the Blanchard-Wolfers contribution, and then will turn to more recent work that challenges the mainstream view that cross-country regression research confirms a central role for labor market institutions in the explanation for Europe’s high unemployment in the 1980s and 1990s.

AU  - Eng, Yoke-Kee
AU  - Chin-Yoong
AB  - The present paper attempts to examine if unemployment rates in Southeast Asia demonstrate hysteresis, and to find out the propagation mechanism at work. By using the standard Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) test, Schmidt and Phillips, and Lee and Strazicich LM unit root test respectively without and with structural breaks, we found that our sampled countries exhibit no hysteresis in unemployment rates, except for Singapore. With a dynamic optimizing model we inferred that hysteresis in unemployment can be induced by monetary policy. Given the weight on actual inflation stabilization, countries that implement policy feedback rule that assigns greater weight on output gap stabilization, in effect, respond to both actual and expected inflation rates. Such a policy stance that over emphasizes both actual and expected inflationary threats will lead to inflation persistence, which in turn, causes unemployment persistence as the real wage is unable to adjust to equilibrate the labor market. How policy is conducted, be it cold-turkey or gradualism approach, is also responsible for the existence of hysteretic unemployment.

AB  - Taking into account two salient Spanish stylized facts, namely, a persistent
disinflationary process and hysteresis in the unemployment, this paper tries to answer
the following question: Is a nominal permanent disinflation compatible with short-run
unemployment costs but also with long-run output benefits? The answer to this
question crucially depends on the way we identify such nominal shocks. When
monetary shocks are identified as those that do not generate a long-run trade-off
between inflation and unemployment (and inflation in the long-run is primarily,
although not exclusively, a monetary phenomenon), the answer to the question is yes.
The reason is that, although in the data there exists a permanent trade-off between
inflation and unemployment, its origin is real.

AB  - The unemployment rate in the euro area appears to contain a significant nonstationary component, suggesting that some shocks have permanent effects on that variable. I explore possible sources of this nonstationarity through the lens of a New Keynesian model with unemployment, and assess their empirical relevance.

AB  - Demographic forces have profoundly shaped the dynamics of U.S. labor force participation and unemployment over the past forty years. Recognizing the importance of these employment indicators for the conduct of monetary policy, this Economic Brief  explores how they have been influenced by the U.S. population's changing gender, educational, and age profile. Based on the authors' estimates, the trend U.S. unemployment rate will decline to 4.3 percent over the next ten years as the population continues to age and increase its educational attainment.

T2  - Melbourne Institute working paper series; 03,22
AB  - This paper summarises a large project involving many studies to evaluate the effects on
employment and unemployment in Australia of macroeconomic, wage restraint, taxation and
social security systems, and of education and training policies. One set of studies finds that
the NAIRU is an uncertain estimated number, others suggest a number or a range of long
term equilibrium unemployment rates, and by implication the lower bound to achievable noninflationary unemployment rate is uncertain. Simulations with the TRYM, MONASH and
VAR models find that stimulatory macroeconomic policies and wage restraint policies
increase employment in the short run. Simulations with the MITTS and VAR models, and
comparisons of employment experiences across countries, find that changes in tax and social
security systems, as they alter incentives, affect labour supply and job search decisions, and
employment.

TI  - Problems of Interaction between Aggregate Demand, Inflation and Unemployment - ProQuest
AB  - Current economy, without exception, recorded fluctuations in the general level of economic activity,
represented generally by gross domestic product (GDP). The development trend illustrates a hypothetical
dynamic of economy, drawn by joining the points that would be a constant evolution of the economy over
a period of time, or, in other words, provide an estimate of potential output developments in labor
productivity that economy could achieve in conditions of full employment of labor. The economy is
typically located above or below the trend.In order to study this evolution, the science of macroeconomics
uses a number of concepts or phrases such as "economic cycle", "business cycle", "cyclical fluctuations"
and so on, between the fundamental variables whose components or sign up demand or aggregate
expenditure, inflation and unemployment, which interact in a specific way. Cyclical unemployment is
accompanied by underutilization of labor resources and incomplete use of plant and equipment. This is
illustrated by an indication of the capacity utilization in the manufacturer's economy. Economy bear a cost
when resources capital and labor are incomplete used. Production that could have been achieved with
these productive resources is the opportunity cost of cyclical unemployment, and can be very high.
Aggregate expenditure is total expenditure households, firms, government and external sector made for
goods and services produced in the economy. Change affects costs of production and income, and their
dynamics exert further effects on spending. Economies are constantly affected by various shocks, such
as financial crises, rising oil prices, large fluctuations in the budget deficit, the explosion of transactions on
the stock exchange, new technologies that affect entire sectors of the economy. There are, in fact,
complexes of factors that have the potential to generate recession or expansion. In the face of these
shocks, policy makers must ensure the potential savings in trying to keep inflation rates low and stable.
The authors are concerned to highlight different aspects of the interaction between the three variables
during significant phases of deployment cycle.

AB  - Has the inflation target band impacted the natural rate of unemployment (NAIRU) in South Africa based on the accelerationist Philips curve? Furthermore, to what extent can the expansionary monetary policy impact the unemployment rate above the NAIRU when using the 4.5 per cent inflation threshold? Evidence in this chapter suggests that monetary policy has a role to play in dealing with the unemployment problem above the NAIRU. This is contrary to evidence put forward that there is little or nothing that monetary policymakers can do. We find that price stability measured by inflation bands of inflation below 6 per cent leads to a lower NAIRU compared to when the inflation bands are not considered. Expansionary monetary policy lowers the unemployment rate above the NAIRU. Evidence shows that expansionary monetary policy lowers the unemployment rate and these effects are amplified by high GDP growth, investment growth, credit growth, the exchange rate appreciation and unit labour costs below the trend growth (alternatively, positive labour productivity shocks). However, the impact of expansionary monetary policy on the unemployment rate above the NAIRU is hampered by the exchange rate depreciation and high unit labour costs above the trend growth. This evidence shows that studies which do not control for the influence of inflation bands miss an important aspect in the determination of the NAIRU in South Africa. Such findings can lead to policymakers dismissing certain important policy tools which are also potent in lowering the unemployment rate.

TI  - QE and Unemployment: A Financial Friction DSGE Model with LSAPs and Labor Market Search
AU  - Song, Xuetao
AB  - In response to the disruption of credit markets and the zero lower bound during the recent financial crisis, the Federal Reserve introduced a variety of new policy tools. Perhaps, the most visible of these tools is large scale asset purchases (LSAP) programs, often referred to as "quantitative easing" (QE). Among the policy objectives, unemployment rate is a crucial target to the central bank. However, exactly which factors could account for the impact of QE programs on unemployment has yet to be resolved. Also, agreement on the effectiveness of QE has stimulated the economic recovery is far from universal. This paper is to have a financial friction DSGE model with labor market search to assess the impact of regime switching between conventional and unconventional monetary policy on aggregate economic activity, especially on labor market, and to evaluate the effect of QE policy on the unemployment rate during the recent recession. The paper reveals channels through which the credit policy shocks transmit to labor market and the impacts of financial shock is amplified. The paper finds that bond purchasing policy has stronger effect on labor market and the security purchase policy creates more volatility to the unemployment rate. Both policies have effective short-run effect yet ineffective even negative long-run effect. Also, timing effects of asset purchase policy reactions are different.

TI  - The nexus between monetary policy and unemployment in Poland in the view of New Neoclassical Synthesis
AU  - Włodarczyk, Przemysław
AB  - The purpose of presented dissertation is the determination of mechanisms responsible for the existence of a nexus between monetary policy and unemployment in the light of the New Neoclassical Synthesis (NNS) and verification of their significance for the situation observed in Polish economy in 2000-2018 period. The analyses are performed in four stages. The first of them attempts at systematization of the achievements of existing economic theory with respect to the  nexus between monetary policy and unemployment. The second presents monetary policy and unemployment in a standard DSGE framework. The final two parts approach the problem from an empirical perspective using both the statistical methods and purposefully built and developed econometric models. Finally, some postulates concerning desirable monetary policy are formulated.
The analyses provided meaningful results. It was proven that monetary policy is a viable instrument that might be used in order to increase the level of output produced in Polish economy and alleviate the labour market performance when the unemployment rate is relatively high. It was also noticed that the use of expansive monetary policy for the purposes of business cycle support comes at a cost of rising inflation. As a result, expansive monetary policy should never be used in a consecutive manner, but rather as a short-run, transitory source of economic stimulation, so as to fulfil the definition of a temporary shock. The results of performed welfare analysis which proved that unemployment rate augmented Taylor rule outperformed any other combination of variables enabled us to go even a step further and to recommend that if the monetary policy is performed according to the strict guidance given by a corresponding rule and its ultimate aim is the maximisation of social welfare, understood as stabilisation of consumption at its steady state level, then simultaneous inflation and unemployment rates' targeting should comprise the best possible guidance for the purpose of monetary policy execution in an analysed small open economy.

macroeconomic and monetary variables. The method used in this study is the first to estimate NAIRU using the Ball-Mankiw
approach and to estimate the relationship between NAIRU and Inflation using VECM. The results of this study indicate that in
the mechanism of monetary policy transmission of the interest rate path when using alternative NAIRU objectives, it is evident
that Inflation and NAIRU have a tradeoff in both the short and long term.

The analysis is based on the impacts of using technological systems and data generalization in the macroeconomic and monetary framework. Thus, we included variables that capture the evolution of gross domestic product, inflation, interest rate, unemployment, monetary and wage index which are the determinants of the capacity to absorb the structural funds and also the outcome indicators for use of these funds. The interest rate channel has gained consistency in recent years, which facilitates enhancing the absorption of structural funds.

AB  - Monetary policy makers are uncertain about the state of the economy and learn from the economy's reaction to policy. Private agents, however, anticipate any systematic attempt to incorporate this information into future policy. We analyze this feedback in the context of a monetary authority's attempt to stimulate an economy in recession. We show that modest stimuli may prove ineffectual. If small reductions in interest rates are unlikely to promote a response, then they may be followed by further cuts. A vicious circle develops in which the expectation that the policy could fail leads investors to delay investment thereby promoting failure.

AB  - The difference in unemployment rates between the U.S. and Europe is well documented. In this paper, we develop a model with frictional labor, goods and credit markets to understand how differences in unemployment rates across the U.S. and Europe can be explained by differences in income tax rate, unemployment benefits, monetary policy, and credit market imperfections. Using data between 2001 and 2007, our quantitative analysis shows that among these four factors, labor income taxes is the leading cause of the observed cross-country difference in unemployment rates,followed by unemployment benefits and credit market frictions. Monetary policy is not a contributing factor to the comparatively high unemployment in Europe.

AB  - This paper compares the effects of conventional monetary policy on real borrowing costs with those of the unconventional measures employed after the target federal funds rate hit the zero lower bound (ZLB). For the ZLB period, we identify two policy surprises: changes in the two-year Treasury yield around policy announcements and changes in the ten-year Treasury yield that are orthogonal to those in the two-year yield. The efficacy of unconventional policy in lowering real borrowing costs is comparable to that of conventional policy, in that it implies a complete pass-through of policy-induced movements in Treasury yields to comparable-maturity private yields.

The problem of effective ECB monetary policy is very important during crisis times. Unemployment is the factor that is under jurisdiction of ECB since 2011 using inflation targeting. The main instrument we use for defining the influence of ECB policy is the OLS method. The time period from 2000 till 2015 is considered. Our findings show that the influence of inflation on unemployment in all countries apart from Austria is terribly low. Other factors, such as labor productivity and foreign direct investments inflow have a greater influence on unemployment.

AB  - This lecture examines monetary policy during the past three decades. It documents two contrasting eras: first a Rules-Based Era from 1985 to 2003 and second an Ad Hoc Era from 2003 to the present. During the Rules-Based Era, monetary policy, in broad terms, followed a predictable systemic approach, and economic performance was generally good. During the Ad Hoc Era, monetary policy is best described as a “discretion of authorities” approach, and economic performance was decidedly poor. By considering alternative explanations of this policy–performance correlation and examining corroborating evidence, the lecture concludes that rules-based policies have clear advantages over discretion.

AB  - This study examines how unemployment rate dynamically responds to shocks to consumer confidence, business confidence, inflation and monetary policy.  Based on the vector autoregressive (VAR) analysis of the monthly data from 1978:M2 to 2012:M5, the results show that unemployment negatively responds to shocks to consumer confidence and business confidence. While consumer confidence is not responsive to FED interest rate shock, business confidence negatively responds to FED fund interest rate shock. The results also show consumer confidence and business confidence Granger-cause unemployment, and inflation Granger-causes consumer confidence. However, inflation and Fed Fund interest rate do not Granger-cause unemployment movement.  For the 12-month horizon, the unemployment forecast error is 71% due to its own shock, 11% due to consumer confidence shock, 13% due to business confidence shock, 1.10% due to inflation shock, and 3% due to Fed Fund interest rate shock.

T2  - The European Journal of the History of Economic Thought
AB  - This note examines A. C. Pigou's views on the practical issue of high unemployment in the 1920s. In his Industrial Fluctuations, Pigou emphasized that the monetary aspect of business cycles was much more important to fluctuations in unemployment than wage adjustment. In a journal article, however, he stated that major part of the high unemployment should be attributed to the failure of money wage adjustment. I argue that, on balance, Pigou attached greater importance to monetary problems than to the wage rigidity.

AB  - Among the working-age population, one of the most damaging individual experiences is
unemployment. Mostly it is a serious issue in third world countries like SriLlanka. The main aim of this
study is to identifies the nature of the unemployment and its impact on individual‘s well-being among
the working age group with respect to their vocational activities such as income, savings housing
,health, education and other social welfare in Jaffna District in Sri Lanka. The primary data were
collected from 100 unemployed households in Jaffna District by using structured questionnaire. The
techniques such as descriptive statistics such as descriptive and regression model were used in this
study. The results of the regression model indicate that the unemployment negatively affecting in all
economic and social conditions of the people in Jaffna District. Finally the overall results reveal that
among unemployed people, non-pecuniary factor such as job prospects, health and social relations –
show significant effects on individual well-being, along with their income. Policy makers have to take
necessary actions incorporating strategic approaches which can reduce the unemployment and improve
the well-being of the people in Jaffna District, Sri Lanka. Specially government have to consider this
main economic problem in its future changes of monetary and fiscal policy.

TI  - NONLINEARITY IN THE IMPACT OF INFLATION TARGETING ON UNEMPLOYMENT
AU  - Thula, Maleka Chirwa
AB  - Motivated by the controversy surrounding the effects of inflation targeting on economic
performance, this paper assesses the impact of inflation targeting on unemployment and further
explores whether the level of unemployment and financial development matter in determining the
impact of inflation targeting on unemployment. To approach this issue, we utilise cross sectional
data covering the period of 1990 to 2010 from 68 inflation targeting and non-targeting countries.
The results show that inflation targeting has nonlinear effects on unemployment. On one
hand, inflation targeting reduces unemployment, particularly for countries with higher
unemployment rates. On the other hand, the beneficial effect of inflation targeting on
unemployment is moderated by financial deepening.

T2  - Studia Universitatis Babes Bolyai - Negotia
AB  - Current macroeconomic theories examine the problem of unemployment rate from the aggregate demand point of view. Rising unemployment is always seen as a sign of the weak economy, where is a slow growth and also little spending. These might trigger actions by authorities to help reduce unemployment, by increasing the nation&#39;s money supply, so it can boost the economy. Among the factors that influence (un-)employment, at least two very important should be taken in consideration: exchange rate and inflation. The research aims to analyse the impact of inflation, the RON / EURO exchange rate and the financial crisis on unemployment rate in Romania during January 1997- March 2019.

AB  - This paper examines the validity of the political business cycle theory as a description of the macroeconomic policy process in the United States. It considers the ability of incumbent presidents to enhance their approval ratings by manipulating monetary and fiscal tools. The first section estimates the potential political gains from economic expansion and finds that the stimulus needed to produce even small popularity gains is substantial. The second section examines the extent to which government economic policy has been influenced by the political environment. Reaction functions for various policy instruments are estimated, and the results are shown to cast substantial doubt on the importance of the political business cycle hypothesis as an explanation of macroeconomic policy.

TI  - The International Disequilibrium System
AU  - Mundell, Robert A.
T2  - Kyklos
AB  - Most of the important generalizations of international trade theory that owe their origin to the classical school are long-run and static in nature, implicitly assuming that disequilibrium is a transitory state and that passage between equilibria is untroubled. Yet past experience seems to indicate that external disequilibria can remain for extended periods of time, and that the modern system is a disequilibrium system. The nature of the international disequilibrium system has sometimes been attributed, erroneously, to the Keynesian foreign-trade-multiplier theorem that an increase in exports will induce an increase in imports which is smaller than the initial increase in exports, and this has been the origin of the belief that “HUME'S law” is invalid in the case of saving and unemployment. However, HUME'S law is valid even in this case if gold flows are allowed to have their natural effect on the internal money supply and hence on interest rates, investment and incomes. HUME'S law is therefore valid in the case of Keynesian unemployment, although the price-specie-flow mechanism is replaced by an income-specie-flow process. The true nature of the international disequilibrium system derives from the fact that central banks do not allow externally-induced gold flows to affect the internal supply of money since that would conflict with the new primary goal of monetary policy; full employmentwithout inflation. The new function of monetary policy leaves a policy vacuum with respect to the balance of payments, except insofar as ad hoc policies are designed to suit special circumstances. Gold flows are therefore automatically neutralized by open market operations in some countries, while in other countries monetary policy in effect cancels or reinforces the monetary effect of gold flows in the pursuit of internal stability. At critical times, when foreign exchange reserves become dangerously low and subject to speculation, or when they become burdensomely high, action by the authorities must be introduced even if this is at the expense of internal stability. Even in these cases, however, the system need not become an equilibrium system since the objective might be to recoup reserves or allow them to run down.

TI  - Zero Is Not the Optimal Rate of Inflation
AU  - Palley, Thomas
T2  - Challenge
AB  - Monetary policy and interest rates remain at center stage of the economic policy debate.
During the last recession, the question was how fast and how low should the Federal
Reserve lower interest rates. Now that the unemployment rate has fallen to a twenty three
year low of 4.8%, the question has quickly become how high the Fed should raise rates.
 Many economists adhere to the notion of a "natural" rate of unemployment (about
which more below), and this notion is driving much of the current debate. Federal Reserve
Chairman Alan Greenspan recently referred to the laws of supply and demand having not
been repealed, and argued that increased inflation is inevitable if the economy continues on
its current course. Behind this reference lies a belief in a natural rate of unemployment,
itself determined by supply and demand in the labor market.
 Side-by-side with this belief, many economists (including most at the Fed) also claim
that optimal monetary policy should aim for zero inflation. However, the claim that this is
optimal is inconsistent with the theory of a natural rate of unemployment. In effect, there is
a slip betwixt the cup of theory and the lip of policy. How are we to explain this slippage,
and what really is the optimal rate of inflation?

TI  - Credibility and the credit channel transmission of monetary policy theoretical model and econometric analysis for Brazil
AU  - Caldas Montes, Gabriel

T2  - Journal of Economic Studies
AB  - Purpose – The purpose of this paper is to present a theoretical model and empirically verifies the transmission of monetary policy through the credit channel in Brazil. The study verifies if the monetary policy, the economic activity and the maturity of the inflation targeting regime affect the supply of credit. Design/methodology/approach – The paper offers a review of the literature concerning inflation targeting credibility and the transmission mechanism of monetary policy through the credit channel, it develops a theoretical model based on Bernanke and Blinder and Ferreira and it seeks empirical evidence for the Brazilian economy using ordinary least squares, generalized method of moments and vector autoregressive. Findings – The estimates indicate that the supply of credit is stimulated when the economy heats up, when the monetary authority reduces the interest rate and when the credibility increases. The evidence also indicate that the supply of credit is affected by the variables of the model, economic activity and employment are affected by monetary policy and the supply of credit exerts influence on both employment and output gap. Research limitations/implications – An important implication of this study is that, in inflation targeting emerging economies, such as that of Brazil, following a committed monetary policy to price stability which increases the credibility of the regime of inflation targeting and promoting macroeconomic stability represents a good strategy for improving the volume of lending to the private sector, thus stimulating economic activity and employment. What the findings do indicate is that developing credibility is crucial for emerging economies that are trying to grow, but with inflation being kept under control. Originality/value – The paper presents the following theoretical and empirical contributions: the model incorporates the effect that the credibility of the inflation targeting regime has on the supply of credit and, the econometric approach provides evidence that the monetary policy, the economic activity and the process of anchoring of inflation expectations affect the supply of credit in Brazil. Moreover, the paper finds evidence that the credit channel acts as a transmission mechanism of monetary policy to the economy.

TI  - What Drives US Inflation and Unemployment in the Long Run?
AB  - There is a growing consensus on the existence of a positive, long-run relation between inflation and unemployment in the US economy. However, the conclusion that the two variables move in the same direction at low frequencies leaves open the question of the identification of the factors - real or, alternatively, monetary - underlying this co-movement. In this paper we try to shed light on this question by adopting a structural VAR agnostic approach. The main conclusion is that in the postwar US economy an important role has been played by supply shocks in shaping the long-run evolution of unemployment. Thus, it seems that this evidence is at odds with purely monetary explanation of the co-movement between inflation and unemployment.

AB  - We study the eﬀects of the ﬁrm’s credit condition on labor market performance and the relationship between expected inﬂation and unemployment in a new monetarist model. Better credit condition has a positive impact on the labor market as ﬁrms save on ﬁnancing cost, improve proﬁtability, and create more vacancies. Inﬂation aﬀects unemployment through two opposing channels. First, inﬂation increases the ﬁrm’s ﬁnancing cost, which discourages job creation and increases unemployment. Second, inﬂation lowers wages because unemployed workers carry higher real balances and suﬀer more from inﬂation compared to unemployed workers. This encourages job creation. The overall eﬀect of inﬂation on employment can be positive or negative and depends crucially on the ﬁrm’s credit condition. We calibrate the model to match U.S. data before the great recession. The calibrated model suggests a small welfare cost of inﬂation and a downward-sloping Phillips curve with a ﬂexible wage setting. We ﬁnd that the ﬁrm’s credit condition is as important as the nominal interest rate to understand the unemployment movement.

The interaction between inflation and unemployment is shown by model based on three first-order differential i.e. difference equations: Phillips relation, adaptive expectations equation and monetary-policy equation. The resulting equation is second order differential i.e. difference equation which describes the time path of inflation. The data of the rate of inflation and the rate of unemployment are used for parameters estimation. On the basis of the estimated time paths, the stability and convergence analysis is done for the rate of inflation.

AB  - In this paper a brief history of the Phillips curve is sketched. Empirical evidence from France, Germany, the United Kingdom and the United States during the latter half of the 20th century in support of a positive long-run relationship between price inflation and unemployment is presented. In order to reconcile the predominant theoretical view, which holds that inflation is neutral in the long run, with the observed data, two arguments are outlined, both of which build on unintended consequences of monetary expansion: (1) redistributional effects on incomes and wealth, and (2) business cycle fluctuations. The analysis hinges on further political interventions in response to these consequences, which tend to increase unemployment as they render labor markets less flexible. In this sense the relationship between price inflation and unemployment over the past 60 years can in part be interpreted as the outcome of an interventionist spiral.

AU  - Blanchard, Olivier J.

AB  - The obvious lesson from the Great Financial Crisis is that the financial system matters and financial crises will probably happen again. The second, more general, lesson is that the economy is often not self-stabilizing. These two lessons, together with an environment where neutral interest rates are likely to remain low, have clear implications for the design of stabilization policies. At a minimum, they suggest that policies may need to become more aggressive, both ex-ante and ex-post, with a rebalancing of the roles of monetary, fiscal and financial policies. In particular, while low neutral rates decrease the scope for using monetary policy, they increase the scope for using fiscal policy. Think of such rebalancing as evolution. If however, neutral rates become even lower, or financial regulation turns out to be insufficient to prevent crises, more dramatic measures, including larger fiscal deficits, revised monetary policy targets, or sharper restrictions on the financial system, may be needed. Think of this as revolution. Time will tell.

A2  - Havrilesky, Thomas
AB  - This Chapter employs the index of monetary policy signaling from the Administration to the Federal Reserve (SAFER) that was developed in Chapter Two. The SAFER index is a simple weekly sum of articles that appeared in the Wall Street Journal in which Administration officials expressed a desire for easier (+1) or tighter (−1) monetary policy. A key assumption is that systematically over time the financial media capture the essence of communication that is going on between the executive branch and Federal Reserve officials.1 The signaling index is employed in ordinary least squares regressions for the period from January 1964 to November 1991. Cumulative values of the SAFER index over a three-week period, as an explanatory variable, are found to have a statistically significant effect on the average Federal funds rate during the third week, as the dependent variable. Further evidence suggests that the SAFER index is Granger-causal with respect to the Federal funds rate. After classifying the signals by sources within the Administration (Oval Office, Council of Economic Advisers, Treasury and other and unidentified sources), it is shown that, for the overall 1964–1991 period, signals from the Treasury Department and from other and unidentified sources have a statistically significant effect on the Federal funds rate while signals from the Oval Office and the Council do not. When the data are segmented according to who was the Chairman of the Federal Reserve Board at the time ordinary least squares results indicate that the Federal Reserve did not systematically respond to executive branch signaling in a statistically significant way when William McChesney Martin, G. William Miller, and Alan Greenspan were Chairmen but did respond statistically significantly to Administration signaling during portions of the periods during which Arthur Burns and Paul Volcker were Chairmen.

TI  - Macroeconomic Causes of Unemployment: Diagnosis and Policy Recommendations /: Makroökonomische Ursachen der Arbeitslosigkeit: Diagnose und Therapievorschläge
AU  - Filc, Wolfgang
AU  - Köhler, Claus
AB  - This conference volume deals with one of the most severe economic, social and political problems major European economies face since the early nineties, the problem of lasting high unemployment. Contrary to the current German discussion, solely concentrating on microeconomic explanations and therapy recommendations, this volume presents papers based on various macro-economic points of view, showing different ways out of the employment crisis. Apart from renowned German economists, some well-known international academics participated in the 1998 Berlin symposium, to learn from experience in other countries.The first chapter contains the main standard textbook models and paradigms explaining lasting high unemployment. The question in the second chapter is if it is possible to fight unemployment with the help of macro policy on a purely national basis in the presence of global markets. The third chapter indicates possible effects of misalignments in financial markets on economic growth and employment. The contributions of the fourth chapter present experiences of other countries, which have succeeded in recent years in lowering their unemployment rates. The question at issue is, if these concepts can be transferred to Germany. The topics of the concluding chapter are practical macroeconomic starting points for sustainable employment growth in Europe. The methods contradict supply side arguments for the stabilisation of employment predominant in the German discussion. Attention is focused on relations between the role of monetary and fiscal policy in close conjunction with wage policy. Furthermore it is made evident that in global markets a theoretical macroeconomic concept as a base for sustainable employment is not very promising without enhanced international co-operation.

TI  - Cyclical long-term unemployment, skill loss, and monetary policy
AU  - Kienzler, Daniel
AB  - Movements in long-term unemployment (LTU) exhibit a substantial cyclical component. I document a number of stylized facts and develop a business cycle model featuring labor market frictions and skill loss during unemployment to reproduce the ﬁndings in the data. I ﬁnd that the skill loss mechanism helps to capture volatility patterns across macroeconomic variables, negative duration dependence, and the behavior of the LTU proportion among total unemployment around business cycle turning points. Optimal monetary policy in the presence of skill loss allows for a higher volatility of inﬂation after productivity shocks to reduce skill deterioration and mitigate consumption losses.

AB  - We provide evidence on the relative importance of cyclical and structural factors in explaining unemployment, including the sharp rise in U.S. long-term unemployment during the Great Recession of 2007–09. About 75 % of the forecast error variance of unemployment is accounted for by cyclical factors—real GDP changes (“Okun’s Law”) and monetary and fiscal policies. Structural factors, which we measure using the dispersion of industry-level stock returns, account for the remaining 25 %. For long-term unemployment the split between cyclical and structural factors is closer to 60–40, including during the Great Recession. Examination of the industry-level stock returns suggests that adverse shocks to the construction sector and, to a lesser extent, the finance sector were responsible for the increase in structural unemployment. The Great Recession appears similar to the recession of 1973–75, as sectoral shocks played a large role at that time as well.

AB  - Pour comprendre les causes de l'écart de taux de chômage entre le Canada et les États-Unis, il est nécessaire d'examiner les facteurs qui touchent tous deux l'offre et la demande. Selon cette étude, malgré le resserrement récent, l'assurance-chômage demeure un facteur majeur pour expliquer le taux de chômage plus élevé au Canada. Cette étude prétend que la conduite récente des politiques économiques dépend fortement de ce qui a été fait dans le passé. Par exemple, le resserrement de la politique fiscale, qui a pu affecter le chômage, était inévitable, à cause de la croissance de la dette qui s'est produite au cours des deux dernières décennies, et qui est très coûteuse pour l'économie. L'étude conclut qu'ily a encore beaucoup d'aspects de la question qui ne sont pas bien comprises, et pour cette raison nous recommandons une poursuite de la recherche sur le sujet. /// Understanding the causes of the Canada-US unemployment rate gap necessitates examining both supply and demand factors. The paper argues that, despite recent tightening, unemployment insurance remains a major factor in explaining the higher Canadian unemployment rate. On the policy front, the paper argues the importance of state-dependence: the recent conduct of policies heavily depends upon what was done in the past. For example, fiscal tightening, which could have influenced unemployment, was unavoidable because of the build-up of debt over the past two decades, which is very costly to the economy. The paper concludes that there is still a lot on this subject that is not well understood and recommends continued research in this area.

TI  - The relationship between inflation and unemployment
AU  - Govera, Hemish
AB  - The nature of the relationship between inflation and unemployment has implications for the appropriate
conduct of monetary policy. However, the question as to whether the traditional Phillips
curve relationship holds true remains debatable despite advances in both theoretical and empirical
evidence. This study revisits this debate for South Africa by examining data on unemployment,
the repo interest rate and core CPI for the period from 1994Q1 to 2015Q4. This was in the light of
recent developments in both theoretical and empirical Phillips curve literature. The research
employed a hybrid version of the NKPC and various econometric techniques. The Augmented
Dickey-Fuller test was used to examine the unit root properties of the data series. The Johansen
cointegration technique was applied to test for cointegration among the variables. The research
derived and estimated an error correction model for inflation. The model results demonstrated that
the repo interest rate is statistically significant in explaining inflation. The VECM was derived and
estimated to examine both short-run and long-run relationships among the variables. The results
confirmed the existence of a positive but insignificant long-run relationship between unemployment
and inflation. The study used the Granger causality test to ascertain the nature of causality
among the variables. The research established the presence of unidirectional Granger causality
running from core CPI to unemployment. Forecast error variance decomposition shows that large
percentages of variations in each variable are attributable to each variable respectively. The
empirical findings are helpful to the understanding of the Phillips curve relationship in South
Africa and emerging economies in general.

TI  - Do Unemployment and Inflation Substantially Affect Economic Growth?

T2  - Journal of Economics and Development Studies
AB  - Unemployment and inflation are persistently complex and alarming problems to every economy. These twin macroeconomic variables are significant in influencing economic growth especially in developing economies. Thus, the aim of this study is to examine how unemployment and inflation substantially affect economic growth. To achieve this, three models were thoroughly subjected to quantitative analysis, namely; Ordinary Least Square (OLS) method, Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) technique and Granger causality test. The result of the regression revealed that the coefficient of inflation is positive and statistically significant while unemployment is positive but has no significant effect on economic growth. This proves that inflation substantially affect economic growth, although unemployment has little substantial effect on it. Moreover, result of the unit root indicates that all the variables in the model are stationary whereas, the result of causality test suggests that unemployment does not granger causes economic growth and inflation, but economic growth and inflation Granger cause unemployment, also there exist Granger causality between economic growth and inflation. Therefore, the result suggests a one-way causation flowing from inflation to GDP. Consequently, the major policy implication of these results is that concerted efforts should be made by policy makers towards restructuring the economy, managing price instability and improving infrastructure.

TI  - Unexpected Effects: Uncertainty, Unemployment, and Inflation
AU  - Freund, Lukas
AU  - Rendahl, Pontus
AB  - This paper studies the role of uncertainty in a search-and-matching framework with risk-averse households. A mean-preserving spread to future productivity contracts current economic activity even in the absence of nominal rigidities, although the effect is reinforced by the presence of the latter. That is, uncertainty shocks carry both contractionary demand- and supply effects. The reason is that a more uncertain future increases the precautionary behavior of households, which reduces interest rates and contracts demand. At the same time, as future asset prices becomes more volatile and positively covary with aggregate consumption, households demand a larger risk premium, which puts negative pressure on current asset values and thereby contracts supply. Thus, in comparison to a pure negative demand shock, an uncertainty shock puts less deflationary pressure on the economy and, as a result, renders a flatter Phillips curve.

TI  - Inflation pressure and European unemployment
AU  - Carey, Kevin
T2  - Applied Economics Letters
AB  - While the recent failure of unemployment to fall in many OECD economies is often attributed to labour market rigidities, there is a strong cross–sectional correlation between changes in unemployment since the last recession and changes in inflation over the same period (1993–1997). Furthermore, this linkage is dominated by the influence of initial (i.e. 1993) inflation. This can be interpreted in terms of two effects: countries with higher 1993 inflation had less scope for relaxation of monetary policy, and may have experienced larger increases in expected inflation. These inflation pressure effects in turn are related to the EMU inflation convergence criteria.

T2  - NBER Macroeconomics Annual
AB  - Using a simple case study approach, this paper compares the conduct and performance of monetary policy in six industrialized countries since the breakup of the Bretton Woods system. Our purpose is to develop fruitful hypotheses that might usefully be explored in subsequent, more formal research. From a positive perspective, a frequently observed pattern in the case studies is that central banks adopt money growth targets when inflation threatens to get out of control. Central banks appear to use money growth targets both as guideposts for assessing the stance of policy and as a means of signaling their intentions to the public; however, no central bank adheres strictly to targets in the short run. More normatively, the case studies also suggest that money growth targets might be useful in providing a medium-term framework for monetary policy, if the targeting is done in a clear and straightforward manner and if targets can be adjusted for changes in the link between target and goal variables. It appears that rigid adherence to money growth targets in the short run is not necessary to gain some benefits of targeting, as long as there is some commitment by the central bank ultimately to reverse short-term deviations from target. Finally, the choice of operating procedure seems to have little bearing on the success of policy.

AU  - Mikosch, Heiner

T2  - European Journal of Political Economy
AB  - Grüner (2010) argues that the introduction of the European Monetary Union (EMU) led to lower wage growth and lower unemployment in participating countries. According to Grüner, monetary centralization increases the amplitude of national business cycles, which leads to higher unemployment risk. In order to counter-balance this effect, trade unions lower their claims for wage mark-ups, resulting in lower wage growth and lower unemployment. This paper uses macroeconomic data on OECD countries and a difference-in-differences approach to empirically test the implications of this model. Although we come up with some weak evidence for increased business cycle amplitudes within the EMU, we neither find a significant general effect of the EMU on wage growth nor on unemployment.

AB  - Using household survey data for the U.S. and the U.K., we show that the aggregate response of consumption to interest rate changes is driven by households with a mortgage. Outright home-owners do not adjust expenditure at all while renters change their spending but by less than mortgagors. Income rises for all households as interest rate cuts directly affect firm investment and household consumption, boosting aggregate demand. A crucial difference between the housing tenure groups is the composition of their balance sheets: mortgagors hold sizable illiquid assets but little liquid wealth. Our results reveal that general equilibrium effects on household income coupled with balance-sheet-driven heterogeneity in the marginal propensity to consume play a key role in the transmission of monetary policy.

AB  - A system dynamics model of the national economy is now being assembled. Preliminary studies show that the production sectors can generate three different modes of fluctuation in the economy similar to the 3-to-7-year business cycle, the 15-to-25-year Kuznets cycle, and the 45-to-60-year Kondratieff cycle. These several modes arise from the basic physical processes of production and the managerial policies governing inventory, employment, and capital investment. The three modes of economic fluctuation are easily confused, and have tended to be interpreted as if they belonged only to the business cycle, perhaps leading to inappropriate policies. The work is still in progress, but results to date have important implications for many areas, including capital investment and its effect on the business cycle, monetary policy, fine tuning the economy, the severity of future recessions, the Phillips curve, factors affecting unemployment, and the trade-off between unemployment and inflation.

AB  - We develop a New-Monetarist model of unemployment in which distributional considerations matter. Households who lack commitment are subject to both employment and expenditure risk. They selfinsure by accumulating real balances and, possibly, claims on ﬁrms proﬁts. The distribution of liquidity is endogenous and responds to idiosyncratic risks and monetary policy. Despite the ex-post heterogeneity our model can be solved in closed form in a variety of cases. We show the existence of an aggregate demand channel according to which the distribution of workers across employment states, and their incomes in those states, aﬀects the distribution of liquid wealth and ﬁrms’ proﬁts. An increase in unemployment beneﬁts or wages has a positive eﬀect on aggregate demand and can lead to higher employment. Moreover, an increase in productivity has a multiplier eﬀect on ﬁrms’ revenue.

We show that unanticipated changes in expectations display large and persistent effects on the unemployment rate in the 2007–09 downturn, contributing to maintain unemployment high well after the most recent recession. We also find that the changes in the autocorrelation of the unemployment rate and its correlation with inflation generated by unanticipated changes in unemployment expectations help to rationalize the pattern observed in the data in the post-1990 recessions.
