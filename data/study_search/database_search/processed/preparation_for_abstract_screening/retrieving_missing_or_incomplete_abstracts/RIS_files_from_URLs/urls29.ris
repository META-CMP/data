T3  - Rules and Discretion in Monetary Policy
AB  - In October 1992, following sterling's departure from the Exchange Rate Mechanism, Britain adopted a new framework for monetary policy. That comprised two components: first, an explicit target for inflation, and, second, institutional changes designed to give greater influence to the Bank of England by increasing the transparency and openness of the process by which interest rates are set. This paper analyses those changes from the perspective of the debate on rules versus discretion, and argues that an appropriate design of institutional arrangements can provide incentives for central bankers to pursue the first-best state-contingent monetary policy.

TI  - Improving Unemployment Rate Forecasts Using Survey Data
AU  - Österholm, Pär
AB  - This paper investigates whether forecasts of the Swedish unemployment rate can be
improved by using business or household survey data. We conduct a simulated outof-sample forecast exercise in which the performance of a Bayesian VAR model with
only macroeconomic variables is compared to that when the model also includes
variables based on survey data. Results show that the forecasting performance at
short horizons can be improved. The improvement is largest when forward-looking
variables based on data from the manufacturing industry are employed. (JEL: E17,

AB  - Abstract: This study examines the long run relation between interest rate spread and unemployment rates of OECD countries over the period of 2005 and 2016. When explaining unemployment rate, we used some important financial variables such as long-term interest rates, money supply of M1 and stock exchange index beside spread. First, a cointegration method is used to discover the long run movement. Second, ARDL estimation method is used to see relation between the variables in the long term. We found out that all explanatory variables are cointegrated with unemployment rates; the effect of spread on unemployment rate seems to be significant and has positive relation in the long run. Further, there is also meaningful relation between unemployment rate,money supply of M1, long term interest rates and stock exchange index. Öz: Bu çalışma 2005 ve 2016 döneminde OECD ülkelerinde kredi ve mevduat faiz oranları farkının(faiz oranı dağılımının) işsizlik oranları üzerindeki uzun dönemli ilişkisini incelemektedir. İşsizlik oranının açıklanmasında uzun dönem faiz oranları, para arzı (M1) ve borsa indeksi gibi finansal değişkenler kullanılmıştır. İlk olarak, eştümleşim yöntemiyle uzun dönemli hareketler incelenmiş, ikinci olarak ARDL (Gecikmesi Dağıtılmış Ardışık Bağlanım) tahmin metodu ile değişkenler arasındaki uzun dönemli ilişkiler ele alınmıştır. Tüm açıklayıcı değişkenlerin işsizlik oranı ile eştümleşik olduğu görülmüştür. Faiz oranı dağılımının işsizlik oranı ile uzun dönemli önemli bir ilişki içinde olduğu saptanmıştır. Yine, işsizlik oranı, para arzı, uzun dönem faiz oranları ve borsa indeksi arasında anlamlı bir ilişkinin varlığına işaret edilmektedir.

AB  - We consider a model with frictional unemployment and staggered wage bargaining where hours worked are negotiated every period. The workers' bargaining power in the hours negotiation affects both unemployment volatility and inflation persistence. The closer to zero this parameter, (i) the more firms adjust on the intensive margin, reducing employment volatility, (ii) the lower the effective workers' bargaining power for wages and (iii) the more important the hourly wage in the marginal cost determination. This set-up produces realistic labor market statistics together with inflation persistence. Distinguishing the probability to bargain the wage of the existing and the new jobs, we show that the intensive margin helps reduce the new entrants wage rigidity required to match observed unemployment volatility. Nous considérons un modèle avec chômage frictionnel et des négociations salariales échelonnées où les heures travaillées sont négociées à chaque période. Le pouvoir de négociation des travailleurs lors de la négociation des heures affecte la volatilité du chômage et la persistance de l'inflation. Plus ce pouvoir de négociation est proche de zéro, (i) plus les entreprises utilisent la marge intensive, ce qui réduit la volatilité de l'emploi, (ii) plus le pouvoir de négociation des travailleurs lors des négociations salariales est faible, et (iii) plus le salaire horaire est important dans la détermination du coût marginal du travail. Ce modèle engendre des statistiques réalistes concernant le marché du travail et la persistance de l'inflation. La séparation des probabilités de négocier le salaire des emplois existants et nouveaux permet de montrer que la marge intensive contribue à réduire la rigidité des salaires pour les travailleurs nouvellement embauchés, afin de reproduire la volatilité observée du taux de chômage.

AU  - Altig, David

T2  - Handbook of Monetary Policy
AB  - The connection between unemployment and gross domestic product growth is often formally summarized by the statistical relationship known as “Okun’s law.” As developed by the late economist Arthur M. Okun in 1962, the “law” related decreases in the unemployment rate to increases in output growth. Although Okun’s law expresses a relationship between changes in the unemployment rate and output growth, it is more appropriate to think of it as a “rule of thumb,” as it was intended, rather than as an immutable law derived from theory. The reason that the association between the unemployment rate and output is relatively strong is that changes in the unemployment rate are related to changes in the other factors that affect output growth. Productivity changes are only slightly correlated with changes in the unemployment rate, and the variability of these changes is large—roughly two-thirds of the variability of output.

TI  - The effect of the exchange rate regime on unemployment and GDP.
AU  - El-Helou, Majed
AB  - The issue to be examined is whether flexible exchange rates result in less variability in GDP and unemployment rates. Basically, with a fixed exchange rate governments cannot allow the exchange rate to fluctuate in response to external shocks to the economy, nor are they as able to use monetary and/or fiscal policy to respond to external shocks. Since an external shock cannot be accommodated by a nominal change in the exchange rate or through monetary policy, such shocks must be accommodated by changes in real economic activity, i.e., changes in GDP and unemployment. With a flexible exchange rate, an external shock can be accommodated by a change in the exchange rate, or through monetary and/or fiscal policy and should thus have less impact on unemployment and GDP. This hypothesis is theoretically studied and explained more widely in the thesis and is tested with the data available.

AB  - This paper has focused on the extent to which the traditional tools of macroeconomic management in the United States, monetary and fiscal policy, have contributed to a political business cycle. Regardless of whether politicians can successfully influence real economic variables to their own ends, the evidence presented here suggests that they tried, and that they enjoyed some at least indirect aid from their ‘independent’ monetary authorities in doing so. Several major conclusions emerge.

Our findings show that the relative welfare cost of unemployment versus inflation is higher than one, and much higher in intermediate age cohorts and in low job protection countries. The potential role of our findings in explaining the heterogeneous behaviour of CBs under different job market settings is discussed and compared with alternative explanations based on other institutional or structural differences in economies and in their reactions to shocks.

AB  - We develop a search-theoretic model of inflation and unemployment where money plays an essential role to mitigate a double coincidence of wants problem between workers and firms. At the steady state, the effects of inflation are similar to those of a proportional tax on wages : it reduces the surplus of a match and affects the way this sur-plus is shared. In general, the long-run Phillips curve slops upward, i.e., steady state unemployment increases with inflation. Equilibrium unemployment is generically inefficient. When it is too high, the Fried-man rule is the optimal monetary policy. When it is too low, a devi-ation from the Friedman rule is optimal. We describe the transitional dynamics and consider several extensions of the model.

AB  - Lesotho’s unemployment, poverty and income inequality and other social ills remain pervasive in the face of non-inclusive growth. Using structural vector autoregressive framework and annual time series data spanning from 1980 to 2014, this paper investigates the sources of the high unemployment in Lesotho, a small landlocked developing country whose currency is pegged to that of South Africa. The impulse response functions, forecast error variance decomposition and historical decomposition jointly revealed that unemployment dynamics in Lesotho largely emanate from shocks to employment, unemployment itself, productivity, real wages and inflation. The importance of positive shocks to employment and unemployment itself in explaining unemployment variations decline over time while the importance of positive shocks to productivity, real wages and inflation grow with time. In light of this, Lesotho’s government should promote private sector development, diversify the economy’s markets and invest in human and physical capital development with a view to increase employment.

AU  - Liu, Yuelin
AB  - This paper develops a New Keynesian model with search frictions in which generated frictional unemployment is consistent with the time series of involuntary unemployment collected by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. Thus, it can shed light on the relevant impact of labor market frictions and policy interventions on the observed unemployment about which policy makers and the public are concerned. The data-consistent unemployment is achieved in the model via introduction of partial consumption insurance and an endogenous labor force participation channel. In particular, I find that allowing for endogenous labor force participation greatly improves the model fit for U.S. data. It appears that the price markup shock and matching efficiency shock are the two key driving forces of unemployment  fluctuations. Monetary policy that stabilizes the participation gap can be welfare improving.

AB  - We study how employment documentation requirements and out-of-pocket closing costs constrain mortgage refinancing. These frictions, which bind most severely during recessions, may significantly inhibit monetary policy pass-through. To study their effects on refinancing, we exploit a Federal Housing Administration policy change that excluded unemployed borrowers from refinancing and increased others' out-of-pocket costs substantially. These changes dramatically reduced refinancing rates, particularly among the likely unemployed and those facing new out-of-pocket costs. Our results imply that unemployed and liquidity-constrained borrowers have a high latent demand for refinancing. Cyclical variation in these factors may therefore affect both the aggregate and distributional consequences of monetary policy.

TI  - Macroeconomic Theory: A Dynamic General Equilibrium Approach - Second Edition
AU  - Wickens, Michael
AB  - The definitive graduate textbook on modern macroeconomicsMacroeconomic Theory is the most up-to-date graduate-level macroeconomics textbook available today. This revised second edition emphasizes the general equilibrium character of macroeconomics to explain effects across the whole economy while taking into account recent research in the field. It is the perfect resource for students and researchers seeking coverage of the most current developments in macroeconomics.Michael Wickens lays out the core ideas of modern macroeconomics and its links with finance. He presents the simplest general equilibrium macroeconomic model for a closed economy, and then gradually develops a comprehensive model of the open economy. Every important topic is covered, including growth, business cycles, fiscal policy, taxation and debt finance, current account sustainability, and exchange-rate determination. There is also an up-to-date account of monetary policy through inflation targeting. Wickens addresses the interrelationships between macroeconomics and modern finance and shows how they affect stock, bond, and foreign-exchange markets. In this edition, he also examines issues raised by the most recent financial crisis, and two new chapters explore banks, financial intermediation, and unconventional monetary policy, as well as modern theories of unemployment. There is new material in most other chapters, including macrofinance models and inflation targeting when there are supply shocks. While the mathematics in the book is rigorous, the fundamental concepts presented make the text self-contained and easy to use. Accessible, comprehensive, and wide-ranging, Macroeconomic Theory is the standard book on the subject for students and economists.The most up-to-date graduate macroeconomics textbook available todayGeneral equilibrium macroeconomics and the latest advances covered fully and completelyTwo new chapters investigate banking and monetary policy, and unemploymentAddresses questions raised by the recent financial crisisWeb-based exercises with answersExtensive mathematical appendix for at-a-glance easy referenceThis book has been adopted as a textbook at the following universities:American UniversityBentley CollegeBrandeis UniversityBrigham Young UniversityCalifornia Lutheran UniversityCalifornia State University - SacramentoCardiff UniversityCarleton UniversityColorado CollegeFordham UniversityLondon Metropolitan UniversityNew York UniversityNortheastern UniversityOhio University - Main CampusSan Diego State UniversitySt. Cloud State UniversityState University Of New York - Amherst CampusState University Of New York - Buffalo North CampusTemple University - MainTexas Tech UniversityUniversity of AlbertaUniversity Of Notre DameUniversity Of OttawaUniversity Of PittsburghUniversity Of South Florida - TampaUniversity Of TennesseeUniversity Of Texas At DallasUniversity Of WashingtonUniversity of Western OntarioWesleyan UniversityWestern Nevada Community College

TI  - An Alternative Explanation for the “Fed Information Effect”
AU  - Bauer, Michael
AU  - Swanson, Eric T.
AB  - High-frequency changes in interest rates around FOMC announcements are a standard method of measuring monetary policy shocks. However, some recent studies have documented puzzling effects of these shocks on private-sector forecasts of GDP, unemployment, or inflation that are opposite in sign to what standard macroeconomic models would predict. This evidence has been viewed as supportive of a “Fed information effect” channel of monetary policy, whereby an FOMC tightening (easing) communicates that the economy is stronger (weaker) than the public had expected. We show that these empirical results are also consistent with a “Fed response to news” channel, in which incoming, publicly available economic news causes both the Fed to change monetary policy and the private sector to revise its forecasts. We provide substantial new evidence that distinguishes between these two channels and strongly favors the latter; for example, (i) regressions that include the previously omitted public economic news, (ii) a new survey that we conduct of Blue Chip forecasters, and (iii) high-frequency financial market responses to FOMC announcements all indicate that the Fed and private sector are simply responding to the same public news, and that there is little if any role for a “Fed information effect”.

AB  - This paper studies the impact effect of monetary policy shocks on the exchange rate in Australia, Canada, and New Zealand during the 1990s. Shocks are identified by the reaction of three month market interest rates to policy announcements that were not themselves endogenous to economic news on the same day. The main result is that a 100 basis point contractionary shock will appreciate the exchange rate by 2–3 percent on impact. The association of interest rate hikes with depreciations that is sometimes observed during periods of exchange market pressure is mainly attributable to reverse causality.

AB  - This chapter investigates the links between unemployment rates in a group of OECD economies and their institutions, for the period 1960–89. Institutions govern behaviour, and so are among the most fundamental determinants of how, and how well, an economy functions. By governing economic behaviour, they shape economic mechanisms, and through them influence the effectiveness of economic policy, placing constraints on the policy choices available to governments. Institutions also reflect the social preferences which influence the goals that governments pursue. The focus here is on the extent to which institutional differences can explain differences in unemployment rates, both over time and among countries.

AB  - During the financial crisis, monetary policy was loosened significantly. Debate continues about the extent to which low interest rates and quantitative easing (QE) may have had adverse distributional impacts, whether by income, wealth, age or region. Using quantified simulations on micro data, I show that looser monetary policy had a significantly positive financial impact on the majority of cohorts of UK society. The impact of monetary policy loosening on income and wealth inequality was small and the overall impact on household welfare significantly positive. These results differ from public perceptions of monetary policy. Personalised information on the impact of monetary policy on household balance sheets could help to correct these misperceptions.

AB  - This paper examines the transmission mechanism of monetary policy in India. Considering the external constraints on monetary policy, it estimates a series of vector autoregression models to examine the effects of an unanticipated monetary policy tightening on the real sector. The empirical results suggest that the lending rate initially increases in response to a monetary tightening. Banks play an important role in the transmission of monetary policy shocks to the real sector.

T2  - Journal of Economics and Development Studies
AB  - The main objective of this paper is to empirically examine the impact of macroeconomic policy and stock market behavior in Nigeria. Broad Money, Interest Rate, Government Expenditure, Tax Revenue and Gross Domestic Product have been chosen as indicators of macroeconomic policy while stock prices are used to represent stock market behavior. The Methodology used is the ARDL bounds testing approach. The empirical findings show that money supply and interest rate have statistically significant effects on the stock market in the short and the long run. Similarly, government spending and taxation have statistically significant effects on the stock market in the short and the long run. This therefore, suggests that macroeconomic policy actions have significant effects on the stock market in Nigeria both in the short and the long run. Considering that the main channel of such influence is primarily through the monetary and fiscal operations it becomes necessary the authorities to employ fiscal and monetary policy in tandem rather than in isolation in order to realize the full potentials of the stock market activities in the countries.

TI  - Monetary Policy Transmission in India: A Peep Inside the Black Box
AU  - Khundrakpam, Jeevan Kumar

AB  - Using SVAR models on quarterly data for 1996-97:1 to 2011-12:1, the paper examines the relative importance of various transmission channels of monetary policy to GDP growth and inflation in India. It finds that external exogenous factors prolong the impact of monetary policy transmission on GDP growth and inflation in India, while removing the problem of ‘price puzzle’. Among the various channels of transmission, interest rate channel, credit channel and asset prices channel are found to be important, while exchange rate channel is weak. A positive shock to policy rate leads to slowdown in credit growth with a lag of two quarters and subsequently impacts GDP growth and inflation negatively. The same monetary policy shock has a negative impact on asset prices from the third quarter onwards and, in turn, has a pronounced negative impact on GDP growth and inflation. Exchange rate channel is found to have an insignificant impact on GDP growth, but has non-negligible impact on inflation. Interest rate channel is found to account for about half of the total impact of monetary shocks on GDP growth and about one-third of the total impact on inflation, indicating that interest rate channel is the most important channel for monetary policy transmission in India.

AB  - This paper uncovers Taylor rules from estimated monetary policy reactions using a structural VAR on U.S. data from 1959 to 2009. These Taylor rules reveal the dynamic nature of policy responses to different structural shocks. We find that U.S. monetary policy has been far more responsive over time to demand shocks than to supply shocks, and more aggressive toward inflation than output growth. Our estimated dynamic policy coefficients characterize the style of policy as a "bang-bang" control for the pre-1979 period and as a gradual control for the post-1979 period.

AB  - In this paper, we examine the impact of monetary policy shocks to the real economy by investigating the effects on different regions. Annual data for GDP, employment and investment from 12 regions in Greece are used for the period 1980 to 2009. By using an unrestricted VAR model and the impulse response analysis our results show that an interest rate shock affects the economic activity across regions differently. Furthermore in our investigation, we use a dynamic PANEL VAR model so as to investigate the dynamic variation of the impact of interest rates controlling also for time and cross regions fixed effects associated with specific time invariant regions' characteristics as well as with time variant characteristics attributed to the integration process of these regions. Therefore, these findings are very important to policy makers.

The paper suggests that in the run-up to the 2008 crisis, the European Central Bank's low interest rate policy affected the allocation of resources across industries. This may explain the sluggish overall recovery from the crisis in Europe.

AB  - We find evidence of a bank lending channel operating in the euro area via bank risk. Financial innovation and the wider use of new ways of transferring credit risk have tended to diminish the informational content of standard bank balance sheet indicators. We show that bank risk conditions, as perceived by financial market investors, need to be considered, together with the other indicators (i.e., size, liquidity and capitalization), traditionally used in the bank lending channel literature to assess banks’ ability and willingness to supply new loans. Using a large sample of European banks, we find that banks characterized by lower expected default frequency are able to offer a larger amount of credit and to better insulate their loan supply from monetary policy changes.

AB  - This study examined the relationship between monetary policy and gross domestic product (GDP)
in Malaysia for quarterly data from 1991 Q1 to 2011 Q4. According to Unit Root test, monetary policy variables
M1, M2, M3 and GDP were stationary only at first difference and however, real interest rate was at level and
first difference for data stationary. Then, Johansson co-integration analysis and vector error correction method
(VECM) were applied of the study. The result showed that there was a possibility of existence of long-run
equilibrium relationship between GDP with M1, M2, M3 and real interest rate. Results of trace and maximum
Eigen-value method indicated that there were also 2 co-integration equations at the 0.05 level significant.
Results of VECM analysis showed that M1, M2, M3 as a monetary supply variable are statistically significant
in the GDP model. Therefore, monetary supply instruments had long-term influences on GDP and also there was
positive relationship between money supply and GDP in Malaysia.

T2  - Ecological Economics
AB  - The rate of interest – the price of money – is said to be a key policy tool. Economics has in general emphasised prices. This theoretical bias results from the axiomatic-deductive methodology centring on equilibrium. Without equilibrium, quantity constraints are more important than prices in determining market outcomes. In disequilibrium, interest rates should be far less useful as policy variable, and economics should be more concerned with quantities (including resource constraints). To investigate, we test the received belief that lower interest rates result in higher growth and higher rates result in lower growth. Examining the relationship between 3-month and 10-year benchmark rates and nominal GDP growth over half a century in four of the five largest economies we find that interest rates follow GDP growth and are consistently positively correlated with growth. If policy-makers really aimed at setting rates consistent with a recovery, they would need to raise them. We conclude that conventional monetary policy as operated by central banks for the past half-century is fundamentally flawed. Policy-makers had better focus on the quantity variables that cause growth.

(i) The effects of monetary policy shocks are U shaped over the income distribution—that is, expansionary shocks increase the incomes of high- and low-income individuals relative to middle-income individuals. (ii) The large effects in the bottom are accounted for by the labor-income response and (iii) those in the top by the capital-income response. (iv) The heterogeneity in the labor-income response is due to the earnings heterogeneity channel, whereas (v) that in the capital-income response is due to the income composition channel.

T2  - Economic Modelling
AB  - We study the changing international transmission of U.S. monetary policy shocks to 14 OECD countries over the period 1981Q1–2010Q4. The U.S. monetary policy shock is defined as unexpected change in Effective Federal Funds Rate (FFR). We use a time varying parameter factor augmented VAR approach (TVP-FAVAR) to study the EFFR shocks together with a large data set of 265, major financial, macroeconomic and trade variables for U.S., Canada, France, Germany, Italy, UK, Japan, Australia, Spain, Norway, Sweden, Switzerland, Finland and New Zealand. Our main findings are as follows. First, negative U.S. monetary policy shocks have considerable negative impact on GDP growth in the U.S., Canada, Japan and Sweden while most of the other member countries benefits. Second, the transmission to GDP growth has increased in OECD countries since the early 1980s. We also detect a more depressed GDP over medium term in the U.S., Canada, Japan, Australia, Norway and Sweden over the recent global financial crisis. Third, the size of U.S. monetary policy shocks during financial turmoil periods were unusual than normal periods and varies overtime. The financial crisis (2008–2009) is evidenced by decline in residential investment in the U.S. and propagation of this shock to Canada, Germany, Japan, Switzerland and New Zealand over the recent period. U.S. monetary policy shocks reduce share prices in most of the OECD countries; this impact is more pronounced over the turmoil period. Asset prices, interest rates and trade channel seem to play major role in propagation of monetary policy shocks.

AU  - Hsing, Yu
T2  - Brazilian Electronic Journal of Economics
AB  - This article employs the VAR model to estimate the impacts of government debt, monetary policy, exchange rates, and other selected macroeconomic variables on real GDP in Brazil. Using the money market rate as a policy tool, the impulse response function indicates that in the long run, a shock to the real money market rate, external debt, or domestic debt has a negative impact on output and that a shock to budget deficit, currency depreciation, or stock market performance has a positive effect on output. Variance decomposition of output shows that the lagged output is the most influential variable and can explain up to 69.98% of the variation in real output in Brazil. External debt is the second most important variable and can explain up to 33.34% of output fluctuations. Up to 22.24% of output variance is attributable to the real interest rate. When real monetary base is considered as a monetary tool, the response of output to government deficit is negative, and the stock market can explain more output variance. Hence, the selection of different monetary policy instruments may yield different empirical results for some of the impulse-response relationships.

AB  - This paper focuses on Swiss GDP revisions and the uncertainty they generate from the point of view of monetary policy. After a description of the revisions features, we use GDP vintages to compute real-time output gaps using a production function approach. Then, with a nominal feedback rule, we assess the impact of GDP – and hence output gap – on revisions monetary policy. The main results are threefold. First, Swiss GDP revisions – similarly to those of other small economies – are large, and estimates converge slowly to their final value. Second, GDP mismeasurements clearly exacerbate the difficulty in estimating output gaps. Third, the impact of revisions on monetary policy varies over time. Via its effect on output gaps, ceteris paribus, the inaccuracy of GDP estimates risks introducing a procyclical bias in monetary policy decisions.

AB  - We study the monetary-transmission mechanism with a data set that includes quarterly observations of every insured U.S. commercial bank from 1976 to 1993. We find that the impact of monetary policy on lending is stronger for banks with less liquid balance sheets--i.e., banks with lower ratios of securities to assets. Moreover, this pattern is largely attributable to the smaller banks, those in the bottom 95 percent of the size distribution. Our results support the existence of a "bank lending channel" of monetary transmission, though they do not allow us to make precise statements about its quantitative importance.

AB  - This study examines the effect of monetary policy instruments on unemployment in Nigeria (1986-2018) using secondary data from Statistical bulletin of Central Bank of Nigeria(2020)Specific objectives of the study is to find out the effect of monetary policy rate, broad money supply, exchange rate, liquidity ratio and cash reserve ratio on unemployment. The study adopted an Autoregressive Distributed Lag technique and also conducted the unit root and co-integration test. The study found that cash reserve ratio and monetary policy rate had positive and insignificant effect on the employment rate in Nigeria, broad money supply had positive and significant effect on the employment rate in Nigeria, exchange rate and liquidity ratio had negative and significant effect on the employment rate in Nigeria. The study concludes that monetary policy has significant effect on the rate of unemployment. Based on the findings made in the course of this study, the study recommends that the Monetary policies should be used to create a favourable investment climate by facilitating the emerging of market based interest rate and exchange rate administration that will attract both domestic and foreign investments and create jobs, Government should build an effective and sustained low interest rate intervention fund to support the real sector, especially small and medium enterprises. Hence, it is recommended that policy makers in Nigeria should focus invariably on the adjustment of interest rate when considering unemployment in its monetary policy decisions.

AB  - In this work, the effectiveness of monetary policy and its transmission channels are analyzed before and after the 2007 economic crisis in the United States and the Eurozone by using a VAR model. We find that, in the United States, monetary policy before and after the crisis have been effective, with special emphasis on the “risk channel”. In the Eurozone, monetary policy was also effective before the crisis, being transmitted through the “credit channel”. Once the crisis erupted, unconventional monetary policy remained effective only at the start of the crisis; the risk channel then became the effective transmission mechanism.

AB  - Using quarterly data for the Federal Republic of Germany, we generate four-quarter-ahead forecasts for real GDP growth. Throughout the 1970s and 1980s, other monetary indicators like real M1 or short-run interest rates clearly outperform forecasts which are based on interest rate spreads. This holds for within as well as for ex-post predictions. The same holds for the development after 1992. Moreover, it is shown that simple forecasts based on M1 or on short-run interest rates outperform the common biannual GNP forecasts of the group of German economic research institutes.

T2  - Global Economic Review
AB  - Unlike most studies on the effect of monetary policy on bank lending, this article intends to answer the question whether the tightening of monetary policy in Malaysia before and after the financial crisis in 1997 affected differently the commercial bank lending to various sectors of the economy. To achieve the objective, Vector Autoregressive Regression (VAR) method was used to generate impulse response function and variance decomposition to trace the impact of a shock in monetary policy on bank lending in Malaysia. The results show that a monetary policy tightening in Malaysia gives a negative impact on all the sectors. Analyzing sectoral responses to monetary shocks, evidence is found that some sectors are more affected than the others. The manufacturing, agricultural, and mining sector seems to decline more than the aggregate bank lending in response to interest rate shock.

AB  - We revisit the results in Gali and Gambetta (2015) by reestimating their time-varying Bayesian VAR model including the shadow rate of Wu and Xia (2016). We found some significant differences when looking at the results during and in the aftermath of the crisis: with the shadow rate, the impact of monetary policy shocks on asset prices becomes negative. There is also a much lower positive impact of monetary policy shocks on bubbles when using the shadow rate. The impact is lower by almost three percentage points.

T2  - Sustainability
AB  - Resulting from the incessant political and economic uncertainty that bedevils the EAC region in the recent past, the various governments have used monetary policy changes in response to shocks from macroeconomic variables. However, the available literature shows a non-agreement by scholars as far as the dynamics in monetary policy, external shocks and macroeconomic activity connections are concerned, for both country-by-country analyses and regional assessments. This article widens the frontiers of knowledge about how the dynamics of monetary policy, external shocks and macroeconomic performance interact within the EAC economic region. We adopted the S-VAR method because of its contemporary nature as far as a transmission of monetary policy approach is concerned. The interconnectivity among the countries of EAC is an indication that any shock to the price of commodities (non-oil commodities) has significant implication on the exchange rate, which will be channelled through the supply of money and monetary policy to the GDP. The need to diversify the productive and export base of member countries, compared to the continuous dependence on one or a few products as the major source of income, is hereby advocated.

T2  - International Journal of Forecasting
AB  - The objective of this paper is to improve the accuracy of financial and monetary forecasts of Canadian output growth by using leading indicator neural network models. We find that neural networks yield statistically lower forecast errors for the year-over-year growth rate of real GDP relative to linear and univariate models. However, such forecast improvements are less notable when forecasting quarterly real GDP growth. Neural networks are unable to outperform a naive no-change model. More pronounced non-linearities at the longer horizon is consistent with the possible asymmetric effects of monetary policy on the real economy.

T2  - CESifo Economic Studies
AB  - This study investigates the extent to which the GDP response to a monetary shock depends on the variation of private debt. This is the marginal contribution of private debt, an effect discussed in the financial accelerator literature. We study the USA, the UK, and Germany in the period 1980 (q1) to 2015 (q4), and compare household debt with corporate debt. Our approach is based on the comparison of one baseline structural VAR with an alternative counterfactual VAR for each country. Our findings indicate that household debt has a significant effect on real output, while corporate debt does not seem to exert a systematic influence. (JEL codes: O11, O16, O51, O52, and E44).

AB  - Controlling inflation and economic growth is one of the most important economic goals that governments seek to achieve through tools such as monetary policy. To achieve their policy goals, monetary policymakers need to have a careful assessment of the effectiveness of monetary policy in the short and long term. The purpose of this study is to investigate the effect of asymmetric shocks of monetary policy on inflation and real output variables in the period 1994:1-2016: 4 using the NARDL technique. The results of the study showed that only positive liquidity shock has a positive and significant effect on GDP and its negative shock has no significant effect on GDP in the long run. Also, according to the results, in the short run, positive and negative liquidity shocks do not have a significant effect on production, but short-term positive liquidity shocks after a break have a positive effect on GDP. Accordingly, the asymmetric effects of positive and negative monetary policies on economic growth are accepted. ....

TI  - The role of banks in the Czech monetary policy transmission mechanism
AU  - Pruteanu-Podpiera, Anca Maria
T2  - Economics of Transition
AB  - With this work, I aim to enrich the knowledge about the monetary policy transmission mechanism in the Czech Republic with empirical evidence on the impact of monetary policy on bank lending. Using a panel of quarterly time series for Czech commercial banks for the period 1996–2001, I study the overall effect of monetary policy changes on the growth rate of loans and the characteristics of the supply of loans. The characterization of the credit market's supply side allows us to make inferences on the operativeness of the credit channel (the bank lending channel and the broad credit channel) of the monetary transmission mechanism. I find that changes in monetary policy alter the growth rate of loans, with considerably stronger magnitude in the period 1999–2001 than in the period 1996–1998. From the analysis intended to capture the characteristics of the supply of loans, I conclude that the lending channel was operative in the period 1996–1998: I find cross-sectional differences in the lending reactions to monetary policy shocks due to the degree of capitalization and to liquidity. For the subsequent period 1999–2001, the results also show distributional effects of monetary policy due to bank size and its bank's proportion of classified loans. In the context of steadily decreasing interest rates, this can bolster the supposition of financial frictions between borrowers and lenders and hence, that of an operative broad credit channel.

Regarding to the importance of U.S. monetary policy in international trade, it is necessary to study the effect of monetary policy shocks of this country on gross domestic product of major oil-exporting countries for determining macroeconomic policies and forecasts in a global and dynamic framework. In this paper we examine the impact of U.S. monetary policy on GDP of major oil-exporting countries in the period of 1974-2017 using GVAR approach. The results indicate that the effect of U.S. Monetary shocks on GDP of these countries is different in short-term and long-term.

AB  - This paper empirically examines the effect of monetary policy on exchange rates during currency crises. We find strong evidence that raising the interest rate: (i) has larger adverse balance sheet effects and is therefore less effective in countries with high domestic corporate short-term debt; (ii) is more credible and therefore more effective in countries with high-quality institutions; (iii) is more credible and therefore more effective in countries with high external debt; and (iv) is less effective in countries with high capital account openness. Our results support the idea that the effect of monetary policy depends on its impact on fundamentals, as well as its credibility, as suggested in the recent theoretical literature.

AB  - This paper contributes to the literature on nonlinear effects of monetary policy on different economic variables. We apply threshold vector autoregression analysis to study nonlinear transmission of euro area monetary policy shocks to the supply and demand in the euro area´s consumer credit market. Two regimes of financial stress and two of gross domestic product (GDP) growth are modeled and then separately studied the effects of shocks in the shadow rate of monetary policy in the euro area. We find that the effects of monetary policy are larger in the high financial stress and low GDP growth regimes than in their counterparts (low financial stress and normal GDP growth, respectively). The response of demand for loans is generally larger than that of supply of loans. No nonlinearities associated with the size of the monetary policy shock are found.

TI  - Assessing the Transmission of Monetary Policy Using Time-varying Parameter Dynamic Factor Models*
AU  - Korobilis, Dimitris
T2  - Oxford Bulletin of Economics and Statistics
AB  - This article extends the current literature which questions the stability of the monetary transmission mechanism, by proposing a factor-augmented vector autoregressive (VAR) model with time-varying coefficients and stochastic volatility. The VAR coefficients and error covariances may change gradually in every period or be subject to abrupt breaks. The model is applied to 143 post-World War II quarterly variables fully describing the US economy. I show that both endogenous and exogenous shocks to the US economy resulted in the high inflation volatility during the 1970s and early 1980s. The time-varying factor augmented VAR produces impulse responses of inflation which significantly reduce the price puzzle. Impulse responses of other indicators of the economy show that the most notable changes in the transmission of unanticipated monetary policy shocks occurred for gross domestic product, investment, exchange rates and money.

TI  - The Perceived Causes of Monetary Policy Surprises
AU  - Acosta, Miguel
AB  - I estimate the macroeconomic eﬀects of two critical aspects of Federal Reserve (Fed) communications: forward guidance regarding the path of interest rates and the provision of macroeconomic information. To estimate these eﬀects, I identify two new series of shocks: monetary policy shocks and “information shocks.” I recover the shocks by estimating a model of how Fed announcements determine interest-rate and GDP expectations in high frequency, using a measure of GDP forecast revisions I construct from the text of newspaper articles. To identify the model, I use a discrete change in the Fed’s communication policy: the introduction of interest-rate forward guidance. I ﬁnd that the identiﬁed monetary shock has macroeconomic eﬀects that are consistent with New Keynesian models, and fall at the upper end of previous estimates. Additionally, information shocks have eﬀects of similar (absolute) magnitude as monetary shocks, which highlights the importance of the Fed’s role in providing macroeconomic information and shaping macroeconomic expectations. Finally, jointly analyzing newspaper-text measures of GDP and inﬂation expectations reveals that the information shock resembles an aggregate demand shock.

We analyze the rule using three very different economic models to see if the rule works well in different environments. Our results suggest that while the rule leads to lower inflation than there has been over the last 30 years, instability problems suggest that the rule should be modified to feed back on the growth rate of nominal GDP rather than the level.

AB  - The aims of this study were to examine the relative importance of monetary policy and fiscal policy on economic growth in Ghana and then determine which of these two policies is more powerful in promoting economic growth in Ghana. The study period was from 1980 to 2012. The method of Ordinary Least Squares estimation technique was used in this study. The results obtained from the three multiple regressions were spurious free. The study revealed that monetary policy impacts on the Ghanaian economy positively. Also, the study found that fiscal policy affected the Ghanaian economy positively. Finally, the study revealed that monetary policy is more powerful in promoting economic growth in Ghana. The study recommends that monetary policies implemented by the Bank of Ghana should promote favorable investment atmosphere through appropriate stabilization of interest rates, lending rates, inflationary rates, and exchange rates to promote and ensure economic growth, economic stability, economic sustainability and economic development in Ghana.

Design/methodology/approach Depending on data availability, the study employed secondary data covering the period of 1980–2019. The augmented Dickey–Fuller test and the Phillips–Perron test were used for the stationarity test. Further, the F-bounds test was run to justify the long-run relationship between monetary policy and economic growth. Thereafter, long-run coefficients were revealed from the auto-regressive distributed lag (ARDL) model and short-run coefficients from the error correction model. Furthermore, the vector error correction model (VECM) Granger causality approach was employed to demonstrate the causality of studied variables. Lastly, different diagnostics tests ensured the robustness of the models. Findings F-bounds test outcomes suggest that monetary policy has a long-run relationship with economic growth in both countries. Long-run coefficients revealed that money supply has a positive long-run impact on economic growth in both countries. Unlike the UK, the exchange rate exhibits an adverse effect on the economic growth of Bangladesh. The bank rate seems to promote economic growth for the UK. Findings also depict that increase in lending interest rates hurts the economic growth for both countries. Besides, the short-run coefficients portray random effects at different lags in both cases. Lastly, causality among studied variables is revealed using the VECM Granger causality approach. Originality/value The novelty of this study lies in consideration of both developing and developed countries in the same study.

AB  - This study attempts to examine the relationship between monetary policy and housing prices in India. We use monthly data from January 2009 to December 2018 of four variables-Housing Price Index (HPI), Real Effective Exchange Rate (REER),Gross Domestic Price (GDP), and interest rate for our estimations using the Autoregressive Distributive Lag (ARDL) Model. The results from the study show that the impact of monetary policy on housing prices is significant only on lag three; however, the coefficient is very small. The results from the ARDL model are also supported by the variance decomposition of housing price. The variance decomposition of housing prices highlights that monetary policy explains around 13 percent of the variation in housing prices over a period of ten months. Further, the accumulated impulse response function reveals that with one-unit shock to interest rate results in a -0.000875 unit change in housing price. The study stipulates that, since conventional monetary policy has a modest impact on housing prices, therefore, it is insignificant for addressing the problems of real estate in India

T2  - Journal of Financial Stability
AB  - This paper examines the interplay among bank liquidity creation (which incorporates all bank on- and off-balance sheet activities), monetary policy, and financial crises. We find that: (1) high liquidity creation (relative to trend) – particularly off-balance sheet liquidity creation – helps predict crises, controlling for other factors; (2) monetary policy has statistically significant, but economically minor effects on liquidity creation by small banks during normal times, and these effects are even weaker during financial crises; (3) monetary policy has very little effects on medium and large bank liquidity creation during both normal times and crises. These findings suggest that authorities may wish to monitor bank liquidity creation closely in order to predict and perhaps lessen the likelihood of financial crises. They might also consider other tools to control bank liquidity creation, such as capital and liquidity requirements.

AB  - The heating debate about increasing income inequality forces monetary policy makers and academia to (re-)assess the nexus between (unconventional) monetary policy and inequality. We use a VAR framework to unveil the distributional effects of monetary policy and the role of redistribution in six advanced economies. While all of them experience an increase in Gini coefficients of gross income due to an expansionary monetary policy shock, only countries with relatively little redistribution display a significant response of net income inequality as well. To examine the underlying transmission channels we take a closer look at the sources of income, i.e. labor and capital income. Our findings suggest that the disproportional surge in capital income is the driving force behind the increase in net income inequality.

TI  - The Effects of Monetary Policy on Poverty Alleviation in Pakistan
AU  - Saeed, Maryam
AB  - This research analyzes the effect of monetary policy of central bank on the poverty alleviation. Monetary policy is the policy adopted by the monetary authority of a country that controls either the interest rate payable on very short-term borrowing or the money supply, targeting inflation or the interest rate to ensure price stability and general trust in the currency. This study is taking two variables in monetary policy namely interest rate and money supply. Effects of both variables examined on poverty rate in context of Pakistan. Moreover, association and effect examined between both variables (interest rate and money supply). This study comprises on quantitative research methodology as secondary data taken from world indicator from 2001 to 2017. Regression analysis applied on collected data. According to findings, if central bank increases in supply of money in economy, it cannot reduce poverty rate in Pakistan. It is because more money supply will bring inflation, which discourages investment of all types. If high interest rate set by central bank then it cannot bring significant reduction in poverty rate of Pakistan as it will reduces the investment and overall employment. If central bank set increased interest rate then it deceases the money supply in the economy of Pakistan, as funds will be, divert to banks for earning interest on deposits. Recommendations and conclusion are given at the end of this paper.

AB  - This paper empirically examines the effect of monetary policy effectiveness on human development in Africa. We employ both micro-bank level and macro-country level data. Bank level data are taken from the bank scope database maintained by Fitch/IBCA/Bureau Van Dijk. Series are yearly, covering a sample of 320 banks across 29 African countries. Panel fixed effects, random effects and IV regressions were estimated for the period 2002 to 2013. For our IV estimation, the paper explores an instrumental variable based on the fact that effective monetary policy is conditional on the independence of the central bank. The regression results that ensued suggest that; first, effective monetary policy translates to high banks' loan and deposit prices. Building on these results and employing various specifications of banks' pricing strategy, the second test suggests that, high banks' pricing induced by effective monetary policy tends to increase human development. Results of the net effects eventually suggest that effective monetary policy, overall, does not improve human development.

AB  - After the recent financial crisis, few issues receive more attention than central banks’ actions or major macroeconomic announcements in markets. Motivated by this fact, we investigate the impact of specific macro-announcements on liquidity commonality in Turkey. Using a weighted spread constructed by a proprietary database of order flows, we reveal that among several developed countries, only U.S. monetary policy and macroeconomic announcements raise commonality in liquidity. Moreover, commonality is significantly affected (increased) only beyond the best price quotes, showing that researchers may obtain misleading results on commonality if they consider spread at the best price levels as a liquidity proxy.

AB  - The purpose of this article is to quantify how bank capital determines the effects of monetary policy on bank lending. Additionally, we test how these effects differ during monetary contractions and expansions. Using a sample of 3,028 European banks between 1999 and 2012, we find that the reduction in loans caused by monetary restrictions is similar across banks regardless of their capital. In addition, during monetary expansions, banks increase their loan supply more as they become better capitalized. Contrary to previous studies, there are differences in the monetary policy transmission through capital only during expansionary monetary regimes. These results are relevant because previous studies have not measured how the marginal effect of monetary policy on the growth of loans varies with the value of capital. We contribute to the existing literature by using a new approach that quantifies this marginal effect, which considerably improves the interpretation of statistical results from models that include continuous variable interactions and allows a better understanding of the role of bank capital in the transmission of monetary shocks.

AB  - We analyse the impact of standard and non-standard monetary policy on bank profitability. We use both proprietary and commercial data on individual euro area bank balance-sheets and market prices. Our results show that a monetary policy easing – a decrease in short-term interest rates and/or a flattening of the yield curve – is not associated with lower bank profits once we control for the endogeneity of the policy measures to expected macroeconomic and financial conditions. Accommodative monetary conditions asymmetrically affect the main components of bank profitability, with a positive impact on loan loss provisions and non-interest income offsetting the negative one on net interest income. A protracted period of low monetary rates has a negative effect on profits that, however, only materializes after a long time period and is counterbalanced by improved macroeconomic conditions. Monetary policy easing surprises during the low interest rate period improve bank stock prices and CDS.

AB  - Utilizing a bank-lending channel framework, we investigate the effects of expansionary and contractionary policy separately on the loan behavior of low-capital and high-capital banks, and between pre-Basel/FDICIA and post-Basel/FDICIA periods. Our results show that low-capital banks are adversely affected by contractionary policy. Expansionary policy, however, is not effective in stimulating the loan growth of low-capital banks. These results are consistent with lending channel predictions, but only hold in the post-Basel/FDICIA period when the capital constraint is stringent relative to the pre-Basel/FDICIA period. These asymmetric policy results have implications for the interaction of monetary and capital regulatory policies.

First, the paper develops an analytical method to analyze the effect of data-revision errors in GDP on the ex-ante or conditional inflation-output-growth volatility trade-off and applies it to Swiss data. Second, the effects of different targets in a forward-looking monetary policy on ex-post or unconditional volatility of inflation and output growth is explored with a simulation exercise. In general, the results suggest that focusing monetary policy on GDP growth instead of inflation may lead to an inefficient policy with both increased medium-term inflation and GDP growth volatility in the presence of GDP data revisions.

TI  - Monetary Policy Transmission Mechanism and Macroeconomic Aggregates in Nigeria
AU  - Adeoye, Babatunde
AU  - Shobande, Olatunji
T2  - Caleb Journal of Social and Management Science
AB  - Economists do not agree about how monetary policy affects the real economy.
Different studies blame the consequence of this process on different channel
through which monetary policy works. Worrisomely, lack of consensus in
existing studies has led to a renewed motivation since understanding the process
is essential for designing and implementation of monetary policy. This paper
argues that, in studying monetary transmission mechanism process,
consideration should be given to its impact on policy and less emphasis on
random shocks basically because shocks account for less fraction of the policy
instruments inconsistency. It further argues that the effects of monetary
transmission mechanism on economic aggregates requires structurally modeling
rather than VAR framework that lack policy direction as well as any meaningful
economic interpretation. The paper therefore presents a structural model
estimated using the Vector Error Correction (VEC) technique to determine the
effect of interest rate channel of monetary transmission mechanism on the real
economy variables considered. Our findings show that money supply, expected
inflation, real interest rate and exchange rate are crucial for any meaningful
economic growth, suggesting that manipulation of these variables is essential
for the effectiveness of monetary policy in Nigeria. In all, we recommend that
effectiveness of monetary policy through the manipulation of interest rate and
exchange rate is essential for stability in the economy.

AB  - We analyze the impact of monetary policy on the supply of bank credit. Monetary policy affects both loan supply and demand, thus making identification a steep challenge. We therefore analyze a novel, supervisory dataset with loan applications from Spain. Accounting for time-varying firm heterogeneity in loan demand, we find that tighter monetary and worse economic conditions substantially reduce loan granting, especially from banks with lower capital or liquidity ratios; responding to applications for the same loan, weak banks are less likely to grant the loan. Finally, firms cannot offset the resultant credit restriction by applying to other banks. (JEL E32, E44, E52, G21, G32)

The results are uncertain but indicate that the stock of household loans is 1.6 percent lower two years after a 1 percentage point shock to the repo rate. This is a relatively modest effect considering that the stock of household loans on average grew by 7.8 percent per year over this period.

Based on a sample of 24 developed countries, our empirical analysis suggests that monetary policy is less effective following a financial crisis as the monetary transmission mechanism is partially impaired. In particular, our results suggest that the benefits of accommodative monetary policy during a downturn are elusive when the downturn is associated with a financial crisis. In addition, we find that private sector deleveraging during a downturn helps to induce a stronger recovery.

AU  - Pellegrino, Giovanni
T2  - Economic Inquiry
AB  - This paper estimates a nonlinear vector autoregression (VAR) model to assess whether the real effects of monetary policy shocks depend on the level of uncertainty. Crucially, uncertainty is modeled endogenously in the VAR, thus allowing to take account of two unexplored channels of monetary policy transmission working through uncertainty direct reaction and uncertainty mean reversion. We find that monetary policy shocks are about 50–75% more powerful during tranquil times than during firm- and macro-level uncertain times. Failing to account for endogenous uncertainty would bias responses and imply twice more effective monetary policy during tranquil times, mainly because of the non-consideration of uncertainty mean reversion.

TI  - Monetary Policy and the Top One Percent: Evidence from a Century of Modern Economic History
AU  - El Herradi, Mehdi
AU  - Leroy, Aurélien
AB  - This paper examines the distributional implications of monetary pol-icy from a long-run perspective with data spanning a century of modern economic history in 12 advanced economies between 1920 and 2015. We employ two complementary empirical methodologies for estimating the dynamic responses of the top 1% income share to a monetary policy shock: vector auto-regressions and local projections. We notably exploit the implications of the macroeconomic policy trilemma to identify exogenous variations in monetary conditions. The obtained results indicate that ex-pansionary monetary policy strongly increases the share of national income held by the top one percent. Our findings also suggest that this effect is arguably driven by higher asset prices, and holds irrespective of the state of the economy.

AB  - This paper empirically examines the effect of monetary policy effectiveness on human development in Africa. We employ both micro-bank level and macro-country level data. Bank level data are taken from the bank scope database maintained by Fitch/IBCA/Bureau Van Dijk. Series are yearly, covering a sample of 320 banks across 29 African countries. Panel fixed effects, random effects and IV regressions were estimated for the period 2002 to 2013. For our IV estimation, the paper explores an instrumental variable based on the fact that effective monetary policy is conditional on the independence of the central bank. The regression results that ensued suggest that; first, effective monetary policy translates to high banks' loan and deposit prices. Building on these results and employing various specifications of banks' pricing strategy, the second test suggests that, high banks' pricing induced by effective monetary policy tends to increase human development. Results of the net effects eventually suggest that effective monetary policy, overall, does not improve human development.

AB  - The objective of this study was to examine the effect of monetary policy and private investment on green finance in the case of Hungary. The study used an explanatory research design and a quantitative research approach. Quarterly secondary time series data over 8 years (2013–2020) were utilized. More specifically, the study used Johnson co-integration test and vector error correction model to investigate the long and short-run relationship among variables. The study’s findings imply that monetary policy, as measured by interest rates and the broad money supply, has a mixed effect on the level of green financing. Interest rates, in particular, have a negative and significant relationship with green finance in both the long and short run. However, a broad money supply has a positive but insignificant relationship with green finance in the long run. Private investment has a positive and significant relationship with green financing in both the long and short run. The study also used inward and outward foreign direct investment, and greenhouse gas as a control variable of the study. The study finding implies that inward foreign direct investment has a positive and significant relationship with green financing in both the long and short run. On the other hand, outward foreign direct investment and the level of greenhouse gas have a negative and significant relationship with green finance in both the long and short run. The study also discovered that over time series, disturbance in domestic private investment was the most determinant factor in forecast error variance of green financing. In addition, the result of document analysis shows that the majority of Hungarian credit institutions are dealing with their corporate strategy rather than their sustainability strategy. Hence, progressive approaches are needed from the credit institution to frame their strategy under the concept of sustainable development goals. The finding of this study will contribute to the existing literature on the study area, provide suggestions on green finance and green monetary policy approaches, provide implications on key stakeholders of green financing, as well as the experience of different economies. The study advises central banks, credit institutions, and regulatory authorities to consider both neoliberal and reformist approaches of green finance and green monetary policies in aid to increase green investment.

AB  - We define a measure to be a financial vulnerability if, in a VAR framework that allows for nonlinearities, an impulse to the measure leads to an economic contraction. We evaluate alternative macrofinancial imbalances as vulnerabilities: nonfinancial sector credit, risk appetite of financial market participants, and the leverage and short-term funding of financial firms. We find that nonfinancial credit is a vulnerability: impulses to the credit-to-GDP gap when it is high leads to a recession. Risk appetite leads to an economic expansion in the near-term, but also higher credit and a recession in later years, suggesting an intertemporal tradeoff. Monetary policy is generally ineffective at slowing the economy once the credit-to-GDP gap is high, suggesting important benefits from avoiding excessive credit growth. Financial sector leverage and short-term funding do not lead directly to contractions and thus are not vulnerabilities by our definition.

AB  - This article investigates the dynamic and bi-causal link between monetary policy and financial inclusion in sub-Saharan Africa using a panel VAR framework. The researcher obtained data from World Development Indicators (WDI) spanning from 1990 to 2014 for 48 sub-Saharan African economies. The findings suggest that a bi-causal relationship exists between monetary policy and financial inclusion. Specifically, it is evident that monetary policy affects financial inclusion, and financial inclusion is also influenced by monetary policy. The policy implication of this study is that the effectiveness of monetary policy depends on financial inclusion. Hence, the efforts of governments in sub-Saharan African countries should aim at policies that enhance financial inclusion for effective implementation of monetary policy. Also, promoting financial inclusion will require governments in sub-Saharan Africa to reduce their monetary policy rates.

AB  - The study investigated the effects of monetary policy on bank lending and economic performance in Nigeria for the period of 35 years which covered 1984 to 2018. The study addressed broad money supply, monetary policy rate, prime lending rate and inflation rate as monetary policy indicators while real gross domestic product was regressed as economic performance. The data were gathered from Nigeria Central Bank Statistical Bulletin and National Bureau of Statistics. The study employed two models to analyse the effect of monetary policy on bank lending and economic performance respectively by applying the estimation techniques of Augmented Dickey Fuller (ADF)stationarity test and regression analysis. Evidence from model one positioned that money supply and inflation rate have significant influence on bank lending while and monetary policy rate had insignificant influence on bank lending. The second model discovered that money supply has significant influence on economic performance whereas other variables of prime lending rate,monetary policy rate and inflation rate have negative and insignificant effect on economic performance under the study period. However, the study concluded that monetary policy positively and significantly influenced economic performance in Nigeria. It was therefore recommended that Nigeria’s banks should align to government vision of price stability, as well as facilitating the regulatory and supervisory frameworks to secure a strong financial sector for efficient intermediation.

AU  - Frankel, Jeffrey A.
AB  - In this second collection of his writings on financial markets (the first, On Exchange Rates, covered international finance), Jeffrey Frankel turns his attention to domestic markets, with special attention to how national monetary policy is handled. The decade of the 1980s left many central bankers disillusioned with monetarism, so that the question of the optimal nominal anchor remains an open one. In this second collection of his writings on financial markets (the first, On Exchange Rates, covered international finance), Jeffrey Frankel turns his attention to domestic markets, with special attention to how national monetary policy is handled. The fifteen papers are divided into three sections, each introduced by the author. They cover, respectively, optimal portfolio diversification, indicators of expected inflation, and the determination of monetary policy in the face of uncertainty. In the first section, Frankel explores what information the theory of optimal portfolio diversification can give the macroeconomist. In the second section, he considers what economic variables central bankers might use to gauge whether monetary policy is too tight or too loose. And in the final section, he looks at the range of uncertainty over policy effects and how that complicates coordination of macroeconomic policymaking. The book concludes with a sympathetic analysis of nominal GDP targeting.

In this paper we conduct a more detailed analysis by studying various sub-segments of the real estate market. Employing a new dataset for Switzerland we estimate vector autoregressive models and find positive interest rate shocks to have adverse effects on house and condominium prices on the one hand and rental prices on the other. Commercial property prices as stock markets do not react on interest rate variations.
