AB  - Monetary policy decisions tend to be based on systematic analysis of alternative policy choices and their associated macroeconomic impacts: this is science. Fiscal policy choices, in contrast, spring from unsystematic speculation, grounded more in politics than economics: this is alchemy. In normal times, fiscal alchemy poses no insurmountable problems for monetary policy because fiscal expectations can be extrapolated from past fiscal behavior. But normal times may be coming to an end: aging populations are causing promised government old-age benefits to grow relentlessly and many governments have no plans for financing the benefits. In this era of fiscal stress, fiscal expectations are unanchored and fiscal alchemy creates unnecessary uncertainty and can undermine the ability of monetary policy to control inflation and influence real economic activity in the usual ways.

TI  - The Recent Monetary Policy and Money Demand in Japan
AU  - Miyagawa, Shigeyoshi

T2  - Discussion Papers
AB  - After the burst of the bubble, the Japanese economy has experienced a hard recession which Japan has never experienced after the war. The Japanese government conducted the huge public investment without success. The Bank of Japan also performed the low interest policy to boost the economy. However, Japanese economy got worse after 1997 when the leading financial institutions suddenly collapsed. The Japanese economy had plunged into the deflationary spiral. The BOJ took the so-called zero interest policy after 1999 to fight against the deflationary pressure. Furthermore, it started the qualitative easing policy by increasing the outright purchase of government bond after March 2001. The policy stands on the idea that money stock has the positive effect on the economy. The money demand has to be stable for the policy to succeed. The bank of Japan (2003) recently reported that the long-run equilibrium relationship between money stock and real economic activity can no longer be detected, though such relationship could be found before 1997. In this paper we quantify that money stock has a positive relationship with real economic activity, and money demand is still stable. We found one cointegration in the cointegration test between money stock, real GDP, and share price in the period from 1981 through 1997. However the cointegration has broken out when the sample period was extended beyond 1997, as the BOJ (2003) suggests. We performed the cointegration test again by comprising a new variable: financial anxiety and found one cointegration. Dynamic money demand function was estimated with an error correction term. The result was almost statistically satisfactory, suggesting the stability of money demand.

AB  - The transmission of monetary policy to credit aggregates and the real economy can be impaired by weaknesses in the contracting environment, shallow financial markets, and a concentrated banking system. We empirically assess the bank lending channel in Uganda during 2010–2014 using a supervisory dataset of loan applications and granted loans. Our analysis focuses on a short period during which the policy rate rose by 1,000 basis points and then came down by 1,200 basis points. We find that an increase in interest rates reduces the supply of bank credit both on the extensive and intensive margins, and there is significant pass-through to retail lending rates. We document a strong bank balance sheet channel, as the lending behavior of banks with high capital and liquidity is different from that of banks with low capital and liquidity. Finally, we show the impact of monetary policy on real activity across districts depends on banking sector conditions. Overall, our results indicate significant real effects of the bank lending channel in developing countries.

T2  - Studia Prawno-Ekonomiczne
AB  - Background: The monetary policy of the Federal Reserve System affects the term structure of nominal interest rates as well as other asset prices, and thus influences aggregate demand and price levels through these effects. This complex process is known as the monetary transmission mechanism and the transmission process of monetary impulses changes over time. The strength of this impact is a staple subject of economic research.Research purpose: The aim of the article is to assess the effectiveness of the Federal Reserve System’s monetary policy transmission mechanism over the period 1962–2018. In particular, the scale and timing of the interest rate pass-through to economic activity have been examined.Methods: Econometric methods (the vector autoregression model) have been used. The empirical analysis was carried out based on U.S. economic statistics for the years 1962–2018, which were taken from the FRED and BEA Databases.1Conclusions: Empirical findings reveal that the way in which the Federal Reserve System’s monetary policy influenced the U.S. economy was diversified at particular time intervals. The results imply that the effectiveness of the U.S. central bank’s interest rate policy has been decreasing since the mid-1980s. Firstly, in the period 1962–1983, the real GDP growth rate and the inflation rate were more sensitive to changes in the federal funds rate than in the period 1984–2018. Secondly, in the period 1962–1983, the effective federal funds rate had an almost threefold greater impact on economic activity and price processes. Thirdly, until the mid-1980s, the effects of monetary impulses were felt longer in the American economy than in the later period. What is more, there is no evidence to suggest that the period of historically low interest rates caused a decline in the effectiveness of the transmission of monetary policy impulses.

AU  - Ghossoub, Edgar A.
T2  - Southern Economic Journal
AB  - Monetary growth models in which the government is a net debtor demonstrate that inflation adversely affects capital formation through the crowding out effect. Interestingly, the results are at odds with empirical evidence. In particular, recent studies point to an asymmetric relationship between inflation and the real economy across countries. Specifically, inflation and output are negatively correlated in poor countries. In contrast, inflation is associated with higher levels of economic activity in advanced economies. I present a monetary growth model with public debt, where the exposure to risk is inversely related to the level of income. In this setting, I demonstrate that the effects of monetary policy depend on the level of capital of the economy. In poor countries, banks' portfolios consist primarily of government liabilities. Therefore, a higher rate of money creation inhibits capital formation in these economies. In contrast, banks devote more resources toward productive uses in advanced countries. Consequently, monetary policy generates a Tobin effect.

All around the world, and particularly in so-called “advanced economies”, the covid-19 pandemicCovid-19 pandemic has revealed the flaws of neoliberalismneoliberalism, notably in respect of (a lack of) State intervention and regulation of economic activity. As regards monetary policymonetary policy, it is plain that central banks should not limit their focus to price stability, but must first and foremost act to guarantee financial stabilityfinancial stability—which has become a major issue after the outbreak of the global financial crisisglobal financial crisis (GFC) in 2008. Now, owing to the urgent needs to act against the huge damages caused by climate change all over the world, monetary policymonetary policy should also contribute to a collective effort in supporting and carrying out an ecological transitionecological transition that favours economic development for the common good, thereby satisfying people’s needs. This is the reason why the public sector must promote a green new deal with the monetary and financial support of central banks. The former should issue “green bonds” to finance the ecological transitionecological transition, which the latter should buy on the primary market, and introduce in the list of eligible assets to be used as collateral by any banks in need of liquidityliquidity on the interbank market. Further, central banks should steer their policy rates of interest with a view to support and then to enhance the ecological transitionecological transition. This amounts to reducing the interest rate for those loans that support such a transition, particularly as regards firms’ “green” investments. Central banks will thereby contribute to make the world a better place to live in, both as regards climate conditions and financial stabilityfinancial stability. In such a framework, firms’ business will benefit from central banks’ decisions, as far as the former contributes to achieve the policy targets of the latter. Social cohesion will be enhanced thereby, and the world will become a better place to live in, with a sustainable economy over the long run.

AB  - This paper examines the impact of financial market development and liberalization on money demand behavior in Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore, and Thailand since the early 1980s. The empirical results indicate continuing instability in the interaction of money growth, economic activity, and inflation. Rapid growth and ongoing changes in financial markets suggest that policy needs to be guided by a wider set of monetary and real sector indicators of inflationary pressures. The feasibility of alternative policy frameworks--including nominal exchange rate targets, and inflation targets--is discussed in the context of the substantial and sustained increase in foreign capital inflows.

This paper seeks to see the influence of the exchange rate on the inflation rate and to find out if the lowering of the inflation was made with the cost of high unemployment in Romania, using monthly data during 2002-2009. The exchange rate channel still has a high influence on the inflation rate as the coefficient was found significant. A positive aspect that we depicted is that the low level of inflation had not been attained with the cost of a high unemployment rate at least till the signs of the economic crisis became obvious

AB  - The paper highlights monetary policy transmission mechanism in Nigeria focusing on empirical studies and happenings in the country that retarded the efficiency of the Central Bank of Nigeria over the years in the pursuant of effective transmission mechanism. The empirical reviews from studies show that interest rate, credit channels and exchange rate are among the channels of monetary policy transmission to the economy. It also highlights some of the problems that imposed a serious debility to effective transmission in Nigeria The authors made some suggestions for improvement, among which include: the Central Bank must persevere legally, morally and otherwise to make the economy a cashless one. The low patronage of banking services by many Nigerians is a stumbling block in effective control of money supply which has contributed to incessant inflation in the country; any form of disguise or indirect interference by the government has to be put to an end; and the instruments of monetary policy such as interest rate and exchange rate that are known to be effective in some sectors should be properly managed and monitored.

AB  - One of the most robust stylized facts in macroeconomics is the forecasting power of the term spread for future real activity. We propose a possible causal mechanism for the forecasting power of the term spread, deriving from the balance sheet management of financial intermediaries and the “risk-taking channel of monetary policy.” Monetary tightening leads to the flattening of the term spread, reducing net interest margin and credit supply. We provide empirical support for the risk-taking channel.

TI  - Output Gaps and Robust Monetary Policy Rules
AU  - Billi, Roberto M.
AB  - Policymakers often use the output gap, a noisy signal of economic activity, as a guide for setting monetary policy. Noise in the data argues for policy caution. At the same time, the zero bound on nominal interest rates constrains the central bank's ability to stimulate the economy during downturns. In such an environment, greater policy stimulus may be needed to stabilize the economy. Thus, noisy data and the zero bound present policymakers with a dilemma in deciding the appropriate stance for monetary policy. I investigate this dilemma in a small New Keynesian model, and show that policymakers should pay more attention to output gaps than suggested by previous research.

We find no sound evidence of a link between a number of different finance mix variables and economic activity in New Zealand. Similar, unfavourable results are reported by the investigation of the connection between movements in an interest rate spread and real economic performance. Moreover, neither the finance mix variables nor the spread respond consistently to changes in various indicators of monetary policy.

AB  - In recent years, there has been increased attention devoted to studying housing markets across countries. In particular, the impact of monetary policy and in‡ation on housing performance is of great interest. However, there is limited data on housing market activity across the developing world which renders it di¢ cult to understand the e¤ects of policy empirically. Due to these limitations, we study the e¤ects of monetary policy on housing market activity using a variation of the neoclassical growth model which is often used to study the process of economic development. Consistent with the limited observations on the relationship between residential investment and GDP across countries, there are signi…cant non-linearities between housing market activity and aggregate income in our framework.

AB  - The Bank of Canada’s mandate is to target an inflation rate of 2 percent, but financial instability can have important effects on economic activity, which can influence the Bank’s ability to hit that target. The concern is that monetary policy and financial stability might work at cross-purposes if, for example, stimulative monetary policy increases financial vulnerabilities. However, our results show that contractionary monetary policy shocks significantly reduce financial vulnerabilities, while expansionary shocks have little to no significant effect. These findings suggest that Canadian monetary policy does not, in fact, work at cross-purposes to financial stability.

AU  - Leduc, Sylvain

T2  - The Review of Economics and Statistics
AB  - Using survey-based measures of future U.S. economic activity from the Livingston Survey and the Survey of Professional Forecasters, we study how changes in expectations and their interaction with monetary policy contribute to fluctuations in macroeconomic aggregates. We find that changes in expected future economic activity are a quantitatively important driver of economic fluctuations: a perception that good times are ahead typically leads to a significant rise in current measures of economic activity and inflation. We also find that the short-term interest rate rises in response to expectations of good times as monetary policy tightens.

TI  - The effectiveness of monetary policy transmission under capital inflows: Evidence from Asia
AU  - Jain-Chandra, Sonali
AU  - Unsal, D. Filiz
T2  - Borsa Istanbul Review
AB  - The effectiveness of the monetary policy transmission mechanism in open economies could be impaired if interest rates are driven primarily by global factors, especially during periods of large capital inflows. The main objective of this paper is to assess whether this is true for emerging Asia's economies. Using a dynamic factor model and a structural vector autoregression model, we show that long-term interest rates in Asia are indeed predominantly driven by global factors. However, monetary policy transmission mechanism remains effective in the region, as it operates predominantly through short-term interest rates. Nevertheless, the monetary transmission mechanism, though effective, is somewhat weaker in Asia during the periods of surges in capital inflows.

AU  - Svensson, Lars E O
AB  - The Bernanke-Reinhart-Sack paper mostly focuses on alternative policies in a liquidity trap to aﬀect expectations of future interest rates. But the problem in a liquidity trap is rather to raise private-sector expectations of the future price level. Increased expectations of the future price level are likely to be much more aﬀective in reducing the real interest rate and stimulating the economy out of a liquidity trap than further lowering of already very low expectations of future interest rates. Therefore, monetary-policy alternatives in a liquidity trap should be assessed theoretically and empirically according to how eﬀective they are in aﬀecting privatesector expectations of the future price level.

AB  - A positive slope of the yield curve is associated with a future increase in real economic activity: consumption (nondurables plus services), consumer durables, and investment. It has extra predictive power over the index of leading indicators, real short-term interest rates, lagged growth in economic activity, and lagged rates of inflation. It outperforms survey forecasts, both in-sample and out-of-sample. Historically, the information in the slope reflected, inter alia, factors that were independent of monetary policy, and thus the slope could have provided useful information both to private investors and to policy makers.

First, we briefly consider the conditions that have determined the monetary policy of Banxico since 1995; next, we analyze the elements of this policy–the “corto”–and the management of the monetary impact of foreign cash flows and the contingent public debt. Finally, we discuss the tensions and disequilibrium factors included in this policy and finish with some considerations about policy options. RESUMEN.

AB  - Following the recent financial crisis, major central banks have introduced several types of unconventional monetary policy measures, including liquidity and credit facilities, asset purchases and forward guidance. To date, these measures appear to have been successful. They restored market functioning, facilitated the transmission of monetary policy and supported economic activity. They have potential costs, however, including challenges related to the greatly expanded balance sheets of central banks and the eventual exit from these measures, as well as the vulnerabilities that can arise from prolonged monetary accommodation.

The objectives of this chapter are to gather the little that has been written on Post Keynesian monetary policy, and to identify a few general guidelines around which Post Keynesians could agree when it comes to non-specific monetary policy recommendations. In the following, the term Post Keynesian is meant to cover contributions on money and inflation from the so-called American Post Keynesians, as well as those of the Cambridge (England) Keynesians, and those of the neo-Ricardians. It will be obvious that the views of the radical school are quite similar. I shall start by establishing how I view the links which exist between circuit theory and Post Keynesian economics.

AU  - Petryk, O.
AU  - Deysan, I.
T2  - Economy and Forecasting
AB  - This paper examines the effect of the monetary transmission mechanism in the cross-sectoral context. The transmission mechanism from refinancing rate, liquidity and hryvnia exchange rate against the U.S. dollar to sectoral lending and economic activity was studied using a structural VAR-model. A significant heterogeneity in the response of sectoral indicators was found, which should be taken into account by the National Bank of Ukraine when setting up monetary policy. In particular, the transmission to consumer lending rates differs from the transmission to corporate and interbank lending rates, as well as government lending rates. Consumer credit rates are reduced due to rising liquidity and do not react to refinancing rates. An unexpected decrease in such rates after the devaluation was evidently due to partial realization of the currency risk. The volumes of lending to the population depend only on the hryvnia to the dollar exchange rate. That is, the National Bank has virtually no direct influence on consumer lending. In addition, the change in interest rate channel from the beginning of 2015 was studied using a panel VAR-model. A positive change in monetary transmission during this period was the emergence of an effective interest rate channel, and hence effective transmission of the NBU refinancing rate to the short-term rates on loans in national currency. The pass-through of the weighted average rate on the NBU refinancing operations to short-term bank lending rates is about 30-40% (that is, such rates increase by 0.3-0.4 percentage points in response to 1 percentage point increase in the refinancing rate).

AB  - This paper considers the existence of a bank lending channel in Chile. Toward that, we collect a data sample of nineteen banks that operated in Chile over January 1999- December 2002. In that period, banks primarily offered loans to firms in the manufacturing and the financial-services sectors (representing 13 and 26 percent of total loans, respectively), and to households through consumption and mortgage loans (at 9 and 10 percent of total loans, respectively). Our estimation results support the existence of a bank lending channel. We find that banks respond asymmetrically to monetary shocks depending upon their own characteristics, and that monetary shocks alter loan portfolio decisions in the aggregate.

AB  - This paper asks whether the BoJ's recent experience with unconventional monetary easing has been effective in supporting economic activity and inflation. Using a structural VAR model, the paper finds some evidence that BoJ's monetary policy measures during 1998-2010 have had an impact on economic activity but less so on inflation. These results are stronger than those in earlier studies looking at the quantitative easing period up to 2006 and may reflect more effective credit channel as a result of improvements in the banking and corporate sectors. Nevertheless, the relative contribution of monetary policy measures to the variation in output and inflation is rather small.

AB  - The contributors argue that there need not be a trade-off between growth and equity in the long run. However, attempts by government to influence income distribution through large-scale tax and transfer programs can have a negative impact on growth. The contrast is vivid. While the majority of people in the industrial world and some in the developing world enjoy unprecedented affluence, a far greater number of people in the low-income countries live in abject poverty. Although several developing countries are achieving rapid economic growth and poverty reduction, most formerly centrally planned countries are struggling to implement market-oriented reforms in the midst of economic deterioration and rising poverty. The paramount importance of reducing poverty worldwide is forcing economists and policymakers to look at how income distribution and economic growth interact. The essays in this volume grew out of a 1995 conference sponsored by the International Monetary Fund. The contributors are scholars and policymakers from academic institutions, governments, and international organizations. The questions discussed include: How does income distribution interact with economic growth in the short run and the long run? To what extent can government use transfer programs to increase the incomes of the poor? How can government use social programs to help the poor increase their income-earning capacity? Does distributional inequality create an obstacle to long-term poverty reduction? Alternatively, is distributional inequality a necessary means of achieving economic growth? Generally, the contributors agree that there need not be a trade-off between growth and equity in the long run. However, attempts by government to influence income distribution through large-scale tax and transfer programs can have a negative impact on growth.

T2  - Economic Record
AB  - Capital inflow has been depicted in the model developed by Pentti Kouri and Michael Porter as being determined exclusively by monetary forces, with GNP entering the equation through its impact on the demand for money. If this is correct, disaggregation of GNP should have little effect on the estimates of response parameters in the model. It is found that replacing GNP by investment and non-investment spending has a significant effect on the estimates, suggesting that capital inflows have direct purposes which are not well represented in a purely monetary model. An attempt is made to construct a money policy equation as the second part of a simultaneous system depicting the interplay of monetary policy and capital inflow. In spite of claims to the contrary, it is found that simultaneous estimation gives results which differ considerably from those of single-equation methods.

The volatility of economic policy is inherent in its potential for change over the short run. It can take several years before changes are approved and implemented in order to deal with failures in social welfare programmes, transport services, or redistributive taxation provisions. In contrast, the instruments of economic policy may be altered on a daily, monthly, quarterly or yearly basis as conditions change.

AB  - This paper examines whether aggregate stock prices fully incorporated all available information on the money supply in the United States from January 1978 to September 1990, a period that witnessed the deregulation of deposit rates and several changes in the Federal Reserve's short-run operating procedure. A Granger causality test is performed in the context of a bivariate error correction model (ECM) on the monthly data. I find that stock prices did not fully digest and reflect changes in money supply during this period. This phenomenon can be attributed partly to the existence of a relatively volatile relationship between money supply and overall economic activity engendered by financial deregulation.

The determinant of firm-level equity return has been estimated using augmented Fama and French (1992, 1996) multifactor model. The results of the study revealed that firms' stock returns have responded negatively to domestic and international monetary policy shocks. Interestingly, the effect of domestic monetary policy shocks also have differential effects, having a statistically significant impact on small firms' equity returns, but not on large firms' stock returns. The effect of domestic monetary policy shocks also varies according to the subsector of the economy in which firms are operating. The effect of international monetary policy upon equity returns is also heterogeneous by firm size and subsector of economic activity.

AB  - Objective: The study aims to investigate the policy, performed by the main central banks during the crisis, related to spread of the COVID - 19 crisis all over the world. The Central bank’s policy was one of the key policies for the countries to counter the negative effects, from the coming new crisis. The crisis is different in character from the previous global crisis in 2009 and it is characterized with higher negative impacts on the economic activity and unemployment of the countries. Methodology: The study examines s the monetary policy tools used by the major central banks in particular the FR (Federal Reserve), the European central bank, the BoE (Bank of England) during the COVID - 19 crisis. The data used are the official one, published by the Eurostat, European central bank, Federal Reserve, OECD. Through the methods of analysis and synthesis the effectiveness of the monetary policy, done by the covered central banks, is investigated. The data used are for the period 2007 - 2021. Results: The analyses indicate that the Bank of England, as well as the FR was in more privileged terms than the European central bank (ECB) before the COVID - 19 crisis. Their main interest rates were positive, and these banks could apply conventional instruments of policy at the beginning of the crisis before conducting the nonconventional policy tools. Implication: The study’s results are beneficial for central banks for countering the negative effects of the COVID - 19 crisis, turning to the deep economic crisis afterward.

T2  - Journal of Applied Statistics
AB  - The monetary policy targets the short rates; however, during zero interest rate policy (ZIRP), the short end of the yield curve cannot serve as a policy instrument. Relying on the joint yields-macro latent factors model, this study empirically examines the effect of monetary policy stances on term structure and the possible feedback effect on the real sector using the Japanese experience of ZIRP. The analysis indicates that it is the entire term structure that transmits the policy shocks to the real economy rather than the yield spread only. The monetary policy signals pass through the yield curve level and slope factors to stimulate the economic activity. The curvature factor, besides reflecting the cyclical fluctuations of the economy, acts as a leading indicator for future inflation. In addition, policy influence tends to be low as the short end becomes segmented toward medium/long-term of the yield curve. Furthermore, volatility in bond markets is found to be asymmetrically affected by positive and negative shocks and long end tends to be less sensitive to stochastic shocks than the short maturities. The expectation hypothesis of the term structure does not hold during the ZIRP period.

TI  - The Differential Regional Effects of Monetary and Fiscal Policies in Brazil
AU  - Silva, Igor Ézio Maciel
AB  - The aim of this paper is to examine whether monetary and ﬁscal policies have symmetric effects across the regions of Brazil. For this, I use a SVAR model in which a Bayesian sign restrictions approach is adopted to identify the shocks. The results indicate that regional products tend to have similar reactions to monetary policy shocks, but asymmetric responses to ﬁscal policy shocks. Moreover, monetary policy shocks have more inﬂuence on economic activity than ﬁscal policy shocks in all regions.

AU  - Eika, Kari H.

T2  - Oxford Bulletin of Economics and Statistics
AB  - Some recent studies have suggested constructing a Monetary Conditions Index (or MCI) to serve as an indicator of monetary policy stance. The central banks of Canada, Sweden and Norway all construct an MCI and (to varying degrees) use it in conducting monetary policy. Empirically, an MCI is calculated as the weighted sum of changes in a short-term interest rate and the exchange rate relative to values in a baseline year. The weights aim to reflect these variables’ effects on longer-term focuses of policy — economic activity and inflation. This paper derives analytical and empirical properties of MCIs in an attempt to ascertain their usefulness in monetary policy. An MCI assumes an underlying model relating economic activity and inflation to the variables in the MCI. Several issues arise for that model, including its empirical constancy, cointegration, exogeneity, dynamics and potential omitted variables. Because of its structure, the model is unlikely to be constant or to have strongly exogenous variables, yet constancy and exogeneity are critical for the usefulness of an MCI. Empirical analyses of Canadian, Swedish and Norwegian MCIs confirm such difficulties. Thus, the value of an MCI for conduct of economic policy is in doubt.

AB  - This paper proposes a bank-based theoretical model for the credit market that accommodates different types of creditors. The equilibrium relationships between monetary aggregates, credit interest rates and real income are derived from banks' optimizing behavior. This model is used to theoretically establish the effects of a crisis on the bank lending channel and, more specifically, on the equilibrium relationships between the main economic and monetary variables. The model is also used to explore the potential effects of unconventional monetary policies focused on reducing risk aversion during crisis episodes. These effects are empirically assessed applying cointegration techniques to macroeconomic data of the euro area and the United States before and after the collapse of the Lehman Brothers. The results support the efficacy of unconventional measures in restoring the conventional transmission channels between monetary aggregates but shed some doubts on the ability of these measures to boost economic activity.

TI  - Asymmetric Effects of Monetary Policy in the Euro Area
AU  - Horst, Maximilian Julius
AB  - The European Central Bank (ECB) pursues the primary objective of ensuring price stability. According to the ECB's Governing Council, price stability is best maintained by aiming for a symmetric 2% inflation target in the medium term (European Central Bank, 2021a). Considering times of too low inflation rates, the ECB implements conventional expansionary monetary policy by decreasing its short-term monetary policy key interest rates. The intention in doing so is to directly lower commercial banks refinancing costs so that commercial banks pass on their improved refinancing conditions to the real economy resulting in an increase in households' consumption and firms' investment spending and thus in higher credit lending in the economy (European Central Bank, 2002, 2012). Consequently, aggregate demand and thus overall prices in the economy are supposed to increase (traditional interest rate channel of monetary policy).
<br/>
<br/>However, when short-term interest rates have reached the effective lower bound, further interest rate cuts -- and hence also expansionary monetary policy stimuli via the traditional interest rate channel -- are no longer feasible. Then, the ECB introduces unconventional monetary policy instruments to directly reduce longer-term interest rates. In this context, the ECB launched its large-scale asset purchase program, commonly referred to as quantitative easing (QE), in March 2015 to address the risks of a too prolonged period of low, temporarily even negative, inflation rates. When the ECB purchases assets on a large scale, it creates a scarcity of these assets, implying that the respective asset prices increase and yields drop. Long-term interest rates are intended to decrease on a broad scale as a consequence. This should finally trigger economic activity by improving financing conditions for households and firms, and thus increase prices (European Central Bank, 2015).
<br/>
<br/>The ECB's large-scale asset purchases are funded by the creation of new reserves (central bank money). Therefore, as a side effect, the amount of excess liquidity in the euro area banking sector has increased continuously since implementation of the QE program began. In March 2020, the ECB decided to expand its large-scale asset purchases in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. As a consequence, the amount of excess liquidity in the euro area banking sector has continued to increase, reaching unprecedented levels. Moreover, excess liquidity is distributed heterogeneously across euro area member states. The bulk of this liquidity is held by only a few countries. The overall increase in excess liquidity has been accompanied by a similarly strong and heterogeneous increase in TARGET2 balances.
<br/>
<br/>The large quantity of excess liquidity in the euro area banking sector has generated a great amount of concern and debate. However, there has been very little analysis of whether and to what extent large quantities of excess liquidity affect macroeconomic variables (in different countries of a monetary union). Against this background, all three papers of this thesis deal with the consequences of the implementation of the ECB's large-scale asset purchases (QE), especially with large amounts of heterogeneously distributed excess liquidity in the euro area banking sector.

AB  - During the global financial crisis, central banks in Pacific island countries eased monetary policy to stimulate economic activity. Judging by the ensuing movements in commercial bank interest rates and private sector credit, monetary policy transmission appears to be weak. This is confirmed by an empirical examination of interest rate pass-through and credit growth. Weak credit demand and under-developed financial markets seem to have limited the effectiveness of monetary policy, but the inflexibility of exchange rates and rising real interest rates have also served to frustrate the central banks' efforts despite a supporting fiscal policy. While highlighting the importance of developing domestic financial markets in the long run, this experience also points to the need to coordinate macroeconomic policies and to use all macroeconomic tools available in conducting countercyclical policies, including exchange rate flexibility.

Second, we measure wealth inequality within US states and document that economic activity responds more strongly to interest rate changes in states where wealth is distributed more unequally. Third, we show that ECB monetary policy has stronger real effects in Euro Area countries with higher wealth inequality.

Discussion of teh day-to-day management of the standard levers of fiscal and monetary policy is interlinked with consideration for the more deep-seated structural issues. By shifting and destabilizing the underlying economic relationships and creating uncertainty, structural change complicates the task of policy analysis. This volume describes how the IMF is responding to these challenges and how outside experts assess this effect.

AB  - In this paper we study the joint behavior of the federal funds rate and 10-year TIPS yields before the start of the financial crisis in 2007. We make three points. First, the decade before the crisis was characterized by a collapse in the yield on TIPS. Second, estimated VARs for the federal funds rate and the TIPS yield show that while monetary policy shocks had negligible effects on the TIPS yield, shocks to the latter had one-to-one effects on the federal funds rate. Third, these findings can be rationalized in a New Keynesian model.

AB  - Along this dissertation, I carry out a broad analysis of monetary policy in Mexico during
the last two decades. Specifically, I investigate the impact of a contractionary monetary
policy on bank credit to the private sector, as well as on regional and sectoral economic
activity. In very general terms, I find that following a monetary tightening, firms bank loans
tend to increase, which is considered a perverse reaction of bank credit or the “loan puzzle”.
Furthermore, I find that, in the Mexican southern region, a region with the lowest integration
with the financial sector, economic activity does not respond following a monetary tightening.
In co-authorship with Dr. Victor Valcarcel, we produce the first Divisia Index for the Money
Supply in Mexico. By using such index, we aggregate the different monetary assets, weighting
by their differences in liquidity degrees.

We use a Bayesian VAR framework (BVAR) to provide an analysis of the COVID-19 uncertainty shock on the economy and monetary policy response. This analysis shows important conclusions. The uncertainty effect of COVID-19 hits unprecedented aggregate demand and the economy. In addition, it undermines monetary policy action to soften this fall in aggregate demand and curb inflation impacted by the exchange rate effect. We suggest a development of unconventional devices for a gradual recovery of the economy.

TI  - MONETARY POLICY IN NIGERIA AND THE ECONOMIC CRISIS OF THE 1980s
AU  - Aigbokhan, Ben E.
T2  - African Review of Money Finance and Banking
AB  - The Nigerian economy experienced "economic crisis" situation in the 80s, due initially to some "external shocks", largely from the industrialised economies. In attempts to tackle the problems created by the initial recession, monetary and fiscal policies were adopted, first under the Economic Stabilisation Measures, then under the National Economic Emergency measures, and lately under the Structural Adjustment Programmes. In an exercise at appraising these policies, the St. Louis model was adopted in this paper as a useful framework. Applying the model to the period 1970-89 it was found that monetary policy has not only tended to be less effective in revamping and stimulating the economy out of the economic depression, it has also tended to exacerbate the depression. In the light of this there is obviously a case for making monetary policy less restrictive if it is to serve as a means of reviving the economy.

AB  - We develop a structural vector autoregressive framework that combines external instruments and heteroskedasticity for identification of monetary policy shocks. We show that exploiting both types of information sharpens structural inference, allows testing the relevance and exogeneity condition for instruments separately using likelihood ratio tests, and facilitates the economic interpretation of the structural shock of interest. We test alternative instruments and find that narrative and model-based measures are valid, while high-frequency data instruments show signs of invalidity. Finally, we document that monetary shocks identified with both a valid instrument and heteroskedasticity have larger effects on production and prices than monetary shocks identified via an instrument only.

TI  - How would monetary policy matter in the proposed African monetary unions? Evidence from output and prices
AU  - Simplice, Asongu
T2  - Working Papers of the African Governance and Development Institute.
AB  - We analyze the effects of monetary policy on economic activity in the proposed African monetary unions. Findings broadly show that: (1) but for financial efficiency in the EAMZ, monetary policy variables affect output neither in the short-run nor in the long-term and; (2) with the exception of financial size that impacts inflation in the EAMZ in the short-term, monetary policy variables generally have no effect on prices in the short-run. The WAMZ may not use policy instruments to offset adverse shocks to output by pursuing either an expansionary or a contractionary policy, while the EAMZ can do with the ‘financial allocation efficiency’ instrument. Policy implications are discussed.

TI  - Mitigating COVID-19 Effects with Conventional Monetary Policy
AU  - Cúrdia, Vasco
AB  - The Federal Reserve slashed the federal funds rate in response to the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. The full impact of the pandemic on the economy is still uncertain and depends on many factors. Analysis suggests that allowing the federal funds rate to fall fast will help the economy cope with the aftermath of COVID-19. In particular, the limited policy space due to the effective lower bound of the federal funds rate before the pandemic reinforces rather than offsets the need for a rapid funds rate decline.

TI  - Monetary policy and U.S. long-term interest rates: How close are the linkages?
AU  - Berument, Hakan
AU  - Froyen, Richard
T2  - Journal of Economics and Business
AB  - The effect of monetary policy on long-term interest rates has been a question of interest in recent years. A number of papers, relying on single-equation estimation techniques, have presented evidence that long-term interest rates exhibit sizable and significant responses to unanticipated changes in the Federal Reserve's target federal funds rate. This paper examines these findings in light of conflicting findings from VAR studies, which indicate negligible effects of innovations in the federal funds rate on long-term rates. To address the issue we use a single-equation approach where unanticipated changes in the federal funds rate are measured as residuals from policy reaction functions. We also estimate VAR specifications, which incorporate information about the timing of changes in the Federal Reserve's target federal funds rate. Our single-equation estimates provide evidence of strong responses of long rates to unanticipated changes in the federal funds rate both for the Greenspan period and for a longer period back to the mid-1960s. It seems likely that estimated VARs for the post-1987 years are less successful in isolating monetary policy surprises than was the case for earlier years.

AU  - Smales, L. A.

T2  - Journal of Banking & Finance
AB  - Monetary policy announcements have a significant impact on financial market liquidity. This study provides a novel perspective on the factors driving this relationship in the market for 10-year Treasury note futures: Target rate surprises and the complexity of the monetary policy statement language are important determinants. Differences of opinion resulting from interpretation of complex language appear to result in more trading volume despite relatively low levels of liquidity (a negative liquidity-volume relationship), while large target rate surprises reduce trading activity (a positive liquidity-volume relationship). The dynamic changes over time, as unconventional polices are adopted by monetary authorities and, high frequency traders become more pervasive. Central bankers may aid market liquidity by minimizing surprises, and issuing statements that are easier to understand (with shorter sentences and more familiar words).

TI  - THE REAL ECONOMIC EFFECTS OF MONETARY POLICY: CONSIDERING ASSET PRICES AND HOUSEHOLD DEBT
AU  - Thordenberg, Erik
AB  - Cycles in economic activity and assets pricing are a recurrent theme in economics. Throughout
the twentieth century there has been a debate regarding the role of monetary policy in the creation and
prevention of real economic shocks. The purpose of this thesis is to model the response in Swedish
real economic activity to changes in monetary policy, accounting for asset pricing and debt growth.
Such a model is useful for policymakers to assess the impact of policy changes on real economic
stability. To answer this question both a traditional structural vector autoregressive, SVAR, and the
more recent local projection, LP, estimation technique is used. The results indicate that when using
LP, repo rate increases tend to yield negative real economic growth approximately two years after a
policy shock when taking asset prices and debt into account The estimates from SVAR corroborate
the results of the LP technique, but yield overall statistically insignificant results.

AB  - In this paper we investigate the effects of monetary policy shocks on economic activity in China using a variety of Bayesian VARs. We using a variety of Bayesian VAR specifications including alternative priors and steady-state Priors. In addition we specify an underlying economic model for the long-run which applies to non-stationary data where we allow for time-varying equilibrium on the steady-state using a simulation smoother for latent processes. We show the implications for understanding China's Business Cycle. We show that monetary policy shocks have a significant effect on economic activity. The models also show that tight monetary policy was one of the key drivers of the growth slowdown since 2012. These findings are robust across both different interest rates and different model specifications. Looking ahead, we show that that a further slowdown of the Chinese economy can be expected when we impose a tight prior on the steady-state of the model and monetary policy is only partially off-setting the slowdown.

TI  - EBSCOhost | 161537214 | Monetary Conditions Index and Economic Activity in Dollarized Zimbabwe.
AB  - Purpose: Zimbabwe has experienced a chronic inflationary crisis whose roots can be traced back to 1997. Various macroeconomic instruments have been suggested to stabilize the country's prices and foster economic growth but evidence on how they interplay to influence policy is lacking. This study developed a monetary conditions index (MCI) for Zimbabwe during the 10-year dollarization period, 2009 to 2018, and measured its correlation with economic activity. The aim of the MCI is to inform monetary policy making in Zimbabwe. Design/methodology/approach: Using monthly time series data, the MCI series from 2009 to 2018 was calculated using real interest rates and exchange rates. The relationship between the MCI, GDP, inflation, money supply and private sector credit was analysed using the Auto Regressive Distributed Lag (ARDL) model for the long-term relationship and Granger causality for the short term. Findings: Results showed MCI weights of 1:1.54 implying that exchange rates dominate the interest rate in Zimbabwe's monetary policy. A long run relationship between the MCI and economic variables was statistically significant while short term relationships were established for private sector credit, GDP, and foreign interest rates. Research implications: The study concludes that the MCI is a useful indicator of the central bank's monetary policy position for economic analysts while the central bank can also adopt it for inflation and growth targeting. Originality/value: Unlike previous research which has proffered monetary solutions based on specific variables, this study took into consideration the interplay between interest rates and exchange rates in determining economic activity in Zimbabwe. The constructed MCI captured the interplay between these two key variables and the study established its relationship with economic activity. On this basis, the study recommends the adoption of the MCI in guiding monetary policy in Zimbabwe.

TI  - Optimal Monetary Policy Under Sudden Stops
AU  - Cúrdia, Vasco
AB  - Emerging market economies often face sudden stops in capital inflows or reduced access to the international capital market, a development that can cause serious disruptions in economic activity. This paper analyzes what monetary policy can accomplish in such an event. Optimal monetary policy exploits export revenues to minimize the impact on the domestic economy. However, this approach will not completely insulate the economy from some contraction. Domestic currency depreciation combined with high interest rates is needed to achieve this result. The paper shows that the arrival of the sudden stop further aggravates the time inconsistency problem. Optimal policy is fairly well approximated by a flexible targeting rule, which stabilizes a basket composed of domestic price inflation, exchange rate, and output. For some parameterizations, the best rule can be specified as an interest rate rule that responds to the natural interest rate, inflation, output, and exchange rate depreciation. We further show that from a welfare perspective, the desirability of a fixed exchange rate regime depends on the economic environment.

AB  - This note considers the international transmission of monetary policy conditions to emerging market economies (EMEs) with a focus on Brazil’s experience. The main points are as follows: (i) growing foreign participation in Brazil’s domestic Treasury markets has increased the sensitivity of the long end of the yield curve to global factors; (ii) the role of foreign factors in the term spread of most EMEs is growing in importance, but domestic factors still account for most of the variation; (iii) unconventional monetary policy in advanced economies (AEs) impacts asset prices and economic activity in EMEs, with capital inflows an important transmission channel; (iv) the prospect of tapering amplified asset price volatility, and interventions with swap instruments – backed by international reserves – are an effective way to cope with hedging demand; and (v) macroprudential instruments, including capital flow regulation and liquidity buffers, are effective in reducing financial instability associated with global factors.

TI  - Macroeconomic Consequences of Diﬀerent Types of Credit Market Disturbances and Non-Conventional Monetary Policy in the Euro Area
AU  - Peersman, Gert
AB  - I estimate the eﬀects of diﬀerent types of credit market disturbances on the euro area economy since the introduction of the euro, i.e. exogenous credit demand shocks, innovations to the credit multiplier (e.g. shocks to risk taking by banks, securitization or ﬁnancial innovations such as credit risk transfer instruments) and monetary policy shocks. In a second step, monetary policy shocks are further decomposed into traditional interest rate innovations and non-conventional policy actions. Overall, the macroeconomic relevance is considerable. Credit market disturbances account together for more than half of output variation and up to 75 percent of long-run inﬂation variability. The majority of these eﬀects are driven by shocks to the credit multiplier. I further show that the dynamic eﬀects crucially depend on the underlying source of the disturbance. Whereas surges in credit caused by innovations to the credit multiplier have a signiﬁcant positive impact on economic activity and inﬂation, exactly the opposite is the case for exogenous credit demand shocks. Finally, both types of monetary policy instruments can inﬂuence the economy. The ultimate consequences on output and consumer prices are however more sluggish for non-standard policy measures, and the transmission mechanism via ﬁnancial institutions - very likely the risk-taking channel - is diﬀerent.

AB  - We study the transmission of conventional monetary policy in China, focusing on the interaction between monetary and fiscal policy given the unique institutional set-up for macroeconomic policy making. Our results suggest some progress but also continued difficulties in the transmission of monetary policy. Similar to recent studies, we find evidence of monetary policy pass-through to interest rates. However, the impact of monetary policy measures that are not coordinated with fiscal policy is significantly weaker than that of coordinated measures. This suggests the need for further improvements to the interest-rate based framework.

T2  - Empirical Economics
AB  - We test whether the credit channel of the monetary policy was present in the United States’ economy from January 2001 to April 2016. To this end, we use a factor-augmented vector autoregression, and we impose sensible theoretical sign restrictions in our structural identification scheme. We use the expected substitution effect between bank commercial loans and commercial papers to identify the credit supply channel. We found that the credit channel appears to have operated in the US economy during the sample period. However, when we split the sample, we found that the credit channel did not operate after the subprime crisis (close to the Zero Lower Bound of the interest rate). This result is robust to changing the sign restriction horizons. It supports current views in the literature regarding the ineffectiveness of the credit channel as a means to foster real economic activity during crises episodes.

The empirical analysis has been conducted by using the technique of Ordinary Least Square using annual data for the period from 1971-72 to 2006-07. Before applying OLS the stationarity of the data was checked by Augmented Dickey Fuller (ADF) test. Regression analysis proves that both cost-push and monetary factors are influenced on wholesale price index. The monetary variables have significant impact on GDP deflator.. There is no single remedy to control the raise of wholesale price index. Government should adopt multipurpose strategy such as improvement in tax and revenue structure, improving fiscal and monetary discipline, removing supply side disruptions, eradication of anti-competitive market practice.

AB  - This paper constructs a quarterly series of GDP deflator inflation for China from 1979 to 2009 and tests for a structural break with an unknown change point in the dynamic inflation process. Empirical results suggest a significant structural change in inflation persistence. Employing a counterfactual simulation method, we show that the structural change is primarily attributed to better conduct of monetary policy and the resultant better anchored inflation expectations. This finding implies that the quiescence of inflation in China over the past decade could well be followed by a return to a high inflation era in the absence of a determined effort by the monetary authorities in managing inflation expectations. Therefore, the use of a preemptive monetary policy to anchor inflationary expectations and to keep inflation moderate is warranted in China.

AB  - This paper evaluates the distributive effect of monetary policy in the case of the UK. The income inequality measure represents the whole income distribution. Different income inequality data sources and sample periods are considered. The monetary policy shock is identified by using recursive, sign restrictions, and high frequency methods. The results indicate that contractionary monetary policy decreases income inequality. This effect is also explored through the different distribution channels of monetary policy. In this respect, our results suggest that the stronger negative effect of contractionary monetary policy on business and financial income than on labor earnings leads to the overall reduction of income inequality. This evaluation of the distributive impact of monetary policy can be useful for the development of macroeconomic policies designed to reduce income inequality.

T2  - Handbook of Monetary Policy
AB  - Economists disagree about the exact linkages among monetary policy actions, inflation, and economic activity. Most agree that banks play a critical role in the transmission process, although evidence is inconclusive about whether it is through the liability side of banks’ balance sheets or through the asset side. Aggregate spending is related not to market interest rates but to the expected real rate of interest. Aggregate spending is related both to long-term real interest rates and to the short-term rates the Fed can affect directly. Long-term interest rates can be expressed as the sum of an expected real return and an adjustment for expected inflation. The Fed has no single reliable intermediate target that could be used to guide policy; consequently, the Fed must rely on many variables for information to guide policy. The conduct of monetary policy often consists of balancing inconsistent goals using sometimes unreliable indicators to manipulate tools whose effects on the economy are uncertain.

Using nonlinear impulseresponse functions, we evaluate the dynamics implied by the threshold model. These suggest that shocks have a larger effect on output in the ''tight'' credit regime than is normally the case, and that contractionary monetary shocks typically have a larger effect than expansionary shocks. Finally, using a nonlinear version of historical decompositions, we attempt to determine the relative contribution to output growth of shocks and the nonlinear structure.

TI  - Inflation, Employment, and Monetary Policy: Objectives and Outcomes in the UK and U.S. Compared
AU  - Miles, David

AB  - This paper explores how sensitive is monetary policy to the precise preferences of the central bank over inflation and economic activity. It does so in order to address a puzzle—which is that the U.S. Fed and the Bank of England appear to have quite different objectives and yet have adopted strikingly similar policies in recent years. I use a calibrated model to assess how policy might be sensitive to attaching different weights to inflation, output, and the output gap in central bank objectives. I find that a wide range of weights can give rise to rather similar monetary policies.

TI  - Informal financial transactions and monetary policy in low-income countries : interpolated informal credit and interest rates in Malawi
AU  - Ngalawa, Harold
T2  - South African Journal of Economic and Management Sciences
AB  - Background: Official monetary data usually exclude informal financial transactions although the informal financial sector (IFS) forms a large part of the financial sector in low-income countries. Aim and setting: Excluding informal financial transactions in official monetary data, however, underestimates the volume of financial transactions and incorrectly presents the cost of credit, bringing into question the accuracy of expected effects of monetary policy on economic activity. Methods: Using IFS data for Malawi constructed from two survey data sets, indigenous knowledge and elements of Friedman’s data interpolation technique, this study employs innovation accounting in a structural vector autoregressive model to compare monetary policy outcomes when IFS data are taken into account and when they are not. Results: The study finds evidence that in certain instances, the formal and informal financial sectors complement each other. For example, it is observed that the rate of inflation as well as output increase following a rise in either formal financial sector (FFS) or IFS lending. Further investigation reveals that in other cases, the FFS and IFS work in conflict with each other. Demonstrating this point, the study finds that a rise in FFS interest rates is followed by a decline in FFS lending while IFS lending does not respond significantly and the response of FFS and IFS loans combined is insignificant. When IFS interest rates are raised, total loans decline significantly. Conclusion: The study, therefore, concludes that exclusion of IFS transactions from official monetary data has the potential to frustrate monetary policy through wrong inferences on the impact of monetary policy on economic activity.

TI  - Japan's Great Stagnation: Financial and Monetary Policy Lessons for Advanced Economies
AU  - Hutchison, Michael M.
AU  - Westermann, Frank
AB  - Experts on the Japanese economy examine Japan's prolonged period of economic underperformance, analyzing the ways in which the financial system, monetary policy, and international financial factors contributed to its onset and duration. After experiencing spectacular economic growth and industrial development for much of the postwar era, Japan plunged abruptly into recession in the early 1990s and since then has suffered a prolonged period of economic stagnation, from which it is only now emerging. Japan's malaise, marked by recession or weak economic activity, commodity and asset price deflation, banking failures, increased bankruptcies, and rising unemployment, has been the most sustained economic downturn seen in the industrial world since the 1930s. In Japan's Great Stagnation, experts on the Japanese economy consider key questions about the causes and effects of Japan's prolonged period of economic underperformance and what other advanced economies might learn from Japan's experience. They focus on aspects of the financial and banking system that have contributed to economic stagnation, the role of monetary policy, and the importance of international financial factors--in particular, the exchange rate and the balance of payments. Among the topics discussed are bank fragility and the inaccuracy of measuring it by the "Japan premium," the consequences of weak banking regulation, the controversial policy of "quantitative easing," and the effectiveness of currency devaluation for fighting deflation. Taken together, the contributions demonstrate the importance of a sound financial sector in fostering robust growth and healthy economies--and the enormous economic costs of a dysfunctional financial system.

TI  - The Phenomenon of Lag in Application of the Measures of Monetary Policy
AU  - Jovanovski, Tihomir

T2  - Economic Research-Ekonomska Istraživanja
AB  - This paper discusses the theoretical aspect of the phenomenon of lag in the application of the measures of monetary policy. Monetary and fiscal policy faces the phenomenon of lag. One of the controversial and pressing questions of monetary policy is the nature and length of lag between the application of the measures of monetary policy and the effects on macroeconomic aggregates. While the monetary strategy points to several possible reasons for the lag, there is no general agreement on the length of the lag. The study of the phenomenon of lag imposes two questions: what does the lag of the application of monetary processes and policy imply and why are the asset holders not capable of immediately adjusting their portfolios at the time of disbalance? There are two categories of lag known in economic literature: the inside lag (which encompasses the recognition of the problem and the implementation of measures) and the outside lag (which encompasses the reaction of macroeconomic aggregates to the applied measures of monetary policy). The paper descriptively notes the different identifications of time lag and provides schematic representations of the effects of the observed phenomenon.
