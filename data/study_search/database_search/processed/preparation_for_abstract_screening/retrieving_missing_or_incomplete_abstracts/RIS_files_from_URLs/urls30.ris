TI  - Effects of fiscal and monetary policy uncertainty on economic activity in South Africa
AU  - Aye, Goodness Chioma
AB  - The paper examines the effect of fiscal and monetary policies on economic activities in South
Africa while attempting to identify the role of uncertainty. The paper uses quarterly time series
data using the variables of income tax, consumption tax, capital tax, and government expenditure
to measure fiscal policy uncertainty while interest and inflation rate variables were used to measure
monetary policy uncertainty. Also, real gross domestic product, real consumption, real investment,
and employment were used to measure economic activities. The partial least squares structural
equation model (PLS-SEM) was used for analysis and result presented for measurement and
structural models. Results revealed the existence of policy uncertainty in the South African
economy which tends to reduce the level of economic activity as uncertainty increases. This result
informs of the need for policy makers to minimally reduce uncertainties for both fiscal and
monetary policies for the economy to improve.

TI  - The transmission mechanism of monetary policy in Japan: Evidence from banks' balance sheets
AU  - Hosono, Kaoru
T2  - Journal of the Japanese and International Economies
AB  - We examine how banks' responses to monetary policy vary according to their balance sheet using Japanese bank data from 1975 to 1999. We find that the effect of monetary policy on lending is stronger for banks that are smaller, less liquid, and more abundant with capital. The effects of bank balance sheet on monetary transmission are different by bank types, policy stances and borrowers' industries. Our results imply that a lending channel of monetary transmission exists, that the effect of expansionary monetary policy is attenuated if banks' capital is scarce, and that the effect of monetary policy on the allocation of funds depends on banks' balance sheets.

TI  - A Natural Quasi-Experiment of the Monetary Policy Shocks on the Housing Markets of New Zealand during COVID-19
AU  - Yiu, Chung Yim
T2  - Journal of Risk and Financial Management
AB  - It is hard to experimentally test the impacts of monetary policy shocks on housing markets as it is very unlikely for a central bank to change monetary policies swiftly twice within a short period of time for exogenous reasons. However, during the pandemic, the central bank of New Zealand changed its policies 180 degree in 2 years, from an unprecedented low interest rate and a relaxed mortgage policy in 2020 to a 13-year record high interest rate and a tightened mortgage policy in 2022. Among the OECD members, New Zealand is the country that increased the interest rate the earliest and also the country that had its house prices fall the earliest. It provides natural quasi-experiments to test the monetary policy hypothesis empirically by the two policy changes as treatments on house prices. This study conducts a time series regression analysis on the housing markets of New Zealand to test the hypothesis in the pre-COVID and the COVID periods, ranging from 2016 Q2 to 2022 Q3. The results confirm that mortgage rates have a negative and significant effect on house price changes after controlling for the economic growth factor and the housing supply factor, no matter whether the monetary policy switches to expansionary or contractionary mode. The robustness test results of the housing markets show that a 1% fall/rise in the mortgage rate caused a 5.6% increase/decrease in house prices, ceteris paribus, in the COVID period. The results also do not support the housing supply hypothesis in New Zealand.

AU  - Van Nieuwerburgh, Stijn
AB  - Governments around the world have gone on a massive fiscal expansion in response to the Covid crisis, increasing government debt to levels not seen in 75 years. How will this debt be repaid? What role do conventional and unconventional monetary policy play? We investigate debt sustainability in a New Keynesian model with an intermediary sector, realistic fiscal and monetary policy, endogenous convenience yields, and substantial risk premia. When conventional monetary policy is constrained by the ZLB during an economic crisis, increased government spending and lower tax revenue lead to a large rise in government debt and raise the risk of future tax increases. We find that quantitative easing (QE), forward guidance, and an expansion in government discretionary spending all contribute to lowering debt/GDP ratio and reducing this fiscal risk. A transitory QE policy deployed during a crisis stimulates aggregate demand.

TI  - Relative price effects of monetary policy shock in Malaysia: a svar study
AU  - Abdul Karim, Zulkefly

AU  - W. N.W, Azman-Saini
AB  - Studies on Malaysia monetary policy mostly examine the effect of monetary policy change on output and inflation in aggregate terms.  While sectoral output effects of monetary policy have also been investigated, there is however a lack in the study on the effect of policy change on disaggregated inflation. This paper attempts to examine the later issue by employing structural vector autoregressive (SVAR) model. By estimating the model separately for each sub-group of Malaysian consumer price index, we find that a modest monetary policy shock results in varying degree of responses in disaggregated inflation. In other words, some sub-group inflation react instantly while others respond sluggishly to a monetary policy shock. In contrast to aggregate inflation response, there is also evidence of price puzzle. The results give some insight to monetary authority on how to control inflation in aggregate as well as in disaggregate terms and in turn manage the cost of living issues in Malaysia.

TI  - Effects of Monetary Policy on Housing Price Fluctuations:Evidence from China's Big-to-Medium-Sized Cities
AU  - Lei, Tianli
AU  - Wu, Gang
AB  - It is important for macro policy makers to make clear what monetary policy instruments are significant to control housing prices. According to China's 35 big-to-medium-sized cities' average house price index spans from 2000Q1 to 2012Q3, this paper applies log-linear regression and dummy variable analysis to study the impact on the money supply, mortgage interest rates, credit and GDP on housing prices. Empirical analysis shows that credit is the most important factor affecting housing prices. GDP has a positive effect, while mortgage interest rates do not have significant effect on house prices. Though the money supply does not have a positive effect in the long run, it can positively affect house prices in the short run. Hence, the best way to control China's house pricing is to control the scale of credit.

For 24 OECD economies, we estimate time-varying Bayesian VARs and compute the time-varying impulse response functions of GDP to monetary shocks. We analyze the production network structure using specific network measures. When looking at the relationship between the production networks measures and the impact of monetary policy shocks on GDP, upstreamness and downstreamness are found significant. We also identify an amplifying role for real estate and the financial intermediation sectors.

AB  - This paper identifies a monetary policy channel through the risk pricing of bank debt in the market for jumbo certificates of deposit (jumbo CDs). Adverse policy shocks increase debt holder perceptions of bank default, increasing the risk premia for some banks, thereby decreasing their external funding of loans. The results show that contractionary policy increases the sensitivity of jumbo-CD spreads to leverage and asset risk for small banks, and to leverage for large banks. The results also show a distributional and aggregate effect on banking system jumbo CDs and total loans, producing a risk-pricing (or market discipline) channel. This channel has implications for monetary and regulatory policies, and financial stability.

AB  - The study investigates the relationship between monetary policy and bank profitability in New Zealand using the generalized method of moments (GMM) estimator. Our sample comprises 19 banks from New Zealand over the period 2006–2018. Our results suggest that an increase in short-term rate leads to an increase in the profitability of banks, while an increase in long-term interest rates reduces bank profitability. In addition to monetary policy variables, capital adequacy ratio, non-performing loan ratio, and cost to income ratio are also important determinants of the profitability of banks in New Zealand. Capital adequacy ratio has a positive impact on bank profitability, while non-performing loan ratio and cost to income ratio have a negative impact on bank profitability.

AB  - Is monetary policy more powerful when strains in the financial system are high? Applying local projections to US time series, I approach this question by allowing monetary policy shocks and its propagation to the broader economy to smoothly vary according to a measure of financial market tensions—the so-called excess bond premium (EBP). I find that monetary policy impacts macroeconomic, housing, and financial variables stronger and more persistently when financial frictions are high.

AB  - We study the risk-taking channel of monetary policy in Bolivia, a dollarized country where monetary changes are transmitted exogenously from the USA. We find that a lower policy rate spurs the granting of riskier loans, to borrowers with worse credit histories, lower ex-ante internal ratings, and weaker ex-post performance (acutely so when the rate subsequently increases). Effects are stronger for small firms borrowing from multiple banks. To uniquely identify risk-taking, we assess collateral coverage, expected returns, and risk premia of the newly granted riskier loans, finding that their returns and premia are actually lower, especially at banks suffering from agency problems.

TI  - A half-century diversion of monetary policy? An empirical horse-race to identify the UK variable most likely to deliver the desired nominal GDP growth rate
AU  - Ryan-Collins, Josh
AU  - Werner, Richard A.
AU  - Castle, Jennifer
T2  - Journal of International Financial Markets, Institutions and Money
AB  - The financial crisis of 2007–2008 triggered monetary policy designed to boost nominal demand, including ‘Quantitative Easing’, ‘Credit Easing’, ‘Forward Guidance’ and ‘Funding for Lending’. A key aim of these policies was to boost the quantity of bank credit to the non-financial corporate and household sectors. In the previous decades, however, policy-makers had not focused on bank credit. Indeed, over the past half century, different variables were raised to prominence in the quest to achieve desired nominal GDP outcomes. This paper conducts a long-overdue horse race between the various contenders in terms of their ability to account for observed nominal GDP growth, using a half-century of UK data since 1963. Employing the ‘General-to-Specific’ methodology, an equilibrium-correction model is estimated suggesting a long-run cointegrating relationship between disaggregated real economy credit and nominal GDP. Short-term and long-term interest rates and broad money do not appear to influence nominal GDP significantly. Vector autoregression and vector error correction modelling shows the real economy credit growth variable to be strongly exogenous to nominal GDP growth. Policy-makers are hence right to finally emphasise the role of bank credit, although they need to disaggregate it and specifically target bank credit for GDP-transactions.

We utilized the panel and time series NARDL approach to explore the long-run and short-run estimates at a regional level and country level. ASEAN regional-wise analysis shows that contractionary monetary policy reduces the CO2 emissions, while expansionary monetary policy enhances CO2 emissions in the long run. The long-run coefficient further confirms that expansionary fiscal policy mitigates CO2 emissions in ASEAN. The impact of expansionary monetary and fiscal policy on CO2 emissions is positive and significant, while contractionary monetary and fiscal policy have an insignificant impact on CO2 emissions in the short run. ASEAN country-wise analysis also reported the country-specific estimates for the short and long run. Some policies can redesign in light of these novel findings in ASEAN economies.

AB  - The recovery from the Global Financial Crisis was characterized by sluggish output growth and by inflation remaining persistently below the inflation targets of central banks in many advanced economies despite an unprecedented monetary expansion. Ten years after the Global Financial Crisis, GDP remains below its pre-crisis trend in many economies and interest rates continue to be very low. This raises the question of whether low GDP growth and low interest rates are a temporary phenomenon or are due to a decline in long-run growth prospects (potential output growth) and equilibrium real interest rates (natural interest rate). Addressing this question is important for central banks for conducting monetary policy and adjusting their strategy. In this paper, the authors address this question based on a review of the literature and an evaluation of the most recent data and discuss implications for monetary policy.

T2  - Journal of Banking & Finance
AB  - This paper compares the distributional effects of conventional monetary policy and quantitative easing (QE) within an estimated open-economy DSGE model of the euro area. The model includes two groups of households: (i) wealthier households, who own financial assets and are able to smooth consumption over time, and (ii) poorer households, who only receive labor and transfer income and live `hand to mouth'. We use the model to compare the impact of policy shocks on constructed measures of income and wealth inequality (net disposable income, net asset position, and relative per-capita income). Except for the short term, expansionary conventional policy and QE shocks tend to mitigate income and wealth inequality between the two population groups. In light of the coarse dichotomy of households that abstracts from richer income and wealth dynamics at the individual level, the analysis emphasizes the functional distribution of income.

We use a nonlinear model, the multiple regime smooth transition autoregressive model, that allows the effects of shocks to vary across the business cycles when monetary innovations modify both the endogenous and state variables. Our impulse response functions show a history-dependence property. Indeed, hitting the economy at a given time induces persistence and asymmetric responses across histories and shocks. The empirical application concerns the US over the period 1975:1–1998:2.

T2  - Discussion Paper
AB  - We investigate the impact of the stance and path of monetary policy on the level of credit risk of individual bank loans and on lending standards. We employ the Credit Register of the Bank of Spain that contains detailed monthly information on virtually all loans granted by all credit institutions operating in Spain during the last twenty-two years – generating almost twenty-three million bank loan records in total. Spanish monetary conditions were exogenously determined during the entire sample period. Using a variety of duration models we find that lower short-term interest rates prior to loan origination result in banks granting more risky new loans. Banks also soften their lending standards – they lend more to borrowers with a bad credit history and with high uncertainty. Lower interest rates, by contrast, reduce the credit risk of outstanding loans. Loan credit risk is maximized when both interest rates are very low prior to loan origination and interest rates are very high over the life of the loan. Our results suggest that low interest rates increase bank risk-taking, reduce credit risk in banks in the very short run but worsen it in the medium run. Risk-taking is not equal for all type of banks: Small banks, banks with fewer lending opportunities, banks with less sophisticated depositors, and savings or cooperative banks take on more extra risk than other banks when interest rates are lower. Higher GDP growth reduces credit risk on both new and outstanding loans, in stark contrast to the differential effects of monetary policy.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small><br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small><br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small><br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small><br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small><br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>

TI  - An analysis of involuntary excess reserves, monetary policy and risk-taking behaviour of Chinese Banks
AU  - Nguyen, Vu Hong Thai

T2  - International Review of Financial Analysis
AB  - In this paper, we examine the effects of monetary policy on the risk-taking behaviour of Chinese banks in the presence of involuntary excess reserves based on a sample of 95 banks. We find that involuntary excess reserves lead to more aggressive risk-taking suggesting that large involuntary excess reserves stimulate the rapid expansion of credit and the price bubble in the Chinese financial market. However, banks with larger involuntary excess reserves tend to reduce risk-taking more rapidly under the tightening monetary policy regime. The paper sheds light on the effectiveness of government monetary policy in reducing the risk-taking behaviour of banks in an emerging market where involuntary excess reserves are present.

TI  - UK QE reconsidered: the real economy effects of monetary policy in the UK, 1990-2012 – an empirical analysis
AU  - Bernardo, Giovanni
AU  - Ryan-Collins, Josh
AU  - Werner, Richard A.
AB  - Empirical studies of so called ‘unconventional’ monetary policy – ‘Quantitative Easing’ or ‘Large Scale Asset Purchases’ - since the North Atlantic Financial Crisis of 2007-2009 in the United Kingdom and elsewhere have mainly focussed on the effect of policy on intermediate variables rather than the stated ultimate goal of such policies, boosting nominal demand and GDP growth. Secondly and relatedly they tend to focus on the crisis and post-crisis period, a time of extraordinary economic and financial dislocation, which creates counterfactual and attribution problems and fails to capture typical macroeconomic lag dynamics. Adopting the approach of Voutsinas and Werner (2010), and building on Lyonnet and Werner’s (2012) study of UK QE, this paper addresses these weaknesses by 1) examining the impact of various different monetary policy instruments (including Quantitative Easing) directly on UK nominal GDP growth; and 2) using a quarterly time series beginning in the first quarter of 1990 and up to the last quarter of 2012 (92 observations in total). We use the Hendry ‘general-to-specific’ econometric methodology to estimate a parsimonious model. The results show that disaggregated bank credit to the real economy (households and firms) has the most significant impact on nominal GDP growth. Changes to the central bank’s interest rate, central bank reserves, and total central bank asset ratios drop out of the model as insignificant. The policy implication it that, as private banks continue to shrink their balance sheets in the UK and Europe following the North Atlantic Crisis of 2008, central banks might wish to consider ‘unconventional’ monetary policies that more directly boost credit to the real economy and thus nominal GDP growth

TI  - Will digital financial development affect the effectiveness of monetary policy in emerging market countries?
AU  - Jiang, Song

T2  - Economic Research-Ekonomska Istraživanja
AB  - Whether digital finance should be included in the quantitative framework of monetary policy in emerging market countries has been widely discussed by scholars. However, the current research just focused on a single format of digital finance, lacking comprehensive analysis at the overall level and the refinement of general rules. Therefore, this paper constructed a spatial econometric model to empirically analyze the impact of digital finance on the effectiveness of monetary policy and its heterogeneity, taking China as the representative of emerging market countries. The empirical test showed that (1) Although the total index of digital finance had a negative impact on economic growth, the interaction between digital finance and monetary policy was significantly positive. This indicated that the “moderating effect” of monetary policy was beneficial to digital finance in promoting economic growth, which was confirmed from the subindexes level as well. (2) The development of digital finance had obvious characteristics of the “polarization effect” and the “spatial spillover effect”. Meanwhile, there was a significant regional difference in the “moderating effect” of monetary policy. (3) In terms of control variables, consumption level, fixed capital formation level, and fiscal policy all had a significant positive impact on economic growth, with a positive “spatial spillover effect”. Whereas, the impacts of COVID-19 and export level on economic growth were both negative. Hence, coping with the challenges of COVID-19 and revitalizing exports were important breakthroughs for emerging market countries to recover the domestic economy. Finally, based on the empirical conclusions, this paper proposed three suggestions. First, monetary policy should be strengthened to intervene in the development of digital finance. Second, digital financial development should be integrated into the quantitative framework of monetary policy. Third, it is essential to build a “double pillar” policy framework to compensate for the shortage of monetary policy.

AB  - The study critically investigates the effect of balance of payments deficit and monetary policy on the economic growth of Nigeria between 1980 and 2013 using dynamic econometric model. The variables used in formulating the econometric model were selected from the study of Kallon (1994) within the general framework of Thirlwall and Hussain (1982). The model balance of payments as a percentage share of gross domestic product ( BOP Y ), first lag of balance of payments as a percentage share of gross domestic product (( ) t#x2212;1 ), exchange rate of naira via-a-vis U.S dollar (ER), log of broad money supply (lnMS), and monetary policy rate (INT), in Nigeria during the review period. While, economic growth is proxied by real gross domestic product growth as the regress and. The result indicated that there is long-run relationship between balance of payments, monetary policy and economic growth in Nigeria. Also, balance of payments and monetary policy variables were found to be growth enhancing during the reviewed period. However, emanating from the empirical findings, proper policy recommendations were proffered.

TI  - THE DYNAMIC EFFECT OF MONETARY POLICY ON ETHIOPIAN ECONOMY
AU  - Tadesse, Girma
AB  - Various studies found out contending findings of regarding the effect of monetary policy on
economic growth of across a country. In many developing countries study result showed that
monetary policy has positive, some indicate negative and other found to be uncertainty.
Therefore, the purpose of this study is to examine the extent of impact of monetary policy
variables on economic growth in Ethiopia.To examine the effect of monetary policy in Ethiopia,
secondary time series data were collected from national bank of Ethiopia and mofec starting
1970 EC to2011EC. To analyze the data both descriptive statistics and econometrics model
such as using Autoregressive Distributive lag (ARDL)model were applied.The main findings of
the model attested that in the long run money supply, and unemployment rate have positively
affected real GDP growth rate, while domestic credit, interest rate and inflation have negatively
affected the growth. Besides, the ECM model result of short run shows that money supply has
statistically significant negative effect on the real gross domestic product growth. The
unemployment rate, domestic credit, interest rate and inflation have positive effect on growth in
the short run.Even though Ethiopia has registered almost double digit growth rate for more than
a decade, unemployment rate has been increasing. As a result, the net increment of unemployment
and Economic growth rates have positive relationship both in the short and the long-runs, which
is against existing theory. This is because in Ethiopia there are many unskilled and unemployed
youth who migrate from rural to urban could not be absorbed in the industries. Hence, though
there is fast economic growth in Ethiopia for the last one decade, unemployment rate is increased
along with real GDP growth.

AB  - This study investigates whether and how financial technologies (FinTech) influence the effectiveness of monetary policy transmission. We use an interacted panel vector autoregression model to explore how the effects of monetary policy shocks change with regional-level FinTech adoption. Results indicate that FinTech adoption generally mitigates monetary policy transmission to real GDP, consumer prices, bank loans, and housing prices, with the weakened transmission to bank loan growth being the most pronounced. The regulatory arbitrage and competition between FinTech and banks are the possible mechanisms underlying the mitigated transmission.

An optimal efficient rule equation suggests that a one percentage point increase in bond rate explains a 22% budget deficit variations. A one index point change in nominal exchange rate correlates to a 78% variation in budget deficits. When real exchange rate is adopted in the system, the corresponding percentages become 14 and 86, respectively, showing the fading influence of T-bond rate and the increasing strength of exchange rate.

AB  - This paper examines the international experiences with four basic types of monetary policy regimes: (1) exchange-rate targeting, (2) monetary targeting, (3) inflation targeting, and (4) monetary policy with an implicit but not an explicit nominal anchor. The basic theme that emerges from this analysis is that transparency and accountability are crucial to constraining discretionary monetary policy so that it produces desirable long-run outcomes. Because the devil is in the details in achieving transparency and accountability, what strategy will work best in a country depends on its political, cultural and economic institutions, as well as on its past history.

AB  - Top economists consider how to conduct policy in a world where previous beliefs have been shattered by the recent financial and economic crises.Since 2008, economic policymakers and researchers have occupied a brave new economic world. Previous consensuses have been upended, former assumptions have been cast into doubt, and new approaches have yet to stand the test of time. Policymakers have been forced to improvise and researchers to rethink basic theory. George Akerlof, Nobel Laureate and one of this volume's editors, compares the crisis to a cat stuck in a tree, afraid to move. In April 2013, the International Monetary Fund brought together leading economists and economic policymakers to discuss the slowly emerging contours of the macroeconomic future. This book offers their combined insights.The editors and contributors—who include the Nobel Laureate and bestselling author Joseph Stiglitz, Federal Reserve Vice Chair Janet Yellen, and the former Governor of the Bank of Israel Stanley Fischer—consider the lessons learned from the crisis and its aftermath. They discuss, among other things, post-crisis questions about the traditional policy focus on inflation; macroprudential tools (which focus on the stability of the entire financial system rather than of individual firms) and their effectiveness; fiscal stimulus, public debt, and fiscal consolidation; and exchange rate arrangements.

AU  - Rotich, Henry

AU  - Maana, Isaya
AB  - The paper reviews the recent conduct of monetary policy and the Central Bank rule-based behaviour in Kenya. Using both backward and forward-looking policy rules with appropriate modification to take into account the characteristics in developing countries, we test whether the Central Bank of Kenya (CBK) reacts to changes in inflation, GDP growth and the exchange rate in a consistent and predictable fashion. Our results indicate that during the period after liberalization (1997-2006), CBK has used monetary aggregates as a main policy instrument in conducting monetary policy. The estimate of the coefficient on the inflation gap implies that a rise in expected annual inflation of one percent induces the CBK to lower the expansion of broad money (M3) by 4.2 percent. Similarly, the coefficient of inflation with respect to repo rate is 2.4 which is consistent with Taylor's non-accommodative policy. The results indicate that CBK followed a rule to target inflation with some allowance for output stabilization. We also find a statistically significant reaction to exchange rate, perhaps explaining the relative stability of exchange rate during the greater part of the sample period.

AB  - This paper examines the bank lending channel of monetary policy transmission and the effect of banking sector and capital market development on the lending channel using the bank-level panel data of 89 commercial banks in five ASEAN countries (Thailand, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore and Indonesia) over the period 1999–2011. The results show that monetary policy has a significant effect via the bank lending channel. The higher the capitalization and liquidity of banks, the weaker the effect of monetary policy via the bank lending channel; however, the greater the size of banks, the stronger the bank lending channel. Banking sector development in terms of banking activities and capital market development leads to a weaker effect of monetary policy through the lending channel, while the development of banks in terms of size strengthens the bank lending channel.

T2  - Journal of African Business
AB  - Monetary policy ensures the financial system stabilization. Financial inclusion, characterized by the access and use of available financial services (credit, savings, payments, insurance at a low cost), by a broader population, may explain the effectiveness of the monetary policy, especially in developing countries. The objective of this study is to carry out a comparative analysis between the countries of Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) and the countries of Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC), on the causal relationship between financial inclusion and monetary policy, as well as to assess the impact of financial inclusion over monetary policy. To support our study, we applied the panel vector autoregressive (PVAR) methodology, simple panel data models, and a feasible generalized least squares (FGLS) model. Results provide strong evidence of the existence of reverse causality between financial inclusion and monetary policy in both SSA and LAC, with monetary policy facilitating financial inclusion in both regions. Financial inclusion increases the effectiveness of monetary policy in SSA, while for LAC financial inclusion improves the efficiency of monetary policy. Thus, increased access to and use of financial services increase the efficiency of monetary policy in controlling inflation. Governments are encouraged to design or enhance policies that expand financial services, as well as to promote investment in financial inclusion in developing countries, to maintain the monetary system stability.

In this paper, we bring new evidence using Uganda's supervisory credit register, with microdata on loan applications, volumes and rates, coupled with unanticipated variation in monetary policy. We show that a monetary contraction reduces bank credit supply—increasing loan application rejections and tightening loan volume and rates—especially for banks with more leverage and sovereign debt exposure. There are associated spillovers on inflation and economic activity—including construction permits and trade—and even social unrest.

T2  - Journal of International Money and Finance
AB  - We study the macroeconomic effects of the 3-year long-term refinancing operations (LTROs) introduced by the ECB in December 2011 with the aim of reducing the obstacles to credit supply through the mitigation of liquidity and funding risks in the euro area banking system. Therefore, we interpret the measure as a credit supply shock, which is identified both recursively and with sign restriction methods using the euro area Bank Lending Survey (BLS). The size of the shock due to the LTROs is computed using both the April 2012 BLS and the special ad-hoc questions on the LTROs conducted in February 2012. The counterfactual exercises suggest that the 3-year LTROs lifted prospects for real GDP and loan provision to non-financial corporations and increased goods prices over the next two-to-three years, thereby avoiding a major credit crunch.

AU  - Soares, Rita
T2  - Applied Economics
AB  - In order to overcome the omitted information problem of small-scale Vector Autoregression (VAR) models, this study combines the VAR methodology with dynamic factor analysis and assesses the effects of monetary policy shocks in the euro area in the period during which there is a single monetary policy. Using the Factor-Augmented Vector Autoregressive (FAVAR) approach of Bernanke et al. (2005), we summarize the information contained in a large set of macroeconomic time series with a small number of estimated factors and use them as regressors in recursive VARs to evaluate the impact of the nonsystematic component of the European Central Bank's (ECB's) actions. Overall, our results suggest that the inclusion of factors in the VAR allows us to obtain a more coherent picture of the effects of monetary policy innovations, both by achieving responses easier to understand from the theoretical point of view and by increasing the precision of such responses. Moreover, this framework allows us to compute impulse-response functions for all the variables included in the panel, thereby providing a more complete depiction of the effects of policy disturbances. However, the extra information generated by the FAVAR also delivers some puzzling responses, in particular those relating to exchange rates.

AU  - Afzal, Munshi Naser Ibne
AB  - Keynesian and the monetarist theorist s have been debating for a l ong time on the effectiveness of fisca l
and monetary policy. The outcomes of several empiri cal researches are open to f urther studies and those
outcomes suggest that none of t he policies can be th ought of as superior t o the other. The relative
effectiveness of fiscal and monetary policies in any economy depends on the prevailing economic and
political conditions at any point in time. In order to determine the influence of fiscal and monetary policy
on the economic activity in Bangla desh we have us ed time series analysis on the annual data for the
period 1980-2012. The results obtai ned show that monetary and fiscal bot h the policies are equally
effective in simulating economic growth in Bangl adesh. Moreover it has long run relationship with cointegrated impact on economic growth.

AU  - Peña, Guillermo
T2  - Journal of Central Banking Theory and Practice
AB  - AbstractThe interferences among some financial, economic and monetary variables are checked as an indicator of economic performance in the long run and for the monetary policy applied between the Great Moderation (GM) of 1987-2001 and the Global Financial Crisis of 2007-2009. For achieving this target, some Granger causality tests are applied to GDP growth, credit growth, and lending interest of 36 countries of the EU and the OECD for the full sample of 1987-2012 and the sub-sample of 2002-2007. Results corroborate the interferences among these variables for the discretionary monetary policy applied immediately after the GM, within the “Ad Hoc Era” or “lax period”, and independence when monetary policy was correctly applied and rules-based.

TI  - The international transmission of euro area monetary policy shocks
AU  - Jannsen, Nils
AU  - Klein, Melanie
AB  - This paper analyzes the international transmission effects of euro area monetary policy shocks in to other western European countries, namely the United Kingdom, Sweden, Switzerland, Denmark, and Norway. For this purpose, we use a structural VAR model of the euro area and augment it consecutively by the foreign variables of interest. We find that a monetary policy shock in the euro area leads to a largely similar change in the interest rate and in GDP in these other western European countries. The effects on their exchange rates are limited and their trade balances usually are unaffected. Our results suggest that the income absorption effect to be more important than the expenditure switching effect in the international transmission of monetary policy and that exchange rate stabilization seems to be of some concern to monetary policy makers in small open economies.

T2  - International Journal of Emerging Markets
AB  - Purpose The purpose of this paper is to investigate the risk-taking channel of monetary policy transmission in the Chinese banking industry. This study also investigates the role of various other factors in the risk-taking channel. Design/methodology/approach This study used panel data from 2000 to 2012, and a dynamic panel model (Difference GMM) was applied. Findings The empirical findings of this paper suggest that loose monetary policy rates increase bank risk-taking. Unlike previous studies, the results of this paper suggest that the bank-specific factors (size, liquidity and capitalization) do not significantly affect the risk-taking channel. However, the market structure does have a stabilizing effect on monetary policy transmission and the risk-taking channel. Higher market power weakens the risk-taking channel of monetary policy transmission. Practical implications Of significance to the policymakers' point of view is that loose monetary policy induces banks to take excessive risks. However, such effects can be mitigated by encouraging a proper level of market power in banking markets. Originality/value This study investigated the risk-taking channel of monetary policy transmission for the Chinese banking industry. Due to the unique features of the People's Bank of China (PBC, Central Bank of China) policy, this study also contributes to the literature by comparing price-based and quantity-based monetary policy tools and their effectiveness in financial stability and monetary policy transmission. Furthermore, the role of market structure is also investigated in the risk-taking channel.

AB  - I discuss how the unconventional monetary policy measures implemented over the past several years - quantitative and credit easing, and forward guidance - can be analysed in the context of conventional models of asset prices, with particular reference to exchange rates. I then discuss alternative approaches to interpreting the effects of such policies, and review the empirical evidence. Finally, I examine the ramifications for thinking about the impact on exchange rates and asset prices of emerging market economies. I conclude that although the implementation of unconventional monetary policy measures may introduce more volatility into global markets, in general it will support global rebalancing by encouraging the revaluation of emerging market currencies.

AU  - Ghossoub, Edgar A.

T2  - Journal of Development Economics
AB  - How should financial systems be designed to limit income inequality? Does the redistributive impact of inflation depend on the extent of financial development? Should optimal monetary policy vary across countries with different levels of financial development? In order to address these questions, we develop a monetary growth production model with heterogeneous agents. In our economy, optimal policy needs to weigh the effects of policy across two groups – capital owners and individuals who hold liquid assets. In this environment, we compare various economies that are identical in every aspect except for their level of financial development. Interestingly, we generally find that economies at the highest stages of financial development (economies in which money, bonds, and claims to capital are traded) experience the highest amount of capital formation and social welfare as long as inflation is low. Yet, regardless of the extent of financial development, there are generally redistributive consequences from inflation. Moreover, the model tends to predict that economies with relatively small stock markets produce the highest levels of income inequality. Empirical work examining the role of money growth and the implications of financial development across countries is consistent with predictions from the model.

AB  - Our study of the corporate loan pricing policies of U.S. banks over the past two decades shows that loan spreads for riskier firms become relatively lower during periods of monetary policy easing compared to tightening. This effect is driven by banks with greater risk appetite, measured from individual banks’ answers to the Senior Loan Officers Opinion Survey. Our results hold with different fixed effects that account for time-varying observed and unobserved heterogeneity of credit demand and bank lending conditions that are not directly related to monetary policy. Together with our survey-based measure of bank risk appetite, we provide compelling evidence of the presence of a bank risk-taking channel of monetary policy in the U.S.

AU  - Kolesnik Sofya

T2  - Russian Journal of Money and Finance
AB  - This paper focuses on the effects of the ECB’s unconventional monetary policy on the member countries of the euro area. The analysis is based on a Global VAR model, which allows to take into account mutual influences of processes in the countries of the monetary union. Identification of unconventional monetary policy shock is conducted using a shadow interest rate which reflects changes in economic agents’ expectations following the announcement of unconventional monetary policy measures. The model is estimated using data for the euro area from 2007 to 2018 and covers all of the key instances of implementation of unconventional measures by the ECB. The results show that expansionary policy leads to a significant rise in output and prices in the euro area. Additionally, the effects of unconventional monetary policy are heterogeneous across countries: the response to unconventional monetary policy shock is insignificant in countries that are strongly affected by the crisis, and the effectiveness of the measures varies across countries with different levels of banking sector capitalisation. It was also found that the efficiency of unconventional monetary policy measures against deflation depends upon spillovers of the interaction between core and periphery countries in the monetary union.

Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD) method is used to extract the influencing factors of M2 and analyze their effects. We construct a VAR model to calculate the effects of monetary policy in the context of financial crisis since September 2008, and compare with that in the Asian financial crisis. The results show that the expansionary monetary policies eliminate the negative effects of prior period monetary policies and influences of the financial crisis. These policies avoid a further decline in China's economy in time. The dramatically enhanced positive effects of monetary policy in the short-run may negatively impact economy by possible inflation expectations. The proposed subsequent monetary policy should be fine-tuned for inflation.

T2  - European Economic Review
AB  - In recent years, the industrial organization of the banking system has received a large amount of attention. In particular, it is generally viewed that the size distribution of the banking sector has changed where it is dominated by a small number of large institutions. In this paper, we develop a model of imperfectly competitive banks that differ in terms of the size of their deposit base. Such differences are important for aggregate credit market activity and the effects of monetary policy. Notably, we explain how the optimal size distribution of the banking system involves trade-offs from distortions in credit markets due to imperfect competition across banking markets. Second, the effects of monetary policy on credit market activity are weaker in an economy dominated by a small number of large banks. Empirical analysis examining the role of concentration among the current members of the European Monetary Union is consistent with the predictions of the model.

AB  - In this paper, we assess the influence of monetary policy on the bank-lending channel in both pre- and post-2007 financial crisis periods. In constructing the monetary policy instrument, we used both conventional and unconventional measures, the latter being the asset purchases ratio in the central banks’ balance sheets. In the pre-crisis sub-period, the bank- lending channel operated effectively in response to changes in central banks’ rates. In the post-crisis sub-period, however, this traditional mechanism was distorted. The effect of unconventional measures on the banks’ behavior, however, was statistically significant. Our results suggest that an increase in asset purchases by central banks reduced the financial institutions’ balance sheet dependence to extend financing. Consequently, we infer that the implementation of unconventional monetary policy measures was effective in stimulating credit growth in the post-crisis sub-period.

T2  - Journal of Money, Credit and Banking
AB  - A central issue of monetary policy analysis is the specification of monetary policy shocks. In a structural vector autoregressive setting there has been some controversy about which restrictions to use for identifying the shocks because standard theories do not provide enough information to fully identify monetary policy shocks. In fact, to compare different theories it would even be desirable to have over-identifying restrictions that would make statistical tests of different theories possible. It is pointed out that some progress toward over-identifying monetary policy shocks can be made by using specific data properties. In particular, it is shown that changes in the volatility of the shocks can be used for identification. Based on monthly U.S. data from 1965 to 1996 different theories are tested and it is found that associating monetary policy shocks with shocks to nonborrowed reserves leads to a particularly strong rejection of the model whereas assuming that the Fed accommodates demand shocks to total reserves cannot be rejected.

Using a standard structural vector autoregression (SVAR) model we find strong and persistent effects on Estonian GDP, private consumption, corporate investment, and imports. A monetary policy shock also has strong and sluggish effects on the housing loan and consumer credit interest rates. The estimated reaction of Estonian GDP and the GDP deflator-based inflation rate is about four times stronger than the reaction of euro area-wide aggregates. The strength of the impact depends on the inclusion of the data from the years of the recent financial and economic crisis.

AB  - This study investigated the impact of fiscal and monetary policy on Nigerian economic growth from 1981 to 2015, with the interest in exploring which of fiscal or monetary policy has been effective in propelling economic growth in Nigeria and how GDP growth responds to the monetary and fiscal policy shock. The positive impact of these policy tools on economic performance will help the country achieve sustained growth and while reducing economic instability. Time series data were collected from the central bank of Nigeria (CBN), the international monetary fund (IMF) and the World Bank. Firstly, a vector autoregressive model (VAR) was applied, and then the vector error correction (VEC) model. The VAR model revealed that fiscal policy distorted real GDP but died out after one year, while monetary policy had no significant impact on real GDP. Of the total government expenditure, the impact of capital expenditure was found to have a significant impact on real GDP while the impact of recurrent expenditure was insignificant. With the introduction of VEC model, the study found an unexpected shock on money supply, real effective exchange rate and taxes to have a negative permanent effect on real GDP, while an unexpected shock on recurrent expenditure and capital expenditure to have a positive effect on real GDP. Finally, the study recommends fiscal policy leadership and harmonization between the fiscal and monetary authority, with emphasis on channelling resources to where they are most needed.

First, an increase in the federal funds rate predicts a negative market reaction to M&A announcements, an increase in the likelihood of deal withdrawal, and significant financing challenges for the acquirer in the post-acquisition phase. Second, M&As announced during periods of high monetary policy uncertainty are associated with significant declines in acquirer value. This negative market reaction reflects a unique discount to compensate for the high riskiness of M&As in an uncertain monetary environment. Finally, we show that monetary contraction, rather than monetary policy uncertainty, is a key contributor to the decline in the aggregare M&A activity.

AB  - The effects of shocks on oil prices will always attract the interest of researchers and policy makers as long as such countries are oil revenue dependent. This is the case in the Central African Economic and Monetary Community (CEMAC) where 70% of the regional countries are net oil income earners. In this study, an in-depth investigation was carried out on the short and long run dynamics between monetary policy, oil price volatility and economic growth in the oil producing CEMAC countries. The target countries are Cameroon, Chad, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Equatorial Guinea, Gabon and the Republic of Congo, and the data for the study covered 1980-2018, a period of 38 years. The study employed the panel autoregressive distributed lag model for the short- and long-run dynamics, while a structural vector autoregressive (SVAR) model was employed for shocks and spillover effects. The results identified oil price volatility, GDP growth rate and exchange rate as highly influential variables in the long run, while exchange rate and GDP growth rate only have significant short run influences on monetary policy rates in the region. The countries of the region need to intensify efforts towards the diversification of individual economic base, reduce the importation of foreign goods and formulate monetary policies that will strengthen their currencies and boost the growth potential in the communities.

AB  - The purpose of this paper is to examine empirically the role of monetary policy on economic activity measured by GDP in Sudan over the period (1990"2004). Annual time series data has been used in the analysis to estimate the linear form of the model for the period. Real GDP (Y) is chosen as dependent variable, money supply (M) represent monetary policy. Data for the study were obtained from different sources namely Central Bank of Sudan (CBOS) and Central Bureau of Statistics in the Republic of Sudan (CBS). Using these data OLS method is applied to the model. The empirical results provide that monetary policy has so little impact on economic activity during the period under consideration

TI  - Monetary Policy and the Jamaican Economy: A Sectoral Analysis
AU  - Serju, Prudence
AB  - This paper analyses the response of the real sector to monetary policy shocks. The results from a structural VAR model indicate that monetary policy innovations trigger a cumulative decline in the value added of the economy. With the exception of mining, all the goods producing sectors are affected negatively by monetary tightening. The manufacturing sector experiences the largest and quickest decline in response to an interest rate shock, while financial sector appears vulnerable to such increases in the short term. There is little evidence that the credit channel plays any significant role in the transmission of monetary policy to the real sector in Jamaica.

AB  - This paper confirms that a regime-switching model out-performs a linear VAR model in terms of understanding the system dynamics of asset returns. Impulse responses of REIT returns to either the federal funds rate or the interest rate spread are much larger initially but less persistent. Furthermore, the term structure acts as an amplifier of the impulse response for REIT return, a stabilizer for the housing counterpart under some regime, and, perhaps surprisingly, almost no role for the stock return. In contrast, GDP growth has very marginal effect in the impulse response for all assets.

T2  - African Journal of Economic and Management Studies
AB  - Purpose Empirically, the purpose of this paper is to investigate policy variables that determine monetary policy and economic growth of some selected countries within the economic bloc of Southern Africa Development Community (SADC). The selected countries are Botswana, Democratic Republic of Congo, Lesotho, Madagascar, Malawi, Mozambique, Namibia, South Africa, Swaziland, Zambia and Zimbabwe. Design/methodology/approach Annual time series data for a panel of 11 Southern African countries spanning 1980–2015 were employed in the study. The major instrument of estimation is the dynamic regression panel model. In order to conform to econometric principles, robustness checks were carried out on the variables of interest so as to avoid spurious results. An estimation of impulse response and variance decomposition analyses were to complement the approach to the study. Findings The result of the long-run dynamic panel regression reveals that GDP growth rate, inflation rate, exchange rate, money supply and oil and commodity prices do have profound impact on monetary policy within SADC. It was further revealed from the study that commodity price shock is the major exogenous determinant of monetary policy dynamics and the effect is transmitted via exchange rate channel to macroeconomics of the region; with inflation rate and money supply playing a major role in the transmission mechanism as it affects the economies of the countries in this region. Practical implications The policy implication is that inflation is seen as a major challenge to the countries under review. Among other things, a hybrid of inflation and monetary targeting should be adopted to complement each other as policy combination within the region. Originality/value The study accounts for the determinants of monetary policy vis-à-vis growth potentials of some selected countries in SADC, using a combination of dynamic regression panel approach and SVAR elements.

AU  - Liao, Changjun

T2  - The Developing Economies
AB  - Previous studies have argued that heterogeneities across regions in economic and/or financial variables drive the differential regional effects of monetary policy. In this study, we conduct a political economy analysis of the regional effects of China's monetary policy (i.e., economic competition between local governments) as Chinese-style fiscal decentralization and China's promotion tournament for officials produce regional effects. Furthermore, we use a threshold model and provincial-level data from 2005 to 2018 to test our hypotheses and estimate exogenous monetary policy shocks. We find that (1) economic competition between regions is a key driver of the asymmetric regional effects of monetary policy and (2) the fiercer the competition a province faces, the less effective the monetary policy is in shaping economic growth there. Our conclusion remains unchanged when we change the threshold variable and divide the sample into three subregions.

We estimate the marginal propensity to sterilize foreign asset accumulation associated with net balance of payments inflows, across countries, and over time. We find that the extent of sterilization of foreign reserve inflows has risen in recent years to varying degrees in Asia as well as in Latin America, consistent with greater concerns about the potential inflationary impact of reserve inflows. We also find that sterilization depends on the composition of balance of payments inflows.

AB  - This paper applies the identified VAR methodology to synthetic euro area data from 1980 till 1998 to study the macro-economic effects of an unexpected change in monetary policy in the euro area. The focus is on the area-wide monetary transmission. It is shown that the overall macro-economic effects of a monetary policy shock in the euro area are very similar to those estimated for the United States and are surprisingly stable over time. In addition, the paper contains a number of robustness checks with alternative identification schemes and examines how various real and financial variables (such as the GDP or money components) respond to an area-wide monetary policy impulse.

AU  - Omolade, Adeleke

T2  - Investment Management and Financial Innovations
AB  - The principal objective of this study is to investigate the relationship between monetary policy and growth of the manufacturing sector in Algeria. Using a structural vector autoregressive model and quarterly frequency data for the period 1980Q1 to 2010Q4, the study finds no evidence that money supply responds to fluctuations in manufacturing sector growth or Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth. Interest rates, however, are seen to explain nearly a third of the variations in manufacturing output growth, suggesting that the manufacturing sector is sensitive to interest rates. The study also reveals that money supply variations are largely explained by changes in interest rates. A peek at the monetary transmission process reveals that Algeria employs monetary aggregates as the primary operating tool of monetary policy. The monetary authorities adjust total money supply in response to any movements in the rate of interest, probably to keep the rate of interest within a certain target given other developments in the fundamentals. The interest rates, in turn, play an important role in determining variations in manufacturing sector growth. In addition, the interest rates significantly affect exchange rates, which are observed to respond to changes in overall GDP growth. It is the overall GDP growth that has the largest influence on manufacturing sector growth, probably due to strong forward and backward linkages between the manufacturing sector and other sectors of the economy.

AB  - Monetary policy plays a significant role in the economic growth of a developing country like Bangladesh by influencing the cost and availability of credit, inflation control and balance of payment. The current improving GDP growth of Bangladesh is the contribution of different components of monetary policy. This paper aims at identifying the impact of monetary policy on the overall economic development of Bangladesh. The purpose of the study is to develop a cause and effect relationship between the monetary policy and different economic factors that lead to economic growth of Bangladesh. To conduct this research data of last 20 years from 1997-2017 were collected. Primary data from 57 respondents from different commercial banks were collected to conduct this study. Different economic variables that affects a country’s GDP such as- inflation rate, employment rate, lending rate, borrowing rate, export-import growth rate, broad money growth rate, FDI rate in percent of GDP were used for this study. Both descriptive and inferential statistics were used in analyzing the data. Multivariate analysis technique like Exploratory factor analysis using SPSS version 20.0 was performed to identify the factors that influence the overall economic performance of Bangladesh. Multiple regressions were run to identify the relationship between monetary policy and the economic development of Bangladesh. The results show that factors like consumption, investment, government net expenditure and net export significantly affects the GDP growth of Bangladesh. The study also identifies that the monetary policy of Bangladesh has significant impact on these mediating factors. The research brings an important insight regarding the socio-economic development of Bangladesh by ensuring proper implication of the monetary policy. If the central bank and policy makers focus on the above significant factors Bangladesh will see more robust economic growth in the near future.

AB  - The study examined the empirical link on the effect of fiscal and monetary policy on the Economic Growth of Nigeria (1986-2010). The objectives were to determine factors of fiscal and monetary policy that contributed to the growth of Nigeria economy. It made use of secondary data, from Central Bank of Nigeria statistical Bulletin, Volume 21, 2010 and employed the ordinary least squares method of statistical analysis. It was found out that government revenue had a positive impact and statistical significant on gross domestic product. Also shown that government expenditure was positively significant on the growth of Nigeria Economy. The second model depicts that money supply had a positive impact on gross domestic product and it discovered that this variable was statistically significant. Exchange rate variable had a positive impact on the performance of Nigeria economy. The finding revealed that inflation had a positive impact but there was no significant relationship between inflation and gross domestic product. It therefore suggests that government should increase the number of fiscal policy instruments over and above the ones currently in use. The study recommended that measures should be adopted that would ensure income generation and government revenue generating ventures.

AB  - One of the most important criteria in measuring the effect of economic policy is how monetary and fiscal policy interact and the effect of this interaction on economic growth. An important point in studying the interaction between monetary and fiscal policies is the coordination between these policies in order to achieve the goals of economic growth. Accordingly, considering the interaction of monetary and fiscal policies in different periods of the Iranian economy using the TVP-VAR method, which can evaluate the effects of economic policy changes on macro variables over time, this article studies the shock effect of monetary and fiscal policies and their impact on the two macroeconomic variables, namely inflation and GDP in the period 1379 to 1398. The results show that the effect of fiscal policy on GDP growth is larger than monetary policy. The analysis of the interaction of monetary and fiscal policies shows two important results. First, the increase in government debt has a greater effect on output growth and increased liquidity than the monetary policy shock due to its more stable and broader effect. Second, monetary policy can lead to more sustained inflation. The most important policy recommendation of this study is that considering the dominant role of fiscal policy in the Iranian economy in the period under review, it is necessary for monetary policymakers to pay sufficient attention to the central bank using a regular monetary policy framework to control inflation and the main goal that is controlling inflation and maintaining stable economic growth.

AB  - By employing a non-linear autoregressive distributed lag (NARDL) model, this study investigates the effect of monetary policy uncertainty on insurance premium in Japan. Asides the confirmation of a long-run relationship between monetary policy uncertainty, insurance premium and real income, we also find that a positive relationship exists between monetary policy uncertainty and insurance premium. This shows that when economic policy uncertainty increases (decreases) then insurance premiums increases (decreases) in response. Moreover, we discovered that monetary policy uncertainty impacts insurance premium in an asymmetric way, such that negative changes have a bigger effect than positive changes on total insurance premium in Japan. We also found that real income has a significant and positive effect on insurance premium, and that the long run elasticity of insurance premium on real income is smaller than unit. This implies that insurance is a necessity and not a luxury in Japan.

AB  - What is the effect of monetary policy on bank profitability? This paper uses a new long-run dataset spanning 17 countries and 145 years to address this question. I show that a monetary policy tightening leads to an increase in the spread between lending and deposit rates. But even though spreads go up, bank profitability falls. The disconnect between spreads and profits is driven by a sharp increase in loan losses and a contraction in credit growth. I also show that the profitability effect of monetary policy is highly state dependent. The higher their reliance on mortgage credit and non-deposit funding, the more sensitive banks’ profits are to changes in policy rates. This holds both in the long-run cross-country data and across individual banks in the United States.

T2  - International Review of Applied Economics
AB  - We test the hypothesis that public banks reduce monetary policy power. Previous studies have shown that companies with access to government-driven credit present smaller fall in investment and production after a contractionary monetary policy shock. Nevertheless, these studies are based on microeconomic data and ignore macroeconomic effects, especially the cost-push effects, of monetary policy. We employ state-dependent local projections to compare monetary policy power – the sensibility of inflation to changes in policy interest rate – between periods of high credit of public banks and periods of high credit of private banks. We do not find evidence that monetary policy is less powerful in periods of high credit of public banks. Even though periods of high credit of public banks present a lower effect over output, those periods present less persistent price puzzles than periods of high private credit. Robustness of results is enhanced by performing several tests. We attribute our results to lower flexibility in interest rates of credit from public banks, what leads to lower transmission in financial costs, lower reduction in capital stock and lower variation in the exchange rate.

AB  - This paper analyzes forward-looking rules for Swiss monetary policy in a small structural VAR consisting of four variables. First, the paper looks at the ex ante inflation-output-growth volatility trade-off for a forward-looking policy aiming at a convex combination of a strict inflation and output growth targeting rule implied by this SVAR model. Thereby the paper introduces a new analytical method. Second, the paper considers the effect of measurement errors in GDP on this inflation-output-growth volatility trade-off. Third, the paper works at the impact of changing beliefs about the potential growth rate on the variability of output growth and inflation. Finally the effects of different targets in a forward-looking monetary policy on ex post or unconditional volatility of inflation and output growth is explored by a simulation exercise.

T2  - The Review of Financial Studies
AB  - Through explicitly incorporating analysts' forecasts as observable factors in a dynamic arbitrage-free model of the yield curve, this research proposes a framework for studying the impact of shifts in market sentiment on interest rates of all maturities. An empirical examination reveals that survey expectations about inflation, output growth, and the anticipated path of monetary policy actions contain important information for explaining movements in bond yields. Estimates from a forward-looking monetary policy rule suggest that the central bank exhibits a preemptive response to inflationary expectations while accommodating output growth and monetary policy expectations. Forecasted GDP growth plays a significant role in explaining time variation in the market prices of risk. The sensitivity of long yields is linked to the persistence of expected inflation under the risk-neutral measure. Models of this type may provide traders and policymakers with a new set of tools for formally assessing the reaction of bond yields to shifts in market expectations.

AB  - The article assesses the response of Tehran stock prices to exogenous monetary policy shocks, using a vector error correction model for the 1998Q1–2013Q2 period. Monetary policy is transmitted to stock market price through three routes: money by itself, exchange rate and inflation. Our result in this paper points to the fact that stock prices increase persistently in response to an exogenous easing monetary policy. Variance deposition results show that, after ten periods, the forecast error variance of more than 53 per cent of the Tehran Stock Exchange Price Index (TEPIX) can be explained by the exogenous shocks to the US dollar–Iranian rial exchange rate, while this ratio for exogenous shocks to the Iranian real gross domestic product was only 17 per cent. The article argues that such evidence can be accounted for by an endogenous response of the stock prices to the monetary policy shocks.

TI  - Assessing the Transmission of Monetary Policy Shocks Using Dynamic Factor Models
AU  - Korobilis, Dimitris
AB  - This paper extends the current literature which questions the stability of the monetary transmission mechanism, by proposing a factor-augmented vector autoregressive (VAR) model with time-varying coefficients and stochastic volatility. The VAR coefficients and error covariances may change gradually in every period or be subject to abrupt breaks. The model is applied to 143 post-World War II quarterly variables fully describing the US economy. I show that both endogenous and exogenous shocks to the US economy resulted in the high inflation volatility during the 1970s and early 1980s. The time-varying factor augmented VAR produces impulse responses of inflation which significantly reduce the price puzzle. Impulse responses of other indicators of the economy show that the most notable changes in the transmission of unanticipated monetary policy shocks occurred for GDP, investment, exchange rates and money.

AU  - Ahiadorme, Johnson Worlanyo
T2  - Studies in Economics and Finance
AB  - Purpose This paper aims to examine the distributional channel of monetary policy (MP) and evaluate how financial development (FD) affects the transmission mechanism from MP to income inequality. Design/methodology/approach The empirical investigation is implemented for 32 sub-Saharan African countries over the period 2000–2017, with the aid of vector autoregressions and a dynamic panel data model. Findings This study shows that MP has a significant impact on income inequality and the financial system plays an important role by dampening the dis-equalising effects of MP shocks. Both MP and FD directly exert redistributive effects. However, the financial system appears to wield the greatest impact and contribute more to the inequality dynamics. Practical implications The policy-relevant conclusion is that the financial system is crucial for the monetary transmission mechanism and the effects of MP actions. As the economy develops financially, it may require less movement in the policy position to achieve the desired policy outcome. Also, macroeconomic stabilisation policies may not be distributionally neutral and may have a role to play in averting longer-term increases in inequality. Originality/value Contrary to previous studies, this study indicates MP by the structural shocks to purge the MP stance of the issues of endogenous and anticipatory actions. A distinctive finding of this paper is that cross-country differences in monetary regimes and income explain a significant variation in the distributional impacts of monetary policy. Notwithstanding, the evidence shows that the strength of the transmission is more dependent on FD than the nature of the policy regime.

We develop and estimate the endogenously switching monetary policy rule that is based on institutional facts and at the same time tractable in the spirit of Taylor (1993). This development, along with two newly constructed micro banking datasets, enables us to establish the following empirical evidence. Contractionary monetary policy during 2009–2015 caused shadow banking loans to rise rapidly, offsetting the expected decline of traditional bank loans and hampering the effectiveness of monetary policy on total bank credit. We advance a theoretical explanation of our empirical findings.

AB  - This paper explores for spillovers from monetary policy in the United States to a number of advanced countries, namely Canada, Denmark, the Eurozone, Japan, Sweden, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom. We use monthly data, from January 1997 to December 2017, and a bivariate structural GARCH-in-Mean VAR to investigate the effects of positive and negative U.S. monetary policy shocks, and also whether monetary policy uncertainty in the United States has had statistically significant spillover effects on each of the other advanced countries. Our evidence suggests that positive (negative) U.S. monetary policy shocks increase (reduce) the policy rate in each of the other countries, and that monetary policy uncertainty in the United States has a negative and statistically significant effect on the monetary policy rate of each of the other countries.

AB  - This paper provides an overview of the monetary transmission mechanism describing the impact of changes in monetary policy on real GDP. Changes in financial market prices--including long-term interest rates and exchange rates--are the main vehicle for the transmission of policy. The framework incorporates rational expectations and policy rules. It is empirical and appears to fit the facts well.

TI  - A Non-Standard Monetary Policy Shock: The ECB’s 3-year LTROs and the Shift in Credit Supply
AU  - Darracq Paries, Matthieu
AU  - De Santis, Roberto A.
AB  - The identification of non-standard monetary policy shocks is a key challenge for econometricians, not least as these measures are somewhat unprecedented in modern central banking history and as the instruments vary widely across the various non-standard measures. This paper focuses on the 3-year long-term re-financing operations (LTROs), implemented by the ECB in December 2011 and February 2012. The macroeconomic impact of this measure is identified using the April 2012 Bank Lending Survey (BLS) as well as the special ad-hoc questions on the LTROs conducted in mid-February 2012. We estimate a panel-VAR for the euro area countries, which include relevant BLS variables, and identify credit supply shocks both recursively and with sign restriction methods. The macroeconomic effects of the 3-year LTROs are associated with the favorable credit supply shocks extracted through BLS information for the first half of 2012. Compared with the most likely developments one could have expected at the end of 2011 when financial tensions culminated, our counterfactual exercises suggest that the 3-year LTROs significantly lifted prospects for real GDP and loan provision to non-financial corporations over the next two-to-three years.

T2  - Journal of Financial Stability
AB  - This paper sheds some light on situations in which monetary and macroprudential policies may interact (and potentially get into conflict) and contributes to the discussion about the coordination of those policies. Using data for the Czech Republic and five euro area countries we show that monetary tightening has a negative impact on the credit-to-GDP ratio and the non-risk-weighted bank capital ratio (i.e. a positive impact on bank leverage), while these effects have strengthened considerably since mid-2011. This supports the view that accommodative monetary policy contributes to a build-up of financial vulnerabilities, i.e. it boosts the credit cycle. On the other hand, the effect of the higher bank capital ratio is associated with some degree of uncertainty. For these and other reasons, coordination of the two policies is necessary to avoid an undesirable policy mix preventing effective achievement of the main objectives in the two policy areas.

AB  - In this paper we investigate the effect of standard and non-standard monetary policy implemented by the ECB on income inequality in Italy. We use a novel database based on the survey micro level data on Income and Living Conditions (EU-SILC, Istat) in a repeated cross-section experiment which enables us to compute measures of inequality and the distribution over time for different incomes and subgroups of individuals. The identification strategy is based on the monetary surprises estimated in the euro area Monetary Policy Event-Study Database (EA-MPD) for the euro area. Using a battery of Local Projections, we evaluate the impact of monetary policy by comparing the performance of the impulse response functions of our inequality measures in different policy scenarios: 1999-2012 (pre-QE) and 1999-2017 (including the QE period). The main findings show that an expansionary unconventional monetary policy shock compressed inequality of disposable, labor and financial income more persistently than a conventional monetary shock. These effects are heterogeneous and seem to benefit mostly the bottom of the distribution. The impact on financial wealth is ambiguous favoring the wealthy households mainly in the short-run. Our evidence suggests that QE is associated with a decrease in Italian households’ inequality.

AB  - We assess transmission mechanisms and the macroeconomic impact of unconventional monetary policy (UMP) in the Euro Area. We estimate a FAVAR model and use a shadow rate to measure the stance of the monetary policy. The ECB's UMP measures adopted at the zero lower bound (ZLB) have sustained the real economy. For instance, in 2016, without UMP, investment would have been lower by 9%, consumption lower by 2% and the unemployment rate higher by 0.9%. However, the impact of unconventional monetary shocks is weaker and less persistent than those emanating from conventional monetary policy. Furthermore, the difference in the transmission of monetary policies between countries of the Euro Area was more pronounced during the period 2009-2016. This suggests that the ZLB has decreased the efficiency of monetary policy and accentuated the heterogeneity of the Euro Area.

AB  - Spillovers from US monetary policy entail spillbacks to the domestic economy. Applying counterfactual analyses in a Bayesian proxy structural vector-autoregressive model we find that spillbacks account for a non-trivial share of the slowdown in domestic real activity following a contractionary US monetary policy shock. Spillbacks materialise as a monetary policy tightening depresses foreign sales and valuations of US firms so that Tobin’s q/cash flow and stock market wealth effects impinge on investment and consumption. Net trade does not contribute to spillbacks because US monetary policy affects exports and imports similarly. Geographically, spillbacks materialise through advanced rather than emerging market economies.

AB  - Profit is one of the most important factors influencing economic decision-making, the changes of which depend on various factors. Banks, as one of the most important business units, have a special reliance on the concept of profitability, and their performance is significantly influenced by macroeconomic conditions. Government economic policies are placed. Accordingly, the purpose of this article is to investigate the impact of monetary policy on the profitability of banks. For this purpose, the application of panel regression model has been used to study the effect of monetary policy on bank profitability during the period 2006-2018. The required data has been extracted and used through the website of the Central Bank and the Statistics Center of Iran. In this research, panel regression models in the form of GMM methods and panel grinder causality have been used to analyze data and critique hypotheses. Research findings show that expansionary monetary policy has a positive effect on the performance of banks. In a way, reducing the ratio of legal reserves improves the performance of banks. Bank lending and price inflation have a negative impact on banks' performance; Overdue claims and GDP also have a positive effect on banks' performance.

AB  - Outstanding Government Sharia Securities (SBSN) in Indonesia from the first published on 2008 continued to experience significant growth. Monetary indicators often associated with capital markets are inflation, exchange rate and interest rate (BI Rate) show a fluctuating pattern, these factors can inhibitSBSN growth.This study aims to analyze the effect of monetary policy(inflation, exchange rate and BI Rate) on Government Sharia Securities (SBSN) and the contribution of Government Sharia Securities (SBSN) tothe state budget(APBN). Using monthly time series data from January 2010 until July 2016 and Autoregressive Distributed Lag (ARDL), the estimation results conclude that there is a co-integration in the models studied. While the estimation result of ARDL shows in the long term, exchange rate significantly has an effect on SBSN. While inflation and BI Rate have no significant effect on SBSN either in the short or long term. This study also shows the positive contribution of SBSN as deficit financing and development project. Therefore, the government must optimize the state sukuk by increasing the issuance of state sukuk in the structure of the state budget and supported by the control of inflation and exchange rate. For investors can take advantage of the state sukuk to invest, this is consistent with the insignificant effect of interest rate so that the investment is safe with sharia principles.

We relax the assumption that policy regimes are fixed, and estimate interest rate rules for monetary policy and tax rules for fiscal policy that switch stochastically between two regimes. We also use of a structural vector autoregressive (VAR) model to analyze the effects of fiscal policies, similar to the ones undertaken by the Canadian government (and other governments around the world) during the coronavirus pandemic. We find that fiscal policy has been more active than monetary policy and that deficit spending helps to boost economic activity in the short-run. However, the positive effects on real GDP and real private consumption die out with the end of the fiscal stimulus. Long-term interest rates rise, investment falls, and inflation rises, creating problems for an inflation targeting central bank.

AB  - PURPOSE : We evaluate the comparative effectsof US monetary and fiscal policy uncertainty shockson real equity prices and real gross domestic productin developed and emerging economies.
DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH : We employ the Global Vector Autoregressive (GVAR) model to trace the propagation effects of both U.S. monetary and fiscal policy uncertainty shocks on real equity prices and real gross domestic product. We utilize the GVAR database coveringboth the advanced and emerging countries (including the US) throughout 1985Q1 to 2019Q4 whose scope is governed by the availability of dataset for the equity market volatility-based monetary and fiscal policy uncertainty indices.
FINDINGS : We find that both the US fiscal and monetary policy uncertainty shocks have greater negative effects on the advanced markets thantheir emerging market counterparts. However, regardless of the market classification, we show that real equity prices respond more to monetary policy uncertainty than real gross domestic product while the reverse holds for fiscal policy uncertainty shock.
ORIGINALITY/VALUE : The current literature on parsedUSpolicy uncertainty shock with specific focus on real equity prices and real gross domestic product dwells on either monetary policy or fiscal policy uncertainty with a limited focus on country specificor few group of countries in a panel framework. We contribute to theliteratureby evaluating thecomparative effectsof both US monetary and fiscal policy uncertainty shocksthat account for theinternational transmission effect of the uncertainty shock within a GVAR framework.
PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS : International investors need to understand the extent to which their returns can be undermined by US policy actions and potential diversification strategies based on the heterogeneous response of individual markets to the US uncertainty shocks.

TI  - EBSCOhost | 35215698 | MONETARY POLICY, CAPITAL REQUIREMENT AND LENDING BEHAVIOUR OF ISLAMIC BANKING IN MALAYSIA.
AB  - This paper tries to analyze the role of Islamic banks in the transmission of monetary policy and business cycle. This study will only analyse the Islamic banking in Malaysia. Previous studies such as, Keynes (1936) found that money plays an important role to economic growth. Furthermore, Gurley and Shaw (1995) began to redirect attention toward the overall interaction between financial structure and real activity, emphasizing financial intermediation, and particularly the role of financial intermediaries in the credit supply process as opposed to the money supply process. However, Bernanke and Blinder (1988) performed another view that looked into the assets side as a monetary policy channel to influence the economic activities. The changes in the monetary policy channel give an idea to regulate and strengthen the banking industry. Thus, several questions can be highlighted: how do the changes in the monetary policy tools affect the bank lending? If bank lending plays as monetary policy channel, do they affect the other portfolio? Do the current regulations (such as capital requirement) affect the Islamic bank lending? Furthermore, this analysis will be used the Generalize Least Squares approach to estimate the monetary changes toward Islamic banks portfolio. Annual data will be used from the year 1997 until 2004. The number of observations is based on the combination of time series and cross-sectional data, which is known as pooled data. Instead of that, we will use an unbalanced bank-level panel data set for Islamic banks (i.e., two full-pledged Islamic banks and thirteen Islamic windows).

AB  - This study empirically examines the effect of monetary, fiscal and trade policy on economic growth in Pakistan using annual time series data from 1981 to 2009. Money supply, government expenditure and trade openness are used as proxies of monetary, fiscal and trade policy respectively. Cointegration and error correction model indicate the existence of positive significant long run and short run relationship of monetary and fiscal policy with economic growth. Result also indicates that monetary policy is more effective than fiscal policy in Pakistan. In contrast, trade policy has insignificant effect on economic growth both in the short run and in the long run. In light of the findings, it is suggested that the policy makers should focus more on monetary policy in order to ensure economic growth in the country. It is also recommended that further research should be conducted to find out such components of exports and imports which lead to the ineffectiveness of trade policy to enhance economic growth in Pakistan.

AB  - Monetary policy is closely related to activities to achieve economic growth, which eventually gives welfare to the community. This study aims to analyze the description of the transmission flow of financing channels, the effect of monetary policy instruments, and their effectiveness to achieve economic growth. The variables used are Islamic Banking Finance (FIN), return of Sharia Bank Indonesia Certificate (SBIS), return of PUAS, and Industrial Production Index (IPI). This study used Vector Error Correction Model (VECM) to determine short- and long-term relationships using the time series data. First, the result of the study showed that the transmission flow could not be identified clearly, because the flow stopped in FIN, and it could not affect IPI, according to the Granger Causality test. Second, the result of VECM estimation showed that all variables only affected long term period and did not affect the short-term period. Third, monetary policy transmission of Islamic banking financing channel was not effective enough, which was proven with the result of IRF simulation, which showed that the effect of shock on financing channel variable (FIN) towards IPI was subsided and stable in the 10th period later. Meanwhile, the result of the FEVD simulation showed that the financing channel variable (FIN) only gave a contribution of as much as 0.14 percent towards IPI. The contribution and policy implications are also discussed in this study.

AB  - This article investigates the bank-specific characteristics of risk-taking behavior of the Turkish banking sector as well as the existence of risk-taking channel of monetary policy in Turkey. Using bank-level quarterly data over the period 2002–2012 a dynamic panel model is estimated. We find evidence that low short-term interest rates reduce the risk of outstanding loans; however short-term interest rates below a theoretical benchmark increase risk-taking of banks. This result holds for macroeconomic controls and external factors as well. Furthermore, in terms of bank-specific characteristics, our analysis suggests that large, liquid, and well-capitalized banks are less prone to risk-taking.

AB  - This article examines the relationship between Federal Reserve monetary policy and other macroeconomic indicators to both a broad commodity price index and an agricultural commodity price index by employing a vector error correction model. Excessive liquidity and the recent long period of ultralow interest rates appear to have played a statistically significant role in affecting prices in the commodities markets. The responses of commodity prices to monetary policy that we estimate generally conform to earlier findings, but the sensitivity of the responses appears different in the face of the unprecedented scope of recent Fed activism.
