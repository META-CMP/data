TI  - The Ambiguous Signaling Channel of Monetary Policy
AU  - Zhang, Donghai
AB  - Excess sensitivity—the significant effects of monetary policy on long-term interest rates—is a well-known puzzle. This paper documents excess sensitivity as being more pronounced in response to monetary policy easing than monetary tightening—the asymmetric excess-sensitivity puzzle. A micro-founded model that rationalizes the findings is proposed. Policy actions signal the economy’s unobserved state because of the central bank’s private information. Knightian uncertainty about the precision of the policy signal and ambiguity-averse preferences give rise to the ambiguous signaling channel of monetary policy. The model predicts that monetary easing has stronger and excessive effects on long-term interest rates but weaker impacts on real GDP than does monetary tightening. I provide evidence that supports the proposed mechanism.

AB  - Global financial integration has substantially increased in recent decades. Initially, it manifested itself in growing capital flows between developed countries. In response to the removal of capital controls, financial innovation and technological progress, financial integration has subsequently spread to emerging market countries. Gross and net capital flows between developed and emerging economies have increased. Financial integration has also been evident in frequently high correlations between asset yields or prices, particularly for certain asset classes such as high-yield corporate bonds and sovereign bonds and equities in developed and emerging markets.

TI  - The relative effectiveness of Monetary and Fiscal Policies on growth: what does long-run SVAR model tell us?
AU  - Şen, Hüseyin
AU  - Kaya, Ayşe
AB  - This paper studies empirically the relative effectiveness of monetary and fiscal policies on growth. Unlike many previous papers which have focused, to a large extent, on the effect of monetary or fiscal policies separately, this paper considers the comparative efficacy of the two policies on growth by applying the Structural Vector Autoregression (SVAR) model to the quarterly data for Turkey over the period 2001:Q1-2014:Q2. The empirical findings of this paper show that both monetary and fiscal policies do have significant effects on growth. However, monetary policy is more effective than fiscal policy in stimulating growth. More specifically, interest rate ―a monetary policy variable― is the most potent instrument in affecting growth. Then budget deficit ―a fiscal policy variable― becomes the second important variable after interest rate. These findings suggest that although the relative effectiveness in boosting growth is different, both policies significantly affect growth, suggesting that they should be used jointly but in an efficient manner.

AB  - We analyze monetary policy in a New Keynesian model with durable and nondurable goods each with a separate degree of price rigidity. The model behavior is governed by two New Keynesian Phillips Curves. If durable goods are sufficiently long-lived we obtain an intriguing variant of the well-known “divine coincidence.” In our model, the output gap depends only on inflation in the durable goods sector. We then analyze the optimal Taylor rule for this economy. If the monetary authority wants to stabilize the aggregate output gap, it places much more emphasis on stabilizing durable goods inflation (relative to its share of value-added in the economy). In contrast, if the monetary authority values stabilizing aggregate inflation, then it is optimal to respond to sectoral inflation in direct proportion to their shares of economic activity. Our results flow from the inherently high interest elasticity of demand for durable goods. We use numerical methods to verify the robustness of our analytical results for a broader class of model parameterizations.

AB  - This paper estimates a bivariate econometric model to describe Russia’s real GDP while taking account of the Russian economy’s high dependence on oil prices, monetary policy regime change, and economic growth slowdown. We follow the theory of long-run neutrality of monetary policy and assume that the Bank of Russia’s monetary policy regime change in late 2014 has influenced only the short-run relationship between Russia’s GDP and oil prices, but long-run multiplier is invariant to monetary policy. The paper also attempts to take account of the economic growth slowdown in last decade. The model has demonstrated good forecasting performance.

T2  - International Research Journal of Finance and Economics
AB  - This study examines the impact of monetary policy on selected macroeconomic variables such as gross domestic product, unemployment, inflation and balance of payments using the Augmented Dickey Fuller test, Co-integration test and the Error Correction Model on annual data collected for the period of 1970-2012. The study reveals that there is a long run relationship between monetary policy variables (money supply, exchange rate and real interest rate) and the selected macroeconomic variables (gross domestic product, inflation, unemployment and balance of payments). It was observed that monetary exerts moderate impact on the selected macroeconomic variables in Nigeria. The paper validates previous works done on the efficacy of monetary policy and also submits that appropriate sanitation exercise be carried out by the CBN to make the banking environment conducive. Such activity by the CBN will improve monetary policy in Nigeria and eventually lead to an overall improvement of the selected macroeconomic variables. Based on the foregoing, the paper recommends that the monetary authorities should streamline its measures especially the prevailing interest rate through the use of indirect International Research Journal of Finance and Economics-Issue 126 (2014) 8 tools in order to achieve the targeted inflation rate that is desirable, the monetary authorities should take necessary steps to reduce the spread between bank lending rate and savings deposit rate to not more than 10% by encouraging banks to do so, the monetary and fiscal policy authorities should coordinate their activities and introduce policies that will encourage banks to allocate foreign exchange in favour of the manufacturing sector and not in the favour of importers of consumer goods.

TI  - Monetary Policy Transmission and Targeting Mechanisms in the MENA Region
AU  - Neaime, Simon
AB  - Since the early 1990s some industrialized economies have implemented a monetary policy
regime shift known as inflation targeting. This shift was justified by the difficulties posed by
targeting the nominal exchange rate, or in some instances money supply. Given the very
encouraging experience of developed countries, a number of MENA countries decided to
adopt price stability as an explicit monetary policy objective. Using sophisticated time series
econometric techniques, this study aims to highlight the monetary transmission mechanism
across the region, and to assess how successful the MENA countries have been in making a
smooth transition to inflation targeting. The empirical results indicate that the recent success
of Turkey and Egypt in adopting flexible exchange rates has helped those countries shift to an
inflation targeting regime. It is also shown that Jordan, Lebanon, Morocco and Tunisia will
have to introduce more flexibility into their exchange rates before they can shift to an
inflation targeting monetary policy regime. Other empirical results indicate that for Egypt and
Turkey, the exchange rate played a dominant role in the transmission mechanism of monetary
policy, while for Jordan, Lebanon, Morocco, and Tunisia it was the interest rate that played
the dominant role.

AB  - This paper models a fiscal policy that pursues primary balance targets to stabilize the debt-to-GDP ratio in an open and heterogeneous economy where firms combine public and private capital to produce their goods. The model extends the European NAWM presented in Coenen  et al. (2008) and Christoffel et al. (2008) by broadening the scope for fiscal policy implementation and allowing for heterogeneity in labor skills. The domestic economy is also assumed to follow a forward looking Taylor-rule consistent with an inflation targeting regime. We correct the NAWM specification of the final-goods price indices, the recursive representation of the wage setting rule, and the wage distortion index. We calibrate the model for Brazil to analyze some implications of monetary and fiscal policy interaction and explore some of the implications of fiscal policy in this class of DSGE models.

References to the FOMC’s current framework for monetary policy refer to the framework articulated in the Statement on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy first issued in January 2012 and reaffirmed each January, most recently in January 2019.We review the macroeconomic performance over the period since the Global Financial Crisis and the challenges in the pursuit of the Federal Reserve’s dual mandate. We characterize the use of forward guidance and balance sheet policies after the federal funds rate reached the effective lower bound. We also review the evidence on the efficacy of these tools and consider whether policymakers might have used them more forcefully. Finally, we examine the post-crisis experience of other major central banks with these policy tools.

This study investigates the relative effectiveness of both types of policies in the context of modern panel data analysis in case of South Asian Countries during the period from 1990 to 2007 to test the Monetarist and Keynesian claims, and to find out that whether the policy instruments have a significant relationship with economic growth. Im, Pesaran, and Shin and Levin, Lin, and Chu tests have been used to investigate the order of integration. For long run and short run relationship we utilised the advance Autoregressive Distributed Lag Model ARDL a co-integration (panel) test and ECM (Error Correction Method) respectively.

AB  - This paper examines the pattern of excess liquidity in sub-Saharan Africa and its consequences for the effectiveness of monetary policy. The paper argues that understanding the consequences of excess liquidity requires quantifying the extent to which commercial bank holdings of excess liquidity exceed levels required for precautionary purposes. It proposes a methodology for measuring this quantity and uses it to estimate a nonlinear structural VAR model for the CEMAC region, Nigeria and Uganda. The study suggests that excess liquidity weakens the monetary policy transmission mechanism and thus the ability of monetary authorities to influence demand conditions in the economy.

AB  - We investigate spillovers from US monetary policy to bank lending in Asia. When Asian banks use funding denominated in US dollars and other currencies, a tightening of US monetary policy will contract bank loan supply via funding volumes/costs. Panel regressions demonstrate such effects on bank lending volumes and prices in Asia, holding constant local economic conditions. Supplementary results are consistent with transmission channels via funding conditions. Our results extend work on the impact of US monetary policy on international inter-bank funding flows and are consistent with several implications from findings in that literature.

AB  - The practice of central banking seems always to be changing, and the role of money growth targets as guidelines for monetary policy is as good an example as any. With remarkable rapidity — at least in retrospect — quantity targets based on specified monetary aggregates assumed center stage in the conduct of monetary policy, only then to move to the periphery or even fade from the scene altogether. This same evolution, and with about the same timing, has occurred in one central bank after another around the world.

TI  - The Effect of Monetary Policy on House Prices – How Strong is the Transmission?
AU  - Ehrenbergerová, Dominika
AU  - Bajzík, Josef
AB  - In the current long-lasting period of low interest rates and overheating housing markets, the discussion of the effect of monetary policy on house prices has arisen again. We examine the broad empirical literature on this topic. We collect 1,447 estimates of the effect of changes in short-term interest rates on house prices. These estimates come from 31 studies and are drawn from vector autoregression models. On average, an increase in the interest rate by one percentage point causes a median decrease in house prices of 0.7 percent for the one-year horizon and 0.9 percent for the two-year horizon. Moreover, we show that at the medium-term (monetary policy) horizon, the effect of monetary policy remains signiﬁcant after correcting for the publication bias present in the literature. In addition, we collect more than 40 control variables. These capture, ﬁrst, the context in which the estimates were obtained, and, second, the characteristics of the economies in question. Within both groups of variables we identify several signiﬁcant aspects explaining differences in the estimates reported in the literature. The most prominent drivers of the heterogeneity are the use of sign restrictions, the inclusion of additional endogenous variables in VAR models, and the level of indebtedness.

T2  - IMF Economic Review
AB  - The recent financial crisis and ensuing recession appear to have put the productive capacity of the economy on a lower and shallower trajectory than the one that seemed to be in place prior to 2007. Using a version of an unobserved components model introduced by Fleischman and Roberts, we estimate that potential GDP in late 2014 was about 7 percent below the trajectory it appeared to be on prior to 2007. We argue that a significant portion of the recent damage to the supply side of the economy plausibly was endogenous to the weakness in aggregate demand. Endogeneity of supply with respect to demand provides a strong motivation for a vigorous policy response to a weakening in aggregate demand, and we present optimal-control simulations showing how monetary policy might respond to such endogeneity in the absence of other considerations. We then discuss how other considerations—such as increased risks of financial instability or inflation instability—could cause policymakers to exercise restraint in their response to cyclical weakness.

The shocks are identified by combining simultaneous diagonalization of the reduced form error covariance matrices with constraints on the time-varying impact matrix. This leads to flexible identification conditions, and some of the constraints are also testable. The empirical application studies asymmetries in the effects of the U.S. monetary policy shock and finds strong asymmetries with respect to the sign and size of the shock and to the initial state of the economy.

AB  - This article estimates monetary policy rules for two key emerging market economies: Brazil and China. It analyses whether the monetary authority reacts to changes in economic activity, financial markets, monetary conditions, the foreign exchange market and the commodity price. We assess the importance of nonlinearity using a smooth transition regression (STR) model. Using quarterly data over the time period 1990:1 to 2008:4, we find that considerations about the output gap and the real effective exchange rate (in the case of Brazil), and the inflation rate (for China) explain the nonlinear adjustment of the central bank rate. Moreover, the results suggest that central banks pursue a target range for the threshold variable rather than a specific point target. In the case of China, the McCallum rule shows that the GDP growth, the interest rate and the commodity price drive the response of the growth rate of the relevant monetary aggregate.

A2  - De Bonis, Riccardo
A2  - Pozzolo, Alberto Franco
AB  - This paper provides new evidence on the transmission of monetary policy in the euro area, assessing the effects of a monetary tightening on the lending and borrowing activities of households, firms and other economic sectors. I exploit, for the first time, the information content of the flow-of-funds statistics, representing the most complete framework for analysing the flows of funds moving from one sector (the lender) to the other (the borrower). I estimate a parsimonious recursive VAR in order to identify monetary policy shocks in the euro area. Its predictions as to the responses of the main economic aggregates are in line both with existing literature and with theoretical priors on the effects a monetary policy shock should produce, without suffering from the empirical puzzles that can be found in some previous works. The benchmark model is then extended to include the flow-of-funds variables. I find evidence of a certain degree of inertia in firms’ behaviour. In fact, following a policy tightening firms increase net funds raised at impact. Households adjust their financial investment and borrowing attitude quite rapidly after the shock, reducing the overall accumulation of financial assets and switching from deposits and mutual fund shares to short-term securities. Special attention is devoted to the impact of a policy tightening on loans to the private sector. As in previous studies on the euro-area economy, we find that an interest-rate hike is followed by an increase in loans granted to households and firms in the short run. This result, which anyway is not as counter-intuitive as it may look, vanishes when only bank loans are taken into account in the analysis.

AB  - In this article, we study the relationship between monetary policy and corporate bankruptcies in the USA. The main hypothesis is that an increase in the monetary base or a decrease in the federal funds rate reduces the probability of corporate bankruptcies. The main intuition lies in the economic mechanism through which both of these actions accelerate inflation and lower the real value of corporate debt. The results strongly support the main hypothesis of the paper. In addition, we also study the impact of other macroeconomic variables on bankruptcy rates. Our findings show that the total reserves of depositary institutions and the overall performance of the US corporate sector are negatively related to the frequency of corporate failures.

AU  - Wieladek, Tomasz
AB  - A range of hypotheses have been put forward to explain the boom in house prices that occurred in the United States from the mid-1990s to 2007.  This paper considers the relative importance of two of these hypotheses.  First, global imbalances increased liquidity in the US financial system, driving down long-term real interest rates.  Second, the Federal Reserve kept interest rates low in the first half of the 2000s.  Both factors reduced the cost of borrowing and may have encouraged the boom in house prices.  This paper develops an empirical framework to separate the relative contributions of these two factors to the US housing market.  The results suggest that capital inflows to the United States played a bigger role in generating the increase in house prices than monetary policy loosening.  Using VAR methods, we find that compared to monetary policy, the effect of a capital inflows shock on US house prices and residential investment is about twice as large and substantially more persistent.  Results from variance decompositions suggest that, at a forecast horizon of 20 quarters, capital flows shocks explain 15% of the variation in real house prices, while monetary policy shocks explain only 5%.  In a simple counterfactual exercise, we find that if the ratio of the current account deficit to GDP had remained constant since the end of 1998, real house prices by the end of 2007 would have been 13% lower.  Similar exercises with constant policy rates and the path of policy rates implied by the Taylor rule deliver smaller effects.

TI  - A Natural Experiment in Monetary Policy Covering Three Episodes of Growth and Decline in the Economy and the Stock Market
AU  - Friedman, Milton
T2  - Journal of Economic Perspectives
AB  - The third of three episodes in a major natural experiment in monetary policy that started more than 80 years ago is just now coming to an end. The experiment consists in observing the effect on the economy and the stock market of the monetary policies followed during and after three very similar periods of rapid economic growth in response to rapid technological change: the booms of the 1920s in the United States, the 1980s in Japan and the 1990s in the United States. In this experiment, the quantity of money is the counterpart of the experimenter's input. The performance of the economy and the level of the stock market are the counterpart of the experimenter's output. The results of this natural experiment are clear, at least for major ups and downs: what happens to the quantity of money has a determinative effect on what happens to national income and to stock prices. The results strongly support Anna Schwartz's and my 1963 conjecture about the role of monetary policy in the Great Contraction. They also support the view that monetary policy deserves much credit for the mildness of the recession that followed the collapse of the U.S. boom in late 2000.

AB  - This study examines the impact of monetary policy on economic growth in Uganda during the period from 1983 to 2014. Using the newly developed ARDL bounds testing approach, the empirical results of this study show that money supply has a positive significant impact on economic growth, both in the short run and in the long run. However, interest rates were found to have a positive impact on economic growth only in the short run. In the long run they were found to have no significant impact on economic growth. Overall, monetary policy matters for economic growth but there is a need for further reforms aimed at the development of the financial sector as well as improvement in monetary and fiscal policy coordination.

AB  - Two impediments to effective monetary policy operation include illiquidity in bond markets and the zero bound of interest rates. Under these conditions alternative means of enacting monetary policy may be required. This paper empirically explores policy options implemented through equity and currency markets that will generate similar inflation responses at different time horizons. In terms of GDP loss the least costly means of achieving a particular long run inflation outcome is via the current monetary policy arrangements. Currency market alternatives are volatile but less expensive than the equity market in terms of output loss for short term inflation horizons.

T2  - Journal of Economic Cooperation and Development
AB  - Monetary policy influences the real economy through various channels including the bank lending. Currently, Malaysia is operating under dual banking systems; conventional and Islamic banking. The latter has distinctive feature of interest-free. Hence, this study aims to empirically explore the relevance of Islamic banks' financing in channeling the monetary policy effects to the real economy. To achieve this objective, the study relies on an autoregressive distributed lag (ARDL) bound testing approach and innovation accounting approach, and uses quarterly data spanning from 1991:Q1 to 2010:Q4. The study documents that Islamic financing channel for monetary transmission exists in Malaysia. Islamic financing is unequally distributed to economic sectors in response to monetary policy shock. Furthermore, the findings also reflect that Islamic banking as operating in dual banking system is not spared from the interest rate and monetary conditions of the country. This clearly shows the behavior of Islamic banking which cannot shun away from the interest rate while its operation delinks from the interest rates. In designing monetary policy, the central bank should consider Islamic financing as an alternative or complement channel for monetary transmission since this channel is just as active as conventional lending channel.

The optimal control path for the monetary instrument, the interest rate, is the result of a dynamic minimization problem in a continuous-time fashion. The model allows considering various economic dynamics ranging from hyperinflation to disinflation, sustained growth and recession.

TI  - ALTERNATIVE OF MONETARY POLICY INDICATOR: PANEL DATA ANALYSIS FROM ISLAMIC BANKS IN MALAYSIA

T2  - Journal of Islamic Monetary Economics and Finance
AB  - The monetary policy indicators such as monetary aggregates, interest rates and Monetary Condition Index (MCI) are the traditional monetary policy indicators used in order to obtain early indication of the impact of monetary policy. These indicators could function as appropriate monetary policy indicators that will provide information to the monetary policy makers. The development in Islamic financial system however creates a challenge to find a monetary policy indicator, which is in conformity with Islamic teaching. Therefore, this paper is aimed to examine the future growth of nominal GDP as an alternative variable for monetary policy indicator in Islamic monetary system. The investigation will benefit from data of 17 Islamic banks in Malaysia which implement full fledge or Islamic windows scheme spanning from 2005 to 2010. GMM system method is used to analyze the data in hope to validate the appropriateness of the alternative monetary policy indicator. The result suggests that the future growth of nominal GDP is significant as monetary policy indicator and could be applied by the central bank in implementing the monetary policy especially in the dual banking system.

AB  - The primary aim of sustainable development goals (SDGs) 2030 is to provide a better and more sustainable future for all. Therefore, it is obligatory to focus on all points of SDGs to reach sustainable production and consumption by leaving no point behind. Achieving these goals is impossible if reorientation of fiscal and monetary policies is overlooked, which have substantial policy scope. The current study plans to establish the linkages from monetary and fiscal policies of G7 countries to disaggregated level renewable energy generation between 2000 & 2018. The study adopts the standard Stochastic Impact of Regression on Population, Affluence, and Technology (STIRPAT) model and crossectional augmented econometric algorithms to reach unbiased and efficient conclusions. The empirical results imply that fiscal expansion has a significant positive role in renewable energy generation. At the same time, the expansionary monetary policy indicates a negative response to the investment in renewable energy generation of the G7 countries. The results imply a similar response tendency on the disaggregated levels of energy generation. However, the causal test responds that there is unidirectional causality from renewable energy towards the fiscal and monetary policy indicators of G7 economies. The updated policies are drawn for theory and practice.

AB  - We assess the significance of global shocks for the world economy and national central banks and governments. More specifically, we investigate whether monetary policy has become less effective in the wake of financial globalization. We also analyze whether there is increasing uncertainty for central banks due to globalization-driven changes in the national economic structure. A FAVAR framework is applied to identify structural shocks on a world level and their effect on other global and national variables. To estimate our macroeconomic model, we employ quarterly data from Q1 1984 to Q4 2007 for the G7 countries and the euro area. According to our results, global liquidity shocks significantly influence the world economy and also various national economies. But common shocks driven by real estate prices and GDP also turn out to be significant at a global scale. These results prove to be robust across different specifications.

AB  - This paper studies the effects of quantitative easing on income and wealth of individual euro area households. The aggregate effects of quantitative easing are estimated in a multi-country VAR model of the four largest euro area countries, in which key variables affecting household income and wealth are included, such as the unemployment rate, wages, interest rates, house prices and stock prices. The aggregate effects are distributed across the individual households by means of a reduced-form simulation on micro data from the Household Finance and Consumption Survey, capturing the income composition, the portfolio composition and the earnings heterogeneity channels of transmission. We find that the earnings heterogeneity channel plays a key role: quantitative easing compresses the income distribution since many households with lower incomes become employed. In contrast, monetary policy has only negligible effects on wealth inequality.

AU  - Christensen, Ane Kathrine
AB  - In the wake of the Great Recession, a massive monetary policy stimulus was provided in the main OECD economies. It helped to stabilise financial markets and avoid deflation. Nonetheless, GDP growth has been sluggish and in some countries lower than expected given the measures taken, and estimated economic slack remains large. In this context, this paper assesses the effectiveness of monetary policy in recent years. It finds that notwithstanding an almost full transmission of policy interest rate cuts and unconventional policy measures to higher asset prices and lower cost of credit in and outside the banking sector in most countries, with the exception of vulnerable euro area economies, monetary policy stimulus did not show up in stronger growth due to a combination of three factors. First, lower policy interest rates may not have provided as much stimulus as expected given the evidence of a decrease in natural interest rates, resulting from the estimated decline in potential GDP growth in the wake of the crisis. Second, balance sheet adjustments of non-financial companies and households, large uncertainty as well as simultaneous and considerable fiscal consolidation in many OECD countries constituted important headwinds. Third, the bank lending channel of monetary policy transmission appears to have been impaired, mainly due to considerable balance sheet adjustments and prevailing uncertainty, which together limited banks’ capacity and willingness to supply credit. The paper also stresses that the monetary accommodation risks having unintended negative consequences which are likely to increase with its duration.

AB  - Monetary policy is more effective when financial intermediaries have a higher equity share in their total assets. When the leverage ratio is one standard deviation below average, the marginal effect of a monetary policy shock on realized S&P 500 returns is 89% larger in an event window study. In a VAR exercise, the impulse responses of real variables to a given monetary policy shock also have larger magnitudes when financial intermediaries have a lower leverage. The financial intermediary leverage is counter-cyclical, explaining why monetary policy is less effective during recessions as found in the literature.

The presence of these frictions leads to the existence of two steady states with credit rationing. An increase in the money growth rate, the world interest rate or reserve requirements raises (lowers) GDP in the high (low) activity steady state. However, sufficiently large increases in money growth or the world interest rate can transform the high activity steady state from a sink to a source. The model also delivers prescriptions for restoring the stability of this steady state in such an eventuality.Journal of Economic LiteratureClassification Numbers: E5, F4.

TI  - Unconventional Monetary Policy in the Euro Zone
AU  - Driffill, John
T2  - Open Economies Review
AB  - The European Central Bank adopted a policy of quantitative easing early in 2015, long after the US and UK, and after implementing a succession of measures to increase liquidity in the Euro zone financial markets, none of which proved sufficient eventually. The paper draws out lessons for the Euro zone from US and UK experience. Numerous event studies have been undertaken to uncover the effects of QE on yields on and prices of financial assets. Estimated effects on long-term government bond yields are then converted into the size of the cut in the policy rate that would normally have been needed to produce them. From these implicit cuts in policy rates, estimates of the effect on GDP and inflation are generated. Euro zone QE appears to have had a much smaller effect on bond yields for the core members states than did QE in the US or UK. Therefore its effects on output and inflation are likely to be proportionately smaller. Its effects on long-term government bond yields in periphery members are greater. QE is compressing interest differential among Euro zone member states. The dangers of QE to which various commentators draw attention, that it creates a danger of inflation in the future, that it creates asset price bubbles, that it allows zombie firms and banks to survive, slowing down the process of adjustment, seem remote. Meanwhile it makes a useful contribution to cutting the costs of debt service and allowing member states more fiscal room for maneouvre.

T2  - Journal of Money, Credit and Banking
AB  - How do intellectual property rights that determine the market power of firms influence the growth and welfare effects of monetary policy? To analyze this question, we develop a monetary hybrid endogenous growth model in which R&D and capital accumulation are both engines of long-run economic growth. We find that monetary expansion hurts economic growth and social welfare by reducing R&D and capital accumulation. Furthermore, a larger market power of firms strengthens these growth and welfare effects of monetary policy through the R&D channel but weakens these effects through the capital-accumulation channel. Therefore, whether the market power of firms amplifies or mitigates the welfare cost of inflation depends on the relative importance of the two growth engines. Finally, we calibrate the model using data in the United States and the Euro Area to quantitatively evaluate and compare the welfare cost of inflation in these two economies and find that the R&D channel dominates in both economies.

TI  - Assessing the effect of monetary policy on economic growth in franc zone
AU  - Douanla Tayo, Lionel
AB  - This study aims at assessing the effect of monetary policy on economic growth for the fourteen countries of the Franc zone over the period 1985-2012 using a dynamic panel model. The system estimator of the generalized method of moments has allowed us to demonstrate a significant and negative effect of domestic credit provided by banking sector on economic growth. The analysis reveals that money supply has significant positive effect on economic growth, while total reserves and inflation have a negative effect. However the negative effect of domestic credit provided by banking sector can be reversed through allocation of funds to those projects for which the social returns are the highest and through allocation of funds to productive local industries.

AB  - This paper offers a comprehensive comparison of the structure of banking and financial markets in the euro area. Based on this, several hypotheses about the role of banks in monetary policy transmission are developed. Many of the predictions that have been proposed for the U.S. are deemed unlikely to apply in Europe. Testing these hypotheses we find that monetary policy does alter bank loan supply, with the effects most dependent on the liquidity of individual banks. Unlike in the US, the size of a bank does generally not explain its lending reaction. We also show that the standard publicly available database, BankScope, obscures the heterogeneity across banks. Indeed, for several types of questions BankScope data suggest very different answers than more complete data that reside at national central banks.

AB  - This paper tries to analyse the role of Islamic banks in the transmission of monetary policy and business cycle. This study will only analyse the Islamic banking in Malaysia. The changes in the monetary policy channel give an idea to regulate and strengthen the banking industry. Thus, several questions can be highlighted: how do the changes in the monetary policy tools affect the bank lending? If bank lending plays as monetary policy channel, do they affect the other portfolio? Do the current regulations (such as capital requirement) af-fect the Islamic bank lending? Furthermore, Generalize Least Squares approach will be us-ing to estimate the monetary changes towards Islamic banks portfolio. Annual data will be used from the year 1997 until 2004. The number of observations is based on the combination of time series and cross-sectional data, which is known as pooled data. Instead of that, we will use an unbalanced bank-level panel data set for Islamic banks (i.e., two full-pledged Islamic banks and thirteen Islamic windows).JEL Classification numbers: E51, E52, E58Keywords: Transmission Mechanism; Monetary Policy; Lending Channel

T2  - Journal of Economic Integration
AB  - This paper examines whether the effects of monetary policy on the exchange rates depend on the degree of openness of an economy. Theoretically, it can be shown that the effect of openness on the ability of money to influence the exchange rate is ambiguous. In light of this, the purpose of this study is to investigate how the relationship between monetary policy and exchange rate is affected by openness, hence shedding some light on the theoretical ambiguity. Using annual data for a panel of 41 countries for the period 1988-2000, the paper's empirical results indicate that the effects of monetary policy on the exchange rates are negatively affected by economy's openness. It seems that the more open the economy, the smaller is the depreciation effects of a given increase in the money growth rate. More interestingly, contrary to conventional expectations, monetary expansions in developed countries do not seem to result in depreciation of the domestic currency.

T2  - Applied Economics
AB  - Inequality has been largely ignored in the literature and practice of monetary policy, but is gaining more attention recently. Here, we exclusively focus on the impact of unconventional monetary policy (UMP) on inequality. We look at how the recent UMP in Japan affected inequality, using household survey data. Our vector auto regression (VAR) results show that UMP widened income inequality after 2008Q3 as the Bank of Japan (BoJ) resumed its zero-interest rate policy and reinstated UMP. This is largely due to the portfolio channel. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to empirically analyse the distributional impact of UMP. Japan’s extensive experience with UMP may hold important policy implications for other countries.

AU  - Ubaid, Basiem
T2  - International Business Management
AB  - The monetary policy is a vital method used in implementing monetary stability through: the management of income and adjustment of the price (monetary targets) in order to promote stability and growth of real output (non-cash goals); the tool of interest rate and direct investment guides or movement towards the desired destination; and supervisory instruments of monetary policy in both quantitative and qualitative. The latter is very important as a standard compass to investigate the purposes of the movement monetary policy in the economy. The public and businesses were given monetary policy signals by those tools. In fiscal policy, there are specific techniques to follow to do the spending and collection of revenue. This is done in order to actualize the adopted goals by the state and the relative closeness between monetary policy and fiscal policy objectives that requires relationship between two policies. Also, in order to achieve the goal of stability and promote economic growth within the tax multiplier. Multiplier of government spending is aiming at the goal of stability automatically and the allocation or distribution of economic stability through a basic introduction of the aim and objective of allocating resources to the required fields. In this vein, the objectives of the fiscal policy can be brought up spontaneously with the provisions of side and control effects which are in consonant with the outcome received in terms of economic cycle. The research showed that the impact of monetary policy in Iraq is insignificant on non-oil gross domestic product through a multiplier of monetary policy (K) and the flexibility of non-oil gross domestic product for money supply (E). Similarly, the impact of fiscal policy on non-oil gross domestic product through the fiscal policy multiplier (K) and the flexibility of non-oil gross domestic product for the government to spend are insignificant

AU  - Gambacorta, Leonardo
AB  - This paper investigates the link between low interest rates and bank risk-taking. Monetary policy may influence banks’ perceptions of, and attitude towards, risk in at least two ways: (i) through a search for yield process, especially in the case of nominal return targets; and (ii) by means of the impact of interest rates on valuations, incomes and cash flows, which in turn can modify how banks measure risk. Using a comprehensive dataset of listed banks, this paper finds that low interest rates over an extended period cause an increase in banks’ risk-taking.

AB  - The purpose of the Seventh Bank of Japan International Conference is to discuss ways in which monetary policy can be made more effective. There are many routes to a more effective monetary policy — through more accurate measurement of inflation, greater knowledge of the monetary transmission mechanism, better ways to supervise banks and other financial institutions, and so on. But the most basic route of all, in my view, is through the development of a set of monetary policy rules or guidelines to help guide monetary policy decisions.

AB  - Foreign banks’ lending to firms in emerging market economies (EMEs) is large and denominated predominantly in U.S. dollars. This creates a direct connection between U.S. monetary policy and EME credit cycles. We estimate that over a typical U.S. monetary easing cycle, EME borrowers experience a 32-percentage-point greater increase in the volume of loans issued by foreign banks than do borrowers from developed markets, followed by a fast credit contraction of a similar magnitude upon reversal of the cycle. Consistent with a risk-driven credit-supply adjustment, we show that the spillover is stronger for riskier EMEs, and, within countries, for higher-risk firms.

AB  - We study the effects of Chinese monetary policy shocks on China's major trading partners in East and South-East Asia by estimating structural vector autoregressive (SVAR) models for six economies in the region. We find that a monetary expansion in Mainland China leads to an increase in real GDP (temporary) and the price level (permanent) in a number of economies in our sample, most notably in Hong Kong and the Philippines. The impact could result from intertemporal substitution present in a general equilibrium framework, which allows for positive domestic impacts of foreign monetary expansions. Our results emphasize the growing importance of China for its neighbouring economies and the significance of Chinese shocks for the design of monetary policy in Asian economies.

T2  - Journal of Development Economics
AB  - Despite welfare and poverty-reducing benefits for recipient households, remittance inflows have been shown to entail macroeconomic challenges; producing Dutch Disease-type effects, reducing the quality of institutions, delaying fiscal adjustment, and having an indeterminate effect on long-run growth. This paper explores an additional challenge, for monetary policy. Although remittances expand bank balance sheets, providing a stable flow of interest-insensitive funding, they tend to increase banks' holdings of liquid assets. This both reduces the need for an interbank market and severs the link between policy rate and banks’ marginal cost of funds, thus shutting down a major transmission channel. We develop a stylized model based on asymmetric information and a lack of transparent borrowers and undertake econometric analysis providing evidence that increased remittance inflows are associated with weaker transmission. As independent monetary policy becomes impaired, this result is consistent with earlier findings that recipient countries tend to favor fixed exchange rate regimes.

We use a time-varying vector autoregressive model over the quarterly period of 1972:1 to 2018:1. We find protracted periods, starting from the onset of the recent financial crisis to the end of the sample period, where contractionary monetary policy is associated with increases in the bubble component in the REITs of the US economy. This result, which is robust to alternative REITs indexes, is contrary to the “conventional” view, as well as to the predictions of standard models of bubbles.

AU  - Raddatz, Claudio E.
AU  - Rigobon, Roberto
AB  - Raddatz and Rigobon present an identification strategy that allows them to study the sectoral effects of monetary policy and the role that monetary policy plays in the transmission of sectoral shocks. They apply their methodology to the case of the United States and find some significant differences in the sectoral responses to monetary policy. They also find that monetary policy is a significant source of sectoral transfers. In particular, a shock to equipment and software investment, which one identifies with the high-tech crisis, induces a response by the monetary authority that generates a temporary boom in residential investment and durables consumption but has almost no effect on the high-tech sector. Finally, the authors perform an exercise evaluating the model's predictions about the automatic and more aggressive monetary policy response to a shock similar to the one that hit the United States in early 2001. They find that the actual drop in interest rates is in line with the predictions of the model.

AB  - The transmission of monetary policy refers to how changes to the cash rate affect economic activity and inflation. This article outlines the stages of transmission and the channels through which it occurs. The effects of monetary policy are hard to quantify, though the housing market seems particularly important to the transmission process in Australia. A lower cash rate stimulates household spending and housing investment, partly through increasing the wealth and cash flow of households. A lower cash rate also tends to result in a depreciation of the exchange rate, leading to higher net exports and imported inflation.

TI  - The Impact of Unconventional Monetary Policy on the Italian Economy During the Sovereign Debt Crisis
AU  - Casiraghi, Marco

AU  - Secchi, Alessandro
AB  - We assess the impact on the Italian economy of the main unconventional monetary policies adopted by the ECB in 2011-2012 (SMP, 3-year LTROs and OMTs) by following a two-step approach. We evaluate their effects on money market interest rates, government bond yields and credit availability and then map them onto macroeconomic implications using the Bank of Italy quarterly model of the Italian economy. We find that the SMP and the OMTs have been effective in counteracting increases in government bond yields and that the LTROs have had a beneficial impact on credit supply and money market conditions. From a macroeconomic perspective, we find that the unconventional policies have had a large positive effect on the Italian economy, mainly through the credit channel, with a cumulative impact on GDP growth of 2.7 percentage points over the period 2012-2013. To conclude, while the policies did not prevent the Italian economy from falling into recession, they did avoid a more intense credit crunch and a larger output fall than those actually observed.

AB  - Problem statement: It is important for policy makers to find affect of monetary and fiscal policy on economic growth and to know how those impacts on growth to present a effective policies. Approach: We apply the bounds testing (ARDL) approach and to cointegration which is more appropriate for estimation in small sample studies. The data span for the study is from 1960-2006, the empirical results found a cointegration relations between Growth, monetary policy and fiscal policy in Iran. Results: The results indicated the impact of Exchange rate and inflation on growth was negative, government expenditure was found to have significant positive impact on growth. Conclusion: According to results for a sustainable economic growth in Iran, policy makers must try to decrease inflation rate and exchange rate also to find an equilibrium point for government expenditure in futures.

T2  - International Finance
AB  - This paper analyses the effects of monetary policy on inequality over the business cycle via its impacts on returns on assets, the cost of debt servicing, and asset prices in selected advanced economies. Monetary policy easing has a priori ambiguous effects on income and net wealth inequality via financial channels. Effects depend in a complex way on the relative size and distributions of assets, liabilities, and income. In practice, these effects are estimated to be small. A house price increase generally reduces net wealth inequality, while the opposite is true for increases in stock and bond prices. As monetary policy has the potential to affect inequality, monetary authorities face communication challenges. The available research on interactions between monetary policy and inequality does not justify targeting inequality by central banks.

T2  - Modern Economy
AB  - The purpose of this study is to investigate the presence of a bank lending channel of monetary policy in the Sierra Leone. This study uses a dynamic panel data method namely generalized method of moments (GMM) procedure, employing quarterly bank-level data spanning the period 2014-2018, to empirically investigate whether or not changes in the monetary policy in Sierra Leone influence bank lending behaviour, i.e., existence of a bank lending channel. It also examines the extent to which bank-level characteristics-size, liquidity and capital-affect the effectiveness of the monetary policy. Our result revealed that the monetary policy rate significantly and negatively influences banks’ loan supply. Specifically, a 100 basis point increase in the monetary policy rate leads to a 0.43 percent decrease in loan supply to the economy. This lends support for the existence of the bank lending channel of monetary policy transmission in Sierra Leone and that banks do play a role in Sierra Leone’s monetary transmission mechanism. In addition, the interaction term between monetary policy variable and size has the positive sign and is statistically significant. The positive sign of the interaction term with size is consistent with the theoretical explanation of the bank lending channel, which assumes that lending volumes of larger banks are less sensitive to monetary policy conditions than that for smaller banks. Furthermore, commercial banks’ loan supply in Sierra Leone is also explained by past loan supply, economic activity (Real GDP) and inflation. However, we find that liquidity and bank capital do not influence banks’ loan supply. The statistical insignificance of the interaction term with capital and liquidity suggests that bank capital and liquidity are not a source of asymmetric response of banks to monetary policy stance. The main policy implications that can be gleaned from this study are that, in assessing the stance of the monetary policy, beside the Monetary policy rate, it is important for the Central Bank to monitor the micro-dynamics of individual bank characteristics, as it relates to size, in order to enhance the efficacy of monetary policy impact on the real sector in Sierra Leone.

TI  - Globalization and Monetary Policy: Missions Impossible
AU  - Taylor, John B.
T2  - International Dimensions of Monetary Policy
AB  - Globalization is not a new issue in monetary economics. Indeed, for at least
three decades the forces of globalization have been presenting challenges for
both monetary policy and the theory that underlies it. The challenges never
seem easy. When I look back on the history of this period and consider the
challenges faced, I am reminded of the theme from Mission Impossible: in
one episode after another, people pursued a seemingly impossible mission
and in the end the mission was, amazingly, accomplished.
In this chapter, I examine three such missions impossible in the area of
globalization and monetary policy. The fi rst—M:i:I—begins thirty years
ago, the second—M:i:II—begins ten years ago, and the third—M:i:III—
takes place today. For each mission, I discuss: (a) the theory, or the ideas
developed to accomplish the mission; (b) the policy, or the implementation
of these ideas; and (c) the results. Unlike the movies, the connection between
the theory, the policy, and the results is not obvious, but speculating about
the connection is intriguing

AB  - Conventional wisdom holds that lowering a home country's interest rate relative to another's will depreciate the domestic currency. We document that US monetary policy easings actually had the opposite effect during the Great Recession. We attribute this effect to calendar-based forward guidance that signaled economic weakness which resulted in a flight-to-safety effect and lower expected inflation in the United States. Our results imply that accusations that the Federal Reserve engaged in a "competitive devaluation" over the Great Recession were unfounded.

AB  - The paper analyses the transmission of US monetary policy shocks to global equity markets and the macroeconomic determinants of the underlying transmission process. We show that there is a substantial cross-country heterogeneity in reactions across 50 equity markets worldwide, with returns falling on average around 2.7% in response to a 100 basis point tightening of US monetary policy, but ranging from a zero response in some to a reaction of 5% or more in other markets. As to the determinants of the strength of transmission to individual countries, we test the relevance of their macroeconomic policies and the role of real and financial integration. We find that in particular the degree of global integration of countries – and not a country's bilateral integration with the United States – is a key determinant for the transmission process.

AB  - The study evaluated the impact of monetary policy on the growth of emerging economy: Nigerian experience. It was not a gain saying that monetary policy played significant roles in any country’s financial growth and development both in high and low income economies, but are constrained by fiscal dominance, high cost of funds, high inflation etc., but exchange rate, interest rate, money supply and foreign reserve are some of the significant monetary policy indicators that can ascertain national economic growth. The study covers between 1990 and 2012, the scope is considered because it fell within the era of market-based monetary period. Automated Statistical Package Technique (ASPT) was used to analyse the model. The Ordinary Least Square (OLS) technique was adopted in the study in order to assess the relationship among the economic variables. The paper concludes that the major problem of monetary policy was as a result of the CBN’s inability to control the money supply and bank credits, which were very essential for measuring and proffering solution to the substantial credit spreads between short-term central bank policy rates and the rates facing households and firms in the economy. The study recommended that the government should implement countercyclical policy that would lead to the desired expansion of output (and employment); though, it entailed an increase in the money supply, which would also result in an increase in prices, but policymakers should commit to holistic policies, rules and regulations that would remove full discretion in adjusting monetary policy.

TI  - Modelling of Fiscal and Monetary Policy Interactions in the Republic of Belarus
AB  - The article discusses classical and modern macroeconomic models of interaction of fiscal and monetary policies in Belarus. The hypothesis of this research is that the interaction of fiscal and monetary policies has a synergistic effect on economic growth and that at certain stages, one of these policies prevails over the other. This hypothesis was tested with the help of an IS-LM model, which was used to investigate the joint effects of monetary and fiscal policies on business activity in Belarus. A Markov switching model was developed in Eviews software to analyze the interaction between these policies. Regression dependences of the average tax burden (including the burden imposed by social security contributions) and GDP, investment and the refinancing rate were built by using Excel software. To solve the IS-LM model, the value of autonomous consumption was computed with the help of the adjusted value of the average propensity to consume. It was found that autonomous consumption is comparable with the budget of subsistence minimum in Belarus. The share of government spending in the GDP structure was on average 35.01%. The comparison of gross savings and investment showed that in the majority of periods, gross savings insignificantly exceeded the amount of investment, that is, the available funds were used for consumer lending rather than for investment. Analysis of the Markov switching model has led us to the conclusion that from the first quarter 2005 until the fourth quarter of 2009, the fiscal policy in Belarus was in the active regime. The passive fiscal policy regime was observed in the period between the first quarter of 2010 and the first quarter of 2019. In this period, a rise in the public debt was accompanied by an increase in the budget surplus. In the second quarter of 2019, there was a transition to a more active fiscal policy, which points to the need to intensify tax...

AB  - This paper summarises the work done by Eurosystem staff in the context of the Strategy Review Seminar on Monetary Policy Instruments. More specifically, it focuses on the efficacy, efficiency and potential side effects of the key monetary policy instruments employed by the European Central Bank since 2014. The following main findings emerge from the analysis. First, instruments have been effective in easing financing conditions and supporting economic growth, employment and inflation. Second, considering the effective lower bound on policy rates, a combination of instruments is generally more efficient than relying on a single tool. Third, side effects have been generally contained so far, but they are found to vary over time and need to be closely monitored on an ongoing basis. Fourth, the monetary policy toolkit needs to remain innovative, diversified, and flexible, i.e. reviewed regularly to ensure that it remains fit for purpose against the backdrop of evolving financial and macroeconomic conditions.

AB  - In this paper, we will analyze monetary policy of the Bank of Japan, the central bank of Japan, just after the sales tax hike held in April 2014, through November 2014. The period matches the Japan’s turning point to the recession owing to the sales tax hike in April 2014. With the Abe second Cabinet which started in December 2012, the Bank set the “price stability target” at 2 percent. We analyzed the Monetary Policy Meeting minutes by text mining technologies. Especially we conducted a topic extraction using the Latent Dirichlet Allocation model from the Meeting minutes. The extracted topics clearly showed the impact of the sale tax hike. The biggest topic was the economic conditions related topic and its ratio peaks corresponded to the time of Japan’s GDP data released. In addition, we found that the money easing policy topic ratio increased after the tax hike and that the economic growth related topic ratio showed the decline after the tax hike.

AB  - This paper conducts the first empirical study of the bank balance sheet channel using data on discouraged and informally rejected firms in addition to information on the formal loan granting process. I take advantage of a unique survey data on the credit experience of firms in 8 economies that use the euro or are pegged to it over 2004-2007, and analyze the effect of monetary policy and the business cycle on bank lending and risk-taking. Identification rests on exploiting 1) the exogeneity of monetary policy to local business cycles, and 2) firm-level and bank-level data to separate the supply of credit from changes in the level and composition of credit demand. Consistent with previous studies, I find that lax monetary conditions increase bank credit in general and bank credit to ex-ante risky firms in particular, especially for banks with lower capital ratios. Importantly, I find that the results are considerably stronger when data on informal credit constraints are incorporated.

AB  - This paper provides novel evidence on the role of the macroeconomic environment for households’ choice between fixed-interest-rate and adjustable-interest-rate mortgages (ARMs) in the euro area. We find that relatively more ARMs are taken out when economic growth is strong, the interest rate spread is high, or unemployment shows low volatility. A simulation exercise shows that a reduction in mortgage rates as witnessed during the monetary easing in the course of the global financial crisis produces a substantial decline in debt burdens among mortgage-holding households, especially in countries where households have higher debt burdens and a larger share of ARMs.

T2  - IMF Staff Papers
AB  - Forecasting models for output are presented to throw light on monetary transmission. Recent research finds multistep forecasting superior to recursive forecasting from a VAR model when structural breaks are present; there are important political and policy regime breaks in South Africa. The equilibrium correction models have a four-quarter ahead forecast horizon, appropriate for measuring interest rate effects. A stochastic trend measures underlying shifts in productivity and other supply side trends. The inclusion of important monetary policy regime shifts, which altered the output response to interest rates, and the control for other structural changes (e.g., trade liberalization), address the Lucas critique in forecasting output growth. There are important and persistent effects of high real interest rates, which significantly constrained growth in the 1990s, and significant potential growth benefits from fiscal discipline. South African growth appears to have become more responsive to the exchange rate with increasing trade openness in the 1990s.

AB  - This paper examines the distributional implications of monetary policy from a long-run perspective, with data spanning 100 years of modern economic history in 12 advanced economies. We employ a two-step approach, by estimating a Panel VAR and a single-equation model with local projections, to obtain the dynamic responses of the top 1% income share to a monetary policy shock. We exploit the implications of the macroeconomic policy trilemma, in order to identify exogenous variations in monetary conditions. This offers a genuine orthogonal perspective to capture fluctuations in short term interest rates unrelated to home economic conditions. The obtained results indicate that expansionary monetary policy strongly increases income inequality and vice-versa. These results have important implications for monetary policy coordination and the design of economic policies that aim to reduce income inequality.

AB  - We analyze the impact of monetary policy on cross-border bank flows for a large sample of countries over two decades. We find evidence in favor of a cross-border risk-taking channel, as the monetary policy stance of source countries is an important determinant of cross-border bank flows. A relatively tighter monetary policy in source countries prompts banks to reallocate their lending toward safer foreign counterparties. The cross-border reallocation of credit is more pronounced for source countries with lower-capitalized banks. Also, the reallocation is directed toward foreign borrowers in relatively safer destinations, such as advanced economies or economies with investment-grade sovereign ratings.

TI  - Recent Japanese Monetary Policy: An Evaluation of the Quantitative Easing
AU  - Kurihara, Yutaka
AB  - Japan has experienced unprecedented recession and deflation for more than 10 years, while aggressive fiscal policy was conducted under severe budget constraint during the 1990s and the Bank of Japan enforced unprecedented monetary easing, which reduced interbank interest rates to almost zero. However, because these policies were not enough to end deflation, since 2001, the Bank of Japan has implemented quantitative easing. Even now, there is much dispute over whether the quantitative easing has been effective and whether the quantitative easing achieved the current economic recovery. This paper examines the effect of quantitative easing and finds that it has been effective but limited in scope.

AB  - Maintaining a balance between environmental quality and economic growth is now one of the common goals of fiscal and monetary policies in developed and developing economies. This study examines the asymmetric impacts of fiscal and monetary policy instruments on environmental pollution in Pakistan over the period 1985–2019 by employing the asymmetric or nonlinear autoregressive distributed lag (NARDL) framework. The outcomes indicate that in Pakistan, a positive and negative shock in fiscal policy instruments has a significant increasing influence on carbon emissions in the short run, while a positive and negative shock in fiscal policy instruments has a significant decreasing impact on environmental pollution in long run. However, negative and positive shock in monetary policy instruments enhances carbon emissions in short-run, whereas positive shock in monetary policy instruments decreases carbon emissions in the long run. Therefore, the policymakers may consider the usage of fiscal and monetary policy instruments to maintain economic growth along with lowering the environmental pollution.

TI  - Financing Channels and Monetary Policy in a Dual Banking System: Evidence from Islamic Banks in Indonesia
AU  - Zulkhibri, Muhamed

T2  - Economic Notes
AB  - Using Indonesian Islamic banking data from 2003 to 2014, this article employs a panel regression methodology to investigate the responses of Islamic banks to changes in financing rates and monetary policy, which may differ depending on their characteristics. The results suggest that the financing rate has a negative impact on financing at Islamic banks, while bank-specific characteristics have a positive influence on it. The size and amount of capital have a greater impact than liquidity on financing at Islamic banks. However, changes in monetary policy are insignificant on bank financing, which implies that the transmission of monetary policy through the Islamic segment of the banking sector is weak. Furthermore, the weak impact of monetary policy on bank financing can be explained by the dramatic expansion of Islamic banks during the sample period, which contributed to a substantial increase in deposit growth and a high liquidity position.

AB  - Purpose The purpose of this study is to empirically analyze the role of sukuk in the monetary policy transmission mechanism through the asset price and exchange rate channels in the Indonesian economy. Design/methodology/approach Using the monthly data from January 2003 to November 2017, this study uses a multivariate vector error correction model causality framework. To examine the role of sukuk in the monetary policy transmission mechanism through the asset price channel, this study uses the variables of consumption, inflation, interest rates, economic growth and the composite stock price index. Meanwhile, to examine the role of sukuk in the monetary policy transmission mechanism through the exchange rate channel, this study used variables of inflation, interest rates, economic growth, foreign investment and exchange rate. Findings This study documented that sukuk has no causal relationship with inflation through asset price and exchange rate channels. Nevertheless, sukuk has a bidirectional causal relationship with economic growth through asset price and exchange rate channels. Sukuk is also documented to have a causal relationship with monetary policy variables of interest rate and stock prices through asset price and exchange rate channels. Finally, a unidirectional causality is recorded running from the exchange rate to sukuk in the exchange rate channel. Research limitations/implications The finding of independence of the sukuk market from interest rates provides evidence that the trading of the sukuk in Indonesia has been in harmony with the Islamic tenets. Practical implications The relevant Indonesian authorities need to enhance both domestic and global sukuk markets as part of efforts to promote the sustainability of Islamic capital market development in Indonesia. Originality/value To the best of the authors’ knowledge, this study is among the first attempts to empirically investigate the role of sukuk in monetary policy transmission through asset price and exchange rate channels in the context of the Indonesian economy.

AB  - This study investigates the comparative effect of fiscal and monetary policy on economic growth in Pakistan using annual time series data from 1984 to 2014. The cointegrtion result suggests that both monetary and fiscal policy have significant and positive effect on economic growth. The coefficient of monetary policy is much greater than fiscal policy which implies that monetary policy has more concerned with economic growth than fiscal policy in Pakistan. The implication of the study is that the policy makers should focus more on monetary policy than fiscal to enhance economic growth. The role of fiscal policy can be more effective for enhancing economic growth by eliminating corruption, leakages of resources and inappropriate use of resources. However, the combination and harmonization of both monetary and fiscal policy are highly recommended.

AB  - This study examines how the relationships between local governments and local enterprises moderate the effect of targeted monetary policies through different action-propagating mechanisms. First, we investigate the impact of monetary policies on enterprise investment in areas with different institutional environments. Second, we investigate the impact of monetary policies on state-owned enterprises (SOEs) with different property rights structures. Third, we examine how political connections can influence the action-propagating mechanism of monetary policies. We conclude that in China monetary policies have different effects on SOEs and on private enterprises with or without political connections. Specifically, local government interventions can significantly weaken and distort the effects of monetary policies, such that the intended reduction in investment is noticeably alleviated for SOEs and private enterprises with close links to local governments.

TI  - Monetary Policy Transmission and Bank Lending In South Korea and Policy Implications
AU  - Hsing, Yu
T2  - Asian Economic and Financial Review
AB  - This paper tests the bank lending channel for South Korea based on a simultaneous-equation model consisting of the demand for and the supply of bank loans. The three-stage least squares method is employed in empirical work. The demand for bank loans is negatively associated with the lending rate and positively affected by real GDP and the corporate bond yield. The supply of bank loans has a positive relationship with the lending rate and real bank deposits and a negative relationship with the central bank policy rate, the KRW/USD exchange rate and the 10-year U.S. government bond yield. Therefore, this study finds evidence of a bank lending channel for South Korea. Expansionary monetary policy through a lower policy rate or open market purchase of government bonds to increase bank deposits/reserves would increase bank loan supply.

TI  - Macroeconomic effects of financial stress and the role of monetary policy: a VAR analysis for the euro area
AU  - Kremer, Manfred
T2  - International Economics and Economic Policy
AB  - This paper analyses an otherwise standard macro-financial VAR model for the euro area that includes - apart from conventional measures of output, inflation and monetary policy - a composite indicator of systemic financial stress, namely the CISS index, and total assets of the ECB balance sheet capturing the stance of unconventional monetary policy. I find that the CISS contributes significantly to the dynamics of the macroeconomy and exerts a strong influence on monetary policy when looking at both policy rates and the ECB balance sheet. The significance of the CISS appears robust to the inclusion of a broad set of real and financial control variables. Based on tests of direct versus indirect (Granger-)causality patterns proposed in Hsiao (1982), I also find that unlike unconventional policy as measured by ECB balance sheet growth, the policy rate does not seem to react directly to variations in financial stress but rather indirectly through the impact of financial stress on macroeconomic conditions. These different patterns of reaction are broadly consistent with the ECB’s “separation principle”. The estimated effects of the ECB’s standard and non-standard policy measures on inflation and economic growth are moderate, although an easier stance in both policy tools helps calm down financial stress.

AB  - We evaluate the monetary policy effect on Industrial Output. Data were sourced from World Bank Data Atlas and countries Central Bank Annual bulletin for interest rate (IntR), cash reserve ratio (CRR), inflation rate (INFR), money supply (M2) and manufacturing output (MO) from 1986 to 2021. The used ARDL Co-integration, ARDL regression and ARDL Panel regression. Monetary policy has significant relationship with manufacturing output in the three-individual developing African countries; while, monetary policy was however unable to facilitate a significant change in manufacturing output of the three countries’ economies combined. Thus, industrial output is influenced by monetary policy in the individual countries but does not influence industrial growth in the combined selected developing African economies. Long run relationship exists between monetary policy and industrial output represented by manufacturing output for individual countries and the three countries’ economies combined. Hence, monetary policy has long run effect on manufacturing output of both the individual countries and the three countries combined. Regulatory authorities need to harmonize uniform African cash reserves of banks, interest rates and increase money supply that facilitates easily accessed loans and funds by manufacturing/industrial outlets to enhance manufacturing output in Africa.

AB  - The study examines the impact of fiscal and monetary policy on economic performance and stabilisation in Nigeria, Gambia, and Ghana between 1980 and 2017. In the study, the real gross domestic product and the exchange rate are used to proxy economic performance and economic stabilisation respectively while fiscal policy is captured with deficit finance and government expenditure. Also, the broad money supply and monetary policy rate are used as proxies of monetary policy. The study obtains country-specific results using the fully modified ordinary least squares technique and findings show that monetary policy has insignificant effect on economic performance in Nigeria and the Gambia, but has significant impact in Ghana while fiscal policy significantly enhances economic performance in Nigeria and Gambia, but is insignificant in Ghana. Result also confirms that monetary policy significantly drives economic stabilisation in Nigeria and the Gambia, but insignificantly in Ghana while fiscal policy has insignificant impact on economic stabilisation in Ghana and Gambia, but significant in Nigeria. Thus, we conclude that fiscal policy is relatively more important in stimulating economic performance in Nigeria and Gambia while monetary policy is relatively more important in determining economic performance in Ghana. For economic stabilisation, both fiscal and monetary policies are important in Nigeria, both are ineffective in Ghana, while monetary policy is more important in the Gambia. The study recommends further reductions in monetary policy rate to put less pressure on the exchange rate and stabilise the various economies.

AB  - How does domestic monetary policy in systemic countries spillover to the rest of the world? This paper examines the transmission channel of domestic monetary policy in the cross-border context. We use exogenous shocks to monetary policy in systemically important economies, including the U.S., and local projections to estimate the dynamic effect of monetary policy shocks on bilateral cross-border bank lending. We find robust evidence that an increase in funding costs following an exogenous monetary tightening leads to a statistically and economically significant decline in cross-border bank lending. The effect is weakened during periods of high uncertainty. In contrast, the effect is found to not vary according to the degree of borrower country riskiness, further weakening support for the international portfolio rebalancing channel.

TI  - Monetary policy and redistribution: information from central bank balance sheets in the Euro area and the US
AU  - Cour-Thimann, Philippine
T2  - Review of Economics
AB  - The exceptional measures by central banks during the financial crisis have led to renewed interest in the redistributive effects of monetary policy. This paper adopts the perspective of central bank balance sheets to assess such effects. It uses information from the euro area National Central Banks and the US Federal Reserve Banks to analyse the regional and sectoral effects of monetary policy. Central bank balance sheets capture sustained imbalances in payment flows across the euro area countries that peaked at 10% of GDP in the so-called Target balances, and across the US districts that reached 5% of GDP in the equivalent Interdistrict Settlement Accounts. These imbalances, combined with accommodative central bank liquidity, shifted risks from the private financial sector to the public sector and among taxpayers - yet, mechanisms are in place to mitigate such risks and the associated redistributive effects. The liquidity injection, while directly channelled at the stressed regions or sectors, has indirectly supported the financial sector at large. In different institutional contexts, the financial centres in Germany and in the New York district have been strengthened. They have been net recipients of payment inflows from the rest of the respective currency areas, equivalent in amounts to a third of the liquidity injection during the crisis.

AB  - With the use of non-traditional policy tools, the level of reserve balances has risen in the US from roughly $20 billion before the financial crisis to well past $1 trillion. The effect of reserve balances in macroeconomic models often comes through the money multiplier, affecting the money supply and the bank lending. In this paper, we document that the mechanism does not work through the standard multiplier model or the bank lending channel. If the level of reserve balances is expected to have an impact on the economy, it seems unlikely that a standard multiplier story will explain the effect.

The findings suggest a bidirectional (negative) relationship between bond flows and market returns in the presence of fiscal and monetary policy for developed countries. However, in the case of developing countries, bond flows follow the previous performance of market returns. Moreover, an expansionary monetary stance has a negative impact on bond flows while an expansionary fiscal policy exerts a positive influence on them. In addition, bond funds flourish in times of low economic activity in both developed and developing countries.

AB  - AbstractThe main motives behind the adoption of an inflation targeting regime largely relate to the notion of credibility, transparency of monetary policy and the autonomy of the central bank, which explicitly undertakes to achieve a certain inflation target. This paper examines the effects of inflation targeting in emerging economies in relation to the degree of independence of the central bank and the credibility of monetary policy. We find effects in emerging economies with little central bank independence, so our findings suggest that the central bank’s credibility, transparency and independence is a prerequisite for emerging economies to experience a decline in inflation following the adoption of inflation targeting.

AB  - This paper established that interest rate, inflation, and money supply had negative effects on Nigeria’s economic growth in the short run, while in the long run; exchange rate had significant positive effects. A combination of Breusch-Godfrey Serial Correlation, White Heteroskedasticity, Ramsey Reset, Dickey-Fuller unit root was used for preliminary analysis. Ordinary Least Square (OLS) was used for short run estimate, while a combination of Johansen Co-Integration, Granger Causality Tests and impulse response analysis were used for long run estimation. Our model shows that the four monetary policy variables have 88% joint probability of affecting level economic growth as well as explained 84% of economic growth Nigeria experience for the period 19802012. The paper concludes that for sustainable economic growth to be achieved, monetary authority must devise short term strategies to manage periodic volatility in interest rate, money supply and inflation, while medium and long term strategies must be adopted to stabilize the value of the domestic currency.

TI  - Real Economic Convergence and the Impact of Monetary Policy on Economic Growth of the EU Countries: The Analysis of Time Stability and the Identification of Major Turning Points Based on the Bayesian Methods
AU  - Próchniak, Mariusz

AB  - This study analyzes the time stability of both the GDP beta convergence and the impact of monetary policy variables on economic growth in EU27 countries during 1993-2010 and EU15 during 1972-2010. To address the problem of variables’ selection, Bayesian model pooling (BMP) is used while choosing the appropriate variables for the regression. To loosen the assumption of stability overtime, interaction terms of particular regressors are introduced with time dummies (the whole sample is divided into time intervals and is allowed for structural breaks). To address the problem of potential inconsistency of ‘typical’ estimators, the study employs Blundell and Bond’s GMM system estimator. All the calculations are based on annual data and 3-year intervals. The main findings are: (1) The EU27 countries converged at the rate of about 5-6% per annum while the EU15 countries – at 3% p.a. (2) The pure mechanism of conditional convergence of the countries under study was rather constant over time. (3) The considered economic growth determinants, including all the variables related with monetary policy, exhibited mixed impact on economic growth, especially based on annual data.
