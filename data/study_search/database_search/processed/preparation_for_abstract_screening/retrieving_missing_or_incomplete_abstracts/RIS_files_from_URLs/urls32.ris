AB  - We investigate the effects of U.S. unconventional monetary policies on sovereign yields, foreign exchange rates, and stock prices in emerging market economies (EMEs), and we analyze how these effects depend on country-specific characteristics. We find that, although EME asset prices, mainly those of sovereign bonds, responded strongly to U.S. unconventional monetary policy announcements, these responses were not outsized with respect to a model that takes into account each country's currency regime and vulnerability to U.S. financial conditions.

TI  - Fiscal consequences of structural reform under constrained monetary policy
AU  - Sajedi, Rana
T2  - Journal of Economic Dynamics and Control
T3  - Monetary and Fiscal Policy Stabilization amid a Debt Crisis
AB  - Structural reforms, in particular reductions in mark-ups in product and labour markets, can entail short run output costs unless offset by a demand expansion. When monetary policy is constrained and cannot carry out this short run expansion, there is a potential role for fiscal policy. Although this idea has received a lot of attention in the policy debate, there has been little formal study of the fiscal consequences of reforms under constrained monetary policy. This paper uses a model to quantify the short run fiscal costs and long run fiscal benefits of reforms, in order to see to what extent the latter justify the former. The fiscal costs and benefits of reforms are both generally found to be small, although larger reforms entail larger rises in deficit-to-GDP in the short run. Results suggest that reforms in labour markets have little effect on public finances in the long run, but their short run costs can be ameliorated if combined with product market reforms.

TI  - Why has US monetary policy become ineffective lately?
AU  - Jung, Chulho

T2  - Applied Economics Letters
AB  - Some recent studies show that US monetary policy has lost its stimulative traction, especially since the early 1980s. They argue that the Fed’s forward guidance has enabled economic agents to anticipate the changes in interest rates more accurately. As a result, it is harder to find truly exogenous monetary policy shocks, which has made monetary policy ineffective. In this article, we find that anomalous economic behaviours of financial institutions might be the true reason for the ineffective monetary policy. Our structural vector autoregressive model shows that increases in the US money supply mostly flowed into the financial sector to increase its profits instead of stimulating the real sector of the economy through business investment.

AB  - This study pores over the significance of Fiscal policy and monetary policy that’s describe the effects on environmental issues. With the help of multiple linearregression, we found out the result that clearly explains the impact of fiscal and monetary policy on environmental issues like CO2 emission. We have used three variables, i.e., GDP, exchange rate, and interest rate with CO2 emission. For considering the possible finding on the impact of fiscal and monetary policy according to the pollution sources, we can also distinguish in between the consumptions and productions that are generated by CO2 emissions. The emission of CO2 and that is affected by an increase in the interest rate, and exchange rate and also GDP contributes the great role in affected the environmental issues. The results of ARDL bound testing confirm a strong relationship between fiscal policy, monetary policy economic growth, and CO2 emission in Indonesia. The long-run coefficient further confirms that fiscal and monetary policy is still in phase to enhance the environmental degradation in Indonesia. However, the government should pay extra attention to introduce some innovation in the domain of technology while formulating fiscal policies.

AB  - The investment and stock prices of firms with relatively more intangible assets respond less to monetary policy. Similarly, intangible investment responds less to monetary policy compared to tangible investment. These effects are most pronounced among financially constrained firms, indicating that corporate intangible capital weakens the credit channel of monetary policy transmission. The evidence that higher depreciation rates or higher adjustment costs of intangible assets explain these effects is mixed, suggesting a smaller role for these channels.

AB  - This study sheds new light on the relationship between monetary policy and private investment using Vietnam’s provincial data and a system generalized method of moment (GMM) framework. To capture monetary policy’s effect, different indicators, viz. money supply, domestic credit to the private sector, interest rate and exchange rate are examined. We find that private investment is positively affected by respective monetary policies through broad money, domestic credit and interest rate channels, yet no credible evidence regarding the exchange rate’s effect. In which, such a surprising co-movement between real interest rate and private investment was illuminated through analysis of the economy’s distinctive characteristics over the two development stages (pre- and post-2012). Another notable finding is that economic development prospects of localities, which attract great attention and cause an intense competition between domestic and foreign investors, appear to be a major barrier to investment decisions of private firms.

AB  - Previous infant literature has assessed the symmetric impact of monetary policy uncertainty on a few macro variables. Our study has considered asymmetric monetary policy uncertainty impacts on energy consumption. Our key concern in this study is to regulate whether US monetary policy uncertainty has an asymmetric impact on energy consumption. We employ the symmetric and asymmetric autoregressive distributed lag (ARDL) estimation methods, and we found that monetary policy uncertainty has short- and long-run negative effects on renewable energy consumption in the linear model, while decreased monetary policy uncertainty has a significant negative influence on renewable energy consumption in the USA in the non-linear model. However, in the short and long run, the measure of monetary policy uncertainty has an insignificant impact on non-renewable energy consumption, while increased monetary policy uncertainty in the USA has negative effects and decreased monetary policy uncertainty has positive effects on non-renewable energy consumption in the short and long run in the non-linear model. The effects are asymmetric in direction and magnitude. The study results call for vital changes in renewable and non-renewable energy policies to accommodate monetary policy uncertainties.

TI  - Low Interest Rates and Housing Booms: The Role of Capital Inflows, Monetary Policy and Financial Innovation
AU  - Sá, Filipa

AU  - Wieladek, Tomasz
AB  - A number of OECD countries experienced an environment of low interest rates and a rapid increase in housing market activity during the last decade.  Previous work suggests three potential explanations for these events:  expansionary monetary policy, capital inflows due to a global savings glut and excessive financial innovation combined with inappropriately lax financial regulation.  In this study we examine the effects of these three factors on the housing market.  We estimate a panel VAR for a sample of OECD countries and identify monetary policy and capital inflows shocks using sign restrictions.  To explore how these effects change with the structure of the mortgage market and the degree of securitisation, we augment the VAR to let the coefficients vary with mortgage market characteristics.  Our results suggest that both types of shocks have a significant and positive effect on real house prices, real credit to the private sector and real residential investment.  The responses of housing variables to both types of shocks are stronger in countries with more developed mortgage markets, roughly doubling the responses to a monetary policy shock.  The amplification effect of mortgage-backed securitisation is particularly strong for capital inflows shocks, increasing the response of real house prices, residential investment and real credit by a factor of two, three and five, respectively.

T2  - Research in International Business and Finance
AB  - The study investigates how monetary policy affects bank risk-taking under a multiple-tool regime of Vietnam during 2007–2018. Particularly, we also consider the conditioning role of bank performance, broken down by bank profitability and cost efficiency, in this nexus. Using both dynamic and static panel models, we show that the liquidity injection initiated by the central bank’s asset purchases induces banks to take more risks, captured by the traditional Z-score and two alternative measures of credit risk. However, monetary policy easing through decreased interest rates is beneficial to the credit portfolio and financial stability of banks, which therefore challenges the functioning of the bank risk-taking channel. This startling result is robust across three different interest rate measures, including lending rates, refinance rates and rediscount rates. Further analysis reveals that our observed effects are alleviated for banks with higher performance — i.e., more profitable and efficient banks. This in-depth finding offers more insights into the “search for yield” incentive, based on the theory of information asymmetry and the two competing hypotheses of “bad management” and “cost skimping”.

AB  - Using a sample of A-share listed firms in China during the 2003–2012 period, this paper investigates the effect of accounting conservatism on trade credit, taking changes in monetary policy into account. We find that corporations with higher accounting conservatism obtain more trade credit and that accounting conservatism has a greater influence on trade credit under tight monetary policy. Furthermore, the backgrounds of the supplier and customer influence the positive relationship between accounting conservatism and trade credit. This influence is more evident when a company is privately owned and has greater market power, and less evident when the supplier or customer is the controlling shareholder.

T2  - Economic Policy
AB  - The eurozone economic activity and banking sector have shown substantial fragility over the last years with remarkable country heterogeneity. Using detailed data on lending conditions and standards, we analyse – along several key dimensions of heterogeneity – how financial fragility has affected the transmission mechanism of the single eurozone monetary policy. The analysis shows that the monetary transmission mechanism is time-varying and influenced by the financial fragility of the sovereigns, banks, firms and households. The impact of monetary policy on aggregate output is stronger during the financial crisis, especially in countries facing increased sovereign financial distress. This amplification mechanism, moreover, operates through the credit channel, both the bank lending and the non-financial borrower balance-sheet channels. Our results suggest that the bank-lending channel has been to a large extent neutralized by the ECB non-standard monetary policy interventions, but the policy framework until the end of 2011 was insufficient to overcome credit availability problems stemming from deteriorated firm net worth and risk conditions, especially for small firms in countries under stress.— Matteo Ciccarelli, Angela Maddaloni and José-Luis Peydró

AB  - This letter analyzes the effects of monetary policy on economic growth and income inequality in a Schumpeterian model with heterogeneous households and endogenous step size. We find that a higher nominal interest rate decreases the arrival rate of innovation but increases the step size. Thus, increasing the nominal interest rate has an ambiguous effect on economic growth and income inequality. Under our calibrated values, although monetary policy may have a positive or an inverted-U effect on economic growth, the effect of monetary policy on income inequality remains positive over a wide range of the strength of the CIA constraint.

T2  - Journal of International Money and Finance
AB  - This paper explores the effects of labor and product market reforms in a New Keynesian, small open economy model with labor market frictions and endogenous producer entry. We show that it takes time for reforms to pay off, typically at least a couple of years. This is partly because the benefits materialize through firm entry and increased hiring, both of which are gradual processes, while any reform-driven layoffs are immediate. Some reforms – such as reductions in employment protection – increase unemployment temporarily. Implementing a broad package of labor and product market reforms minimizes transition costs. Importantly, reforms do not have noticeable deflationary effects, suggesting that the inability of monetary policy to deliver large interest rate cuts in their aftermath – either because of the zero bound on policy rates or because of the membership in a monetary union – may not be a relevant obstacle to reform. Alternative simple monetary policy rules do not have a large effect on transition costs.

AB  - The recent financial turmoil renewed interest in whether monetary policy affects the supply side of the credit market.  We show that this credit channel exists — monetary policy affects aggregate loan supply (bank lending channel) and redistributes loan supply across different-sized firms (balance sheet channel).  The effect on aggregate loan supply is driven by banks altering loan maturity, so monetary policy takes time to impact loan supply.  Policy loosening associated with recessions, including the recent one, increased loan supply after about one year.  In the cross-section, the impact is at least as strong for large banks as for small banks.

TI  - The Knowledge Problem in Monetary Policy: The Case for Nominal GDP Targeting
AU  - Beckworth, David
AB  - Monetary policy is hard. In the best of times, it requires a well-informed understanding of the economy and the ability to respond in a timely manner. In less favorable conditions, monetary policy requires near omniscience and the herculean power to stop economic disasters from unfolding.This knowledge problem has been at the heart of the many failures of monetary policy, including the high inflation of the 1970s and the Great Recession of 2007–2009. In both cases, Federal Reserve (Fed) officials lacked the real-time knowledge of the economy they needed to make informed decisions. As a result, their decisions worsened the business cycle.This policy brief shows that a monetary policy rule that aims to stabilize the price level, such aseither a simple inflation target or a flexible inflation target (FIT), will often fail to solve the knowledgeproblem. In contrast, a monetary policy that aims to stabilize the growth of total dollar spending, such as a nominal GDP (NGDP) level target, does solve the knowledge problem and therefore could serve as an effective monetary policy rule.

AB  - The study investigated the effect of monetary policy on oil revenue in Nigeria taking into cognizance the particular effect of the switching from minimum rediscount rate (MRR) to monetary policy rate (MPR) which took effect from December 11, 2006.  The time series data the study employed to examine the pre-adoption effect spanned from 1996 – 2005, while data for post-adoption effect covered the period from 2008 – 2017.   The data were collected on Oil Revenue, Minimum Rediscount rate, Money supply (M2), Treasury bill rate, Exchange rate and Monetary Policy rate.  All data were sourced from the Central Bank website and Statistical Bulletin, 2016.  The OLS technique was employed in analyzing the data and the result indicated that both MRR and MPR had insignificant negative effect on ORV.  Although when the pre-adoption investigation was carried out, MNS had significant positive impact on ORV but in the post-adoption test conducted, the result was significantly negative.  It was an indication that MPR is not any better than the MRR.  Therefore, the study recommends that more strict measures be taken by the Monetary Authority in the Country to review the baseline interest rate which helps to determine money supply.  This will help to curtail the negative effect of money supply on oil revenue.

AB  - Monetary policy transmission may be impaired if banks rebalance their portfolios toward securities. We identify the bank lending and risk-taking channels of monetary policy by exploiting—Italy's unique—credit and security registers. In crisis times, with higher central bank liquidity, less capitalized banks react by increasing securities over credit supply, inducing worse firm-level real effects. However, they buy securities with lower yields and haircuts. Unlike in crisis times, in precrisis times, securities do not crowd out credit supply. The substitution from lending to securities in crisis times helps less capitalized banks repair their balance sheets and restart credit supply with a one-year lag.

AB  - This research work examined Effect of Fiscal and Monetary Policy Instruments on Economic Growth of Nigeria from 1985-2016. The study was anchored mainly on the quantity theory of money. The researcher used secondary data from the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) Statistical Bulletin from 1985-2016. The data collected were analyzed using descriptive statistics such as Mean, Standard Deviation and Skewness and the relationship between the variables of the model was tested using Autoregressive Distributed Lag Model (ARDL) regression analysis after the data was found to be stationary and integrated of different orders. The result of the ARDL regression analysis shows that monetary policy rate having a positive relationship with real gross domestic product is unexpected owing to its ultimate effect on prime lending rate which affects productive economic activities. Government recurrent expenditure was found to have positive significant relationship with economic growth. Accordingly, the long run relationship between monetary policy, fiscal policy instruments and economic growth in Nigeria points to the critical role of the monetary policy decision of the Central Bank of Nigeria and Federal Government fiscal policy programmes on growth and development of economy. This study concludes that monetary policy measured by monetary policy rate and the fiscal policies proxied by government recurrent expenditure have not significantly affected economic growth in Nigeria. It was recommended that the Central Bank of Nigeria should further develop the financial sector through making more funds available to the private sector by reducing monetary policy rate which affects interest rate ceiling on loans to the private sector. And that the Central Bank of Nigeria should further develop the financial sector through making more funds available to the private sector by reducing monetary policy rate which affects interest rate ceiling on loans to the private sector.

TI  - Monetary policy in Japan: Problems and solutions
AU  - Ito, Takatoshi
AU  - Mishkin, Frederic S.
AB  - The Japanese economy has been underperforming for more than a decade. The average growth rate of real GDP over the past 12 years has been just above 1 percent, and the nominal GDP has been shrinking since 1997 due to inflation. Nominal GDP for 2003 is 4 percent below what it was in 1997. In order to stimulate the stagnant economy, the government has cut taxes and increased expenditures. As a result the government debt/GDP ratio has risen to 150 percent, an unprecedented level for an advanced country in peacetime. The CPI has been declining since 1998, while the GDP deflator has been declining since 1995. Stock prices and land prices have been declining for the decade, with the Nikkei 225 index going down in the Spring of 2003 to a low below 8,000, one-fifth of the peak at the end of 1989. There is no doubt that the economy is in deflation. Important questions about the deflation are how much deflation is due to demand factors and how much to supply factors; and whether deflation is a result of stagnant economy or a cause of the stagnation. The conduct of monetary policy by the Bank of Japan in the deflationary environment has been a source of the controversy for the last several years. Inflation or deflation is in the long-run, ultimately a monetary phenomenon. In theory, when the growth rate is below potential and the prices are dropping, monetary policy should be eased without hesitation. This paper will review theoretical and practical issues surrounding the controversy. It will argue that although a recovery of the Japanese economy appears to be underway since 2003, additional monetary policy steps to exit deflation are necessary for the Japanese economy to reach its full potential. The paper is organized as follows. The first section will raise the issues on monetary policy during the deflationary period, 1998-2003. The second section will discuss possible solutions to the deflationary environment in Japan and make recommendations for monetary policy. A final section contains concluding remarks.

AB  - In this paper we investigate the risk-related effects of monetary policy in normal times, as well as in periods where the zero lower bound (ZLB) binds, in a stylized macroeconomic model with boundedly rational beliefs. In our model, financial market participants use heuristics to assess the risk premium over the policy rate in accordance to an “implicit Taylor rule” that measures the stance of conventional monetary policy and which serves as an informative instrument during times when the funds rate is constrained by the ZLB. In such a case, conventional monetary policy is exhausted so that the central bank is forced to use unconventional types of policy. We propose alternative monetary policy measures to help the economy out of the liquidity trap which take into account this assumed form of bounded rationality.

T2  - Margin: The Journal of Applied Economic Research
AB  - Though an accumulating body of work has analysed monetary policy transmission in India, there are few studies examining the asymmetric aspect of the transmission. Against this backdrop, segregating the interest rate setting process captured by a Taylor rule type into unanticipated and anticipated components, this article analyses the asymmetric effects of monetary policy on aggregate demand and its components, and inflation in India using quarterly data from 1996?97Q1 to 2013?14Q3. It finds that unanticipated hikes and cuts in the policy rate have a symmetric impact on aggregate demand, but differentially impact the components. While the impacts on investment are negative and symmetric, they are asymmetric on private consumption, with only an unanticipated cut in policy rate having a significant negative impact. Government consumption is unaffected by monetary policy shocks. The impact of unanticipated interest rate changes on inflation is negative and symmetric. Anticipated policy rate changes also have a negative impact on aggregate demand and its components, except for government consumption, but between certain levels, such changes are ineffective, indicating a neutral impact. Anticipated policy rate changes have a negative impact on inflation at all levels.JEL Classification:C32, C51, E31, E52

AB  - This paper analyses what effects the monetary policy of the European Central Bank have on the economic activity of Eurozone countries. We identify groups of countries which exhibit different economic responses to monetary policy and the factors driving such spatial differences. We distinguish three periods, spanning from 2001 to 2017 and examine conventional as well as unconventional monetary policies in different economic backgrounds of expansion and crisis. We find problems of spatially asymmetric transmission of monetary policy in the period 2008M10–2014M12 and note that different spatial responses might operate in favour of monetary policy or be indifferent to this policy.

AB  - This paper provides evidence on the effects of monetary policy on the income class structure via stimulating economic activity and employment in Euro area countries over the decade after the financial crisis. Based on European Union Statistics on Income and Living Conditions data, we compute the share of the market income obtained by each income class (lower, lower-middle, upper-middle, and upper) for the states that originated the Economic and Monetary Union (EMU-11). We examine the impact of monetary policy impulses under a Bayesian Vector Autoregressive approach and find that a monetary easing shock involving a decrease in nominal interest rates tends to increase the market income share of middle classes at the expense of a smaller income share for the upper class, while the lower class is not significantly affected. Our findings highlight that the identified effects are mostly triggered by short-term interest rate cuts. In fact, these effects tend to vanish as the monetary policy proxy is located further in the yield curve, suggesting that the distributional impacts of monetary policy on market income distribution are to a larger extent driven by monetary policy decisions modifying short-term interest rates.

TI  - Identifying the Effects of Simultaneous Monetary Policy Shocks
AU  - Villamizar-Villegas, Mauricio
T2  - Contemporary Economic Policy
AB  - Many central banks, particularly in the developing world, aim for exchange rate stability as a macroeconomic goal. However, most are reluctant to relinquish monetary policy autonomy, so they end up operating through both interest rate and foreign exchange interventions. But the use of multiple policy instruments does not necessarily equip monetary authorities with better tools to achieve their targets. On the contrary, their effects can potentially offset each other. Using daily data from the Central Bank of Colombia during the period of 1999–2012, I study the effects of simultaneous policies by first deriving new measures of monetary shocks and then determining their impact on economic activity. The main findings indicate that (a) while interest rate interventions have a significant impact on real and nominal variables, foreign exchange interventions tend to have limited effects; and (b) empirical anomalies, such as the positive relationship between output growth, inflation, and the policy rate are eliminated when properly accounting for the systematic responses of policy.

AU  - Breitenlechner, Max

T2  - Economic Modelling
AB  - How do bank loans respond to monetary policy shocks? The bank lending channel holds that banks' refinancing costs are crucial. This paper shows that what ultimately matters are shifts in the supply of funds available to banks. We use a structural VAR and a novel approach that combines data from the market for large certificates of deposits (jumbo CDs) and U.S. macroeconomic data from 1990Q2 to 2016Q4. We identify supply shifts on the jumbo CD market as situations when the volume and price of jumbo CDs respond with opposite signs to policy shocks. Demand shifts are characterized by responses in the same direction. We find that only if policy shocks are associated with a lower supply of funds available to banks, then loan volumes fall immediately and persistently, in line with the bank lending channel. In contrast, loan volumes remain unresponsive if policy shocks shift banks’ demand for funds.

AB  - This paper analyses two-way interactions between monetary policy and inequality in selected advanced economies. In the context of a highly accommodative monetary stance over recent years, the analysis focuses on the effects of monetary policy on inequality over the business cycle via its impacts on returns on assets, the cost of debt servicing and asset prices. While monetary policy easing has a priori ambiguous effects on income and net wealth inequality, in practice these effects are estimated to be small. Cross-country differences in the size and distribution of income and net wealth explain contrasting effects. A house price increase generally reduces net wealth inequality, while the opposite is true for increases in equity and bond prices. Higher inequality can reduce the effectiveness of monetary policy stimulus in boosting private consumption, but such effects are estimated to be small. Cross-country differences in the size and composition of household financial assets rather than in their distribution are more relevant for differences in the effectiveness of monetary policy, especially via the wealth channel.

AB  - We find that monetary policy influenced Turkish bank lending between 1991 and 2007 through the money and bank lending channels. While capital and GDP growth have positive and significant long-run effects on bank loan growth, inflation, bank size and efficiency are not significant determinants. The latter is despite our finding that all Turkish banks’ efficiency improved over the period. Domestic banks are unexpectedly found to be more efficient than foreign banks. With no evident dynamics or fixed-effects in loan growth we prefer the pooled-OLS estimator. We caution against assuming fixed-effects and dynamics are present as this may adversely affect inference.

AB  - We use a panel of quarterly time series observations spanning the period from 1995 to 2000 on Finnish banks to estimate reduced form equations for the growth rate of bank loans. By allowing for individual bank specific effects in the models that we estimate we specifically seek evidence of a bank-lending channel for the transmission of monetary policy shocks in Finland during the latter half of the 1990s. On the basis of our estimation results, we conclude that there is at most weak evidence in favour of the bank-lending channel for monetary policy shocks. Since our data overlaps with the post crisis recovery of the Finnish banking sector with specific government support measures still active during the good part of the sample period, we try to capture the effects of these measures through incorporating a policy dummy variable in our empirical model. This policy dummy enters the estimated equations highly significantly, suggesting that the measures themselves may have contributed to the growth rate of bank loans during the sample period.

We employ the Euro Area Banking Lending Survey to identify the channels. Following identification, we employ the data in a panel vector autoregression model (PVAR) to investigate the pass-through of the standard and nonstandard monetary policy impulses to the gross domestic product (GDP), inflation, and volume of loans. The results imply that channels are interrelated and the broad credit channel is relatively stronger than the bank capital channel, while the relative importance of the bank capital channel is higher in peripheral than core euro area countries.

AB  - This paper aims to enrich the knowledge on the monetary policy transmission mechanism in the new European Union member states with empirical evidence on the impact of monetary policy on bank lending. This work is based on individual bank balance sheet data and covers a sample of commercial banks from 10 Central and Eastern European countries over the period 1998–2006. We follow the approach suggested by Kashyap and Stein (1995) and control for cross-section heterogeneities among banks. The results indicate the existence of asymmetric adjustment of loan quantities with respect to specific bank characteristics. Our findings indicate the existence of a functioning bank-lending channel through small banks. This applies in the short-run to several, but not all, of the analysed banks.

AB  - Conventional wisdom holds that monetary policy in emerging economies is procyclical, unlike in advanced economies. Using a large sample of countries from the mid-1990s onwards, we show that the conduct of monetary policy is not fundamentally different across these two groups of countries. Emerging and advanced economies alike lower their policy rates when economic activity decelerates, both unconditionally and following exogenous U.S. monetary policy tightening. We show that the common practice of using market rates, such as government bond rates, to proxy for the stance of monetary policy leads one to draw inaccurate conclusions about emerging economies’ monetary policy cyclicality due to inherent risk premia in those market rates.

T2  - Journal of Economic Policy Reform
AB  - The main objective of the Bank of Japan’s monetary policy is inflation targeting; however, it may be associated with the recently increased income disparity in Japan. Using the autoregressive distributed lag (ARDL) estimation model, this study conducted in the context of an aging society revealed that the bank’s monetary policy increased income inequality through increased financial asset prices, resulting in a widening of the income gap. We also find that in the long run, the aging population will increase income disparity in Japan; however, tax policy will partially mitigate the adverse effect on income inequality. Unconventional monetary policy will not bring a desirable result for the Japanese economy and the nation as a whole. In addition, the government needs to revise the incremental tax system so that wealthier groups pay more tax than before. In addition, expanding the tax system by adopting the carbon taxation scheme would be beneficial. The government with this kind of tax can pursue two major goals: reducing poverty and environmental pollution, which are ongoing challenges in Japan.

AB  - Nigeria slipped into recession in 2016 and there was need to implement critical measures to move the country out of recession. The central bank of Nigeria (CBN) had to embark on a cycle of policy tightening to curb inflation, this included setting MPR which is the benchmark interest rate at 14%. This has remained unchanged for three consecutive years. GDP recovered after five quarters of continuous contraction recording positive growths of 0.7 and 1.4 percent in quarters two and three of 2017, respectively, which signaled the exit from the recession. This work uses multi-variable regression analysis.

AB  - Using data from 1992 to 2001, we study the impact of members’ economic forecasts on the probability of casting dissenting votes in the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC). Employing standard ordered probit techniques, we find that higher individual inflation and real GDP growth forecasts (relative to the committee’s median) significantly increase the probability of dissenting in favor of tighter monetary policy, whereas higher individual unemployment rate forecasts significantly decrease it. Using interaction models, we find that FOMC members with longer careers in government, industry, academia, non-governmental organizations (NGOs), or on the staff of the Board of Governors are more focused on output stabilization, while FOMC members with longer careers in the financial sector or on the staffs of regional Federal Reserve Banks are more focused on inflation stabilization. We also find evidence that politics matters, with Republican appointees being much more focused on inflation stabilization than Democratic appointees. Moreover, during the entire Clinton administration ‘natural’ monetary policy preferences of Bank presidents and Board members for inflation and output stabilization were more pronounced than under periods covering the administrations of both George H.W. Bush and George W. Bush, respectively.

AB  - The main objective of this paper is to analyze equilibrium and dynamic causality relationships between monetary policy tools and economic growth in Jordan for the period (1990-2017). For this purpose, it considers the autoregressive distributed lag (ARDL) and vector error correction (VEC) models estimations. The results of ARDL approach show that monetary policy variables (i.e., real interest rate and money supply) have positive impact on economic growth in long-run and short-run except inflation rate. In addition, the results of VECM indicate bidirectional causal relationships between economic growth and monetary policy variables in long-run and short-run.

AB  - Systematic differences in the timing of wage-setting decisions among industrialized countries provide an ideal framework to study the importance of wage rigidity for the transmission of monetary policy. Synchronization in wage-setting decisions is prevalent in Japan and the United States, yielding varying degrees of wage rigidity within the year; instead, in France, Germany, and the United Kingdom decisions are more uniformly spread over time. Exploiting within-year variation in the timing of wage-setting decisions in these economies, we find support for the long-held but scarcely tested view that wage rigidity plays a critical role in the transmission of monetary policy.

AB  - This paper examines how competition influences the bank lending channel in the euro area countries. Using a large panel of banks from 12 euro area countries for the period 2002–2010 we analyze the reaction of loan supply to monetary policy actions depending on the degree of bank competition. We find that the effect of monetary policy on bank lending is dependent on bank competition: the transmission of monetary policy via the bank lending channel is less pronounced for banks with extensive market power. Further investigation shows that banks with less market power were more sensitive to monetary policy only before the financial crisis. These results suggest that bank market power has a significant impact on the effectiveness of monetary policy. Therefore, wide variations in the level of bank market power may lead to asymmetric effects of the single monetary policy.

T2  - Journal of International Money and Finance
AB  - The studies regarding the appropriate monetary policy response in defending the domestic currency following a currency crisis do not gather around a robust answer. This study tries to emphasize the notion that there is no single policy applicable for all currency crises happened and happening in the global world. The approach of the study is presenting empirical evidence by focusing separately on the advanced and emerging economies and proving that the monetary policy response for the emerging economies should be different from the advanced economies, depending mainly on the vulnerabilities of these economies preceding and during the crisis periods. The study includes twenty four economies, in which fifteen of them are emerging and nine of them are advanced, for the crisis periods between 1986 and 2009. The main finding of the study is that the tight monetary policy is effective in the advanced economies, and detrimental in the emerging economies faced financial turbulence. The monetary policy has no significance in recent crisis episodes both for advanced and emerging economies. Advanced economies besides having more independent central banking, lower country riskiness and almost no default history; mainly have second generation model weaknesses which cause the increased interest rates to be successful in stabilizing the exchange rates. For the emerging economies the third generation model weaknesses play a major role together with the first generation model vulnerabilities. Thus the major policy implication follows that the policy makers should take into account the economic fragilities during the crisis in implementing the monetary policy.

We examine the effect of monetary policy in the USA, euro area and Japan, on banks’ domestic lending behaviour. Using individual bank-level data we find that financial connections – in the form of lending to and borrowing from the country which changes monetary policy - play an important role in the transmission of foreign monetary policy. We are able to establish evidence for both a bank funding and bank portfolio channel of monetary policy, for both Hong Kong and the UK. These results contrast to the largely inconclusive results from previous studies, whose aggregate nature may have masked offsetting individual bank effects.

Short-term nominal interest rates have been close to zero for more than six years, and the Fed?s balance sheet is currently more than four times as large as in 2007. This article explains how and why the Fed got into this situation and the challenges this creates in returning Fed policy to ?normal??a state in which the Fed?s nominal interest rate target is above zero and its balance sheet is reduced in size.

AB  - We evaluate the ECB's monetary policy strategy against some of the underlying economic features of the eurozone, in normal times and during the financial crisis. We show that in the years preceding the crisis the ECB's emphasis on monetary indicators and deliberate avoidance of excessive activism were justified by the underlying macroeconomic conditions that the ECB faced in the eurozone and contributed to avoid more volatile patterns of inflation and economic activity. After the collapse of financial intermediation in late 2008, the strategy of the ECB was to adopt several non‐standard policy measures. According to our quantitative evaluation of the impact of the main non‐standard policies decided in October 2008 and in May 2009, which notably did not include entering commitments regarding the future path of the policy rate, such measures have significantly contributed to preserving price stability and forestalling a more disruptive collapse of the macroeconomy.— Stephan Fahr, Roberto Motto, Massimo Rostagno, Frank Smets and Oreste Tristani

AU  - G. Goshit, Gideon

T2  - International Journal of Academic Research in Business and Social Sciences
AB  - The paper examines the effectiveness of indirect monetary policy instruments in reducing
poverty in Nigeria using a multiple regression model as well as time series data covering the
period 1986 to 2012. The Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) technique was used in the estimation of
the regression model. The OLS regression result revealed that interest rate (INTR), banking
sector’s credit to the economy (BSCE), bank reserve requirement (BARR), bank liquidity ratio
(BLQR), central bank discount rate (CBDR) and inflation rate (INFR) could not significantly
impact on poverty rate except money supply (MS), real gross domestic product (RGDP),
unemployment rate (UNEMPR) and balance of payment (BOP). A major implication of this result
is that indirect monetary policy instruments alone were grossly inadequate measure/policy to
reduce poverty in Nigeria during the period under review. The paper therefore recommends
that in addition to combining monetary policy with other economic policies (fiscal, income
policies) etc to fight poverty in Nigeria, the monetary authorities as a matter of obligation must
strengthens banking rules and regulations to enhance compliance with CBN’s rules and
directives by commercial banks in order to further facilitate and enhance the effectiveness of
monetary policy instruments in the economy in order to influence poverty reduction in Nigeria.

TI  - The effects of systematic monetary policy on sectors: a factor model analysis
AU  - Cimadomo, Jacopo
AB  - This paper studies the monetary policy transmission to sectors in the US economy. A recent literature has stressed the importance of focusing on disag-gregate variables in order to investigate if monetary shocks have distributional and asymmetric effects across economic entities, if they change relative prices and the composition of economic activity. This work proposes an approach to analyse the sectorial sensitivity to the systematic or endogenous component of monetary policy. We focus on the systematic component of monetary pol-icy for three main reasons: i) if expectations are not perfectly rational or if there are some friction in the market, systematic monetary policies do have real effects. ii) the systematic component of monetary policy is likely to be im-portant in explaining business cycle ßuctuations iii) shocks may be interpreted simply as measurement errors or may be due to an incorrect speciÞcation of the rule. The econometrics is based on factor model econometric framework a la Forni, Hallin, Lippi and Reichlin (2000), Stock and Watson (1999). A factor model analysis allows to exploit the covariance structure among hundreds of time series and to overcome some drawbacks of VAR literature, when the focus is on disaggregate variables. We Þnd that systematic monetary policy affects the economy heterogeneously and that there is a positive and strong correla-tion between the sensitivity to endogenous monetary policy and degree of price rigidity: Industrial Machinery, Primary Metals and Electrical Machinery are the most sensitive, Textile, Lumber and Food industries the least. * I especially wish to thank Professor Lucrezia Reichlin for comments and discussions.

AB  - There are strong priori reasons to believe that monetary transmission may be weaker and less reliable in low- than in high-income countries. This is as true in India as it is elsewhere. While its floating exchange rate gives the RBI monetary autonomy, the country’s limited degree of integration with world financial markets and RBI’s interventions in the foreign exchange markets limit the strength of the exchange rate channel of monetary transmission. The country lacks large and liquid secondary markets for debt instruments, as well as a well-functioning stock market. This means that monetary policy effects on aggregate demand would tend to operate primarily through the bank lending channel. Yet the formal banking sector is small, and does not intermediate for a large share of the economy. Moreover, there is evidence that not only are the costs of financial intermediation high but also that the banking system may not be very competitive. The presence of all these factors should tend to weaken the process of monetary transmission in India. This paper examines what the empirical evidence has to say about the strength of monetary transmission in India, using the structural vector autoregression (SVAR) methods that have been applied broadly to investigate this issue in many countries, including high-, middle-, and low-income ones. We estimate a monthly VAR with data from April 2001 to December 2014. Applying a variety of methods to identify exogenous movements in the policy rate in the data, we find consistently that positive shocks to the policy rate result in statistically significant effects (at least at confidence levels typically used in such applications) on the bank lending rate in the direction predicted by theory. Specifically, a tightening of monetary policy is associated with an increase in bank lending rates, consistent with evidence for the first stage of transmission in the bank lending channel. While pass-through from the policy rate to bank lending rates is in the right (theoretically expected) direction, the pass-through is incomplete. When the monetary policy variable is ordered first, effects on the real effective exchange rate are also in the theoretically expected direction on impact, but are extremely weak and not statistically significant, even at the 90 % confidence level, for any of the four monetary policy variants that we investigate. Finally, we are unable to uncover evidence for any effect of monetary policy shocks on aggregate demand, as recorded either in the industrial production (IIP) gap or the inflation rate. None of these effects are estimated with strong precision, which may reflect either instability in monetary transmission or the limitations of the empirical methodology. Overall, the empirical tests yield a mixed message on the effectiveness of monetary policy in India, but perhaps one that is more favorable than is typical of many countries at similar income levels.

TI  - Monetary Policy Transmission in Nepal
AU  - Budha, Birendra Bahadur
AB  - This paper examines the monetary policy transmission in Nepal based on the data for the period 2002-2015. As a first step in the analysis, the paper analyzes the issue of inflation convergence and the monetary independence in the context of the existing exchange rate peg and the capital flow policy of Nepal. The paper employs a number of macro indicators, and alternative empirical strategies based on the peculiarities of Nepal. The results show that the existing exchange rate peg has resulted in the convergence of the Nepalese price level to the Indian price level in the long-run. Despite the peg, there is an evidence of the independence of the Nepalese monetary policy to a large extent. The narrative approach of identifying monetary policy shows the evidence of the bank lending channel, interest rate channel, and the asset price channel of the Nepalese monetary policy though there exists a lag in monetary policy transmission due to high information asymmetry, adjustment costs and the poor financial infrastructure. In addition, the SVAR approach provides the evidence of the monetary policy transmission, in which the effect of the expansionary monetary policy on the gross domestic product decays to zero at about 8 quarters. Moreover, the paper also shows that the money market liquidity is largely guided by the remittance inflows in recent years. The analysis of the money market development indicates the need for the review of the operating procedures and the implementation aspects of the monetary policy. The evidence of monetary transmission channels implies that NRB can use its policy to achieve the specified objectives over certain time horizon.

TI  - Does the IMF Influence Fiscal and Monetary Policy?
AU  - Dreher, Axel
T2  - The Journal of Policy Reform
AB  - In theory, the IMF could influence fiscal and monetary policy via several channels, among them advice to policy makers, conditionality, and the moral hazard it induces with the borrowers. This article tries to disentangle those effects empirically. Using panel data for 98 countries over the period 1975–2000 it analyzes whether IMF involvement indeed influences fiscal and monetary policy in program countries. There is evidence that participation in IMF Standby and Extended Fund Facility arrangements improves economic policy. Money disbursed and the degree to which a program is implemented does not have any systematic influence. The same is true for future availability of resources as measured by exhaustion of a country’s quota with the Fund. The final section discusses policy implications.

T2  - International Finance
AB  - This paper investigates how monetary policy affects bank profitability. We use data for 109 large international banks headquartered in 14 major advanced economies for the period 1995–2012. Overall, we find a positive relationship between the level of short-term rates and the slope of the yield curve (the ‘interest rate structure’, for short), on the one hand, and bank profitability – return on assets – on the other. This suggests that the positive impact of the interest rate structure on net interest income dominates the negative one on loan loss provisions and on non-interest income. We also find that the effect is stronger when the interest rate level is lower and the slope less steep, that is, when non-linearities are present. All this suggests that, over time, unusually low interest rates and an unusually flat term structure erode bank profitability.

AB  - This paper examines the interaction of monetary and fiscal policies using an estimated New-Keynesian dynamic general equilibrium model for the US. In contrast to earlier work using VAR models, we show that the strategic complementarity or substitutability of fiscal and monetary policy depends crucially on the types of shocks hitting the economy, and on the assumptions made about the underlying structural model. We also demonstrate that countercyclical fiscal policy can be welfare-reducing if fiscal and monetary policy rules are inertial and not co-ordinated.

AB  - We consider a general equilibrium model with frictions in credit markets used by households. In our economy, houses provide housing services to consumers and serve as collateral to lower borrowing cost. We show that this amplifies and propagates the effect of monetary policy shocks on housing investment, house prices and consumption. We also consider the effect of a structural change in credit markets that lowers the transaction costs of additional borrowing against housing equity. We show that such a change would increase the effect of monetary policy shocks on consumption, but would decrease the effect on house prices and housing investment.

AB  - The effectiveness of fiscal and monetary policy has been the center of debate between Keynesians and the monetarists for a long time. However, the results from numerous empirical studies are inconclusive, suggesting that none of the policies can be thought of as superior to the other and their relative effectiveness in any economy depends on the prevailing economic and political conditions at any point in time. In order to determine the influence of fiscal and monetary policy on the economic activity in Serbia, we employed unit root and cointegration tests, as well as the regression analysis on the series of quarterly data for the period 2003-2012. The obtained results show that monetary policy is more effective in stimulating economic growth comparing to fiscal policy. Hence, the overall conclusion is that government should pay more attention to the fiscal policy to improve its efficiency in the future.

TI  - MONETARY POLICY TOWARDS INCLUSIVE GROWTH: THE CASE OF KOREA
AU  - Chang, Dongkoo
AB  - This paper investigates the impact of interest rate policy on employment using Korean data
(1982.1/4~2012.4/4). Based on the analyses of impulse response functions, it was found that
interest rate policy has a bigger impact on the cyclical component of employment than on total
employment. The shrinking effect of employment by a hike in interest rate is estimated to be larger
in contrast to the expanding effect of employment as a result of declining interest rate.
Interestingly, most of the effect of interest rate on employment is realized through wage workers
and manufacturing sector employment rather than non-wage workers or service sector
employment. In this regard, in order to expand total employment and keep it at a desire level, to
enable inclusive growth, it is essential to reduce the volatility of the policy rate and maintain
interest rate at a long-term neutral level for a prolonged period and to reduce exchange rate
volatility created by changes in interest rate. In particular, it is necessary to ensure that exchange
rate does not appreciate too much, so as to avoid over-shooting of the exchange rate in order to
reduce the volatility of manufacturing sector employment when interest rates are on the rise.

AB  - The introduction of the Liquidity Adjustment Facility as an operating procedure for monetary policy in the post-reform period is a landmark event for monetary policy. This paper finds a structural break in the post-reform period corresponding to the introduction of LAF in 2000. Using Vector Auto Regression techniques on monthly data from April 1993 to March 2012, the paper also assesses the changing importance of various transmission channels of monetary policy in the pre-LAF and post-LAF periods. It is found that the bank lending channel remains an important means of transmission of monetary policy in India, but it has weakened in the post-LAF period. The interest rate and asset price channels have become stronger and the exchange rate channel, although weak, shows a mild improvement in the post-LAF period.

AB  - This article analyses the effects of bank-specific characteristics, bank specialization and portfolio concentrations on the transmission of monetary policy via the bank-lending channel in Malaysia, a fairly well-developed financial system, using the dynamic panel regression estimation. The results provide evidence in favour of the bank-lending channel theory that the bank-lending channel operating via small- and low-liquidity banking entities. Furthermore, the evidence suggests that the dividing lines between different categories of financial institutions distinguished by differences in both market and regulatory structures, influence the way the financial institutions react to a monetary policy shock, of which finance companies react stronger than commercial banks. The results also suggest that banks with a higher level of corporate loan concentration experience greater financial constraint and limited access to other source finance.

TI  - What Role do Banks play in Monetary Policy Transmission in EU Accession Countries?
AU  - Schmitz, Birgit
AB  - After the accession of the candidate countries to the European Union in 2004, the European Central Bank will need to pursue monetary policy in an enlarged euro zone. I empirically investigate the role of banks in monetary policy transmission in the accession countries. Banks are of major importance for the financing of firms and thus the adjustment of their lending in response to monetary policy actions potentially constitutes an important channel through which monetary policy works. Banks are exposed to problems of asymmetric information therefore it is shown that a change in interest rates has distributional effects across banks facing different degrees of informational asymmetries. This paper tests the prediction that banks differ in the characteristics such as relative size, level of liquidity, capitalization and ownership structure contributing to various reactions in response to monetary tightening.

T2  - Studies in Economics and Finance
AB  - Purpose – This paper aims to examine the controversial issue of the extent to which Federal Reserve monetary policy may have contributed to the recent housing crisis and subsequent adverse macroeconomic developments. Design/methodology/approach – The authors develop a small model that facilitates OLS and VAR estimates of the critical period. Findings – The empirical results support the claim of John B. Taylor and others who held that monetary policy was excessively stimulative in terms of the low fed funds rate 2002‐2005, but also support the view of Alan Greenspan and others that the linkages between short‐term rates, long‐term rates, and the housing market deteriorated during that decade. Originality/value – The model includes the Taylor Rule, a housing equation, and a mechanism linking the two relationships. The empirical results support elements of the camp that blames monetary policy for the recent housing crisis, and elements of the opposing camp which limits policy culpability. Specifically, it suggests excessive monetary ease and a structural change (for which the Fed cannot be blamed) in the monetary policy‐housing market linkage that occurred prior to the crisis. The results also support long‐term, prior crisis, channels of influence that run from the state of the economy to fed funds rates to mortgage interest rates to housing prices. A return to normalcy in the housing market should be accompanied by the re‐establishment of these channels.

AB  - The impact of monetary policy in large advanced countries on emerging market economies—dubbed spillovers—is hotly debated in global and national policy circles. When the U.S. resorted to unconventional monetary policy, spillovers on asset prices and capital flows were significant, though remained smaller in countries with better fundamentals. This was not because monetary policy shocks changed (in size, sign or impact on stance). In fact, the traditional signaling channel of monetary policy continued to play the leading role in transmitting shocks, relative to other channels, affecting longer-term bond yields. Instead, we find that larger spillovers stem more from structural factors, such as the use of new instruments (asset purchases). We obtain these results by developing a new methodology to extract, separate, and interpret U.S. monetary policy shocks.

AB  - This paper assesses the effects of the most recent monetary policy behaviour of the Bank of Japan (in particular, zero interest rate policy and negative interest rate policy) and Japanese tax policy on income inequality in this country during the period of 2002Q1 to 2017Q3. The vector error correction model (VECM) that develops in this research shows that increase in money stock (m1) through Quantitative Easing (QE) and Quantitative and Qualitative Easing (QQE) policies of the BOJ significantly increases the income inequality. On the contrary, Japanese tax policy was effective in reducing the income inequality. Variance decomposition results show that increasing of income inequality by monetary policy is larger when comparing to decreasing effects of tax policy on income inequality. Cointegration and VECM results show that monetary policy has both short-run and long-run impacts but for tax policy paper could not find any significant short-run impact on income inequality. In addition, paper found that technological progress only in long-run can reduce the income inequality by increasing the marginal productivity of labour with positive impacts on employment and wages.

AB  - This paper analyzes Pakistan's monetary policy transmission mechanism by considering these channels: Interest rate Channel, Credit Channel, and Risk channel. In this study, an innovative channel, Risk Channel, is introduced to measure its impact on the monetary policy transmission mechanism by covering the annual time data from 1995 to 2020for Pakistan. This paper aims to examine the long-run and the short-run relationship between foreign debt, bank capital, and monetary policy transmission mechanism. To fulfill this objective, we intended to use Autoregressive Distributed Lag (ARDL) model to investigate long-run and short-run relations. As per the result, the risk channel represents that it is not following the cointegration benchmark. The coefficient is negative, but the probability is more significant than 0.05, which is statistically insignificant; therefore, there is no long-run relationship between the model variables. The interest rate channel represents that it ensures the benchmark of cointegration as the coefficient is negative, but the probability is less than 0.05, which is statistically significant; therefore, there is a long-run relationship between variables for the model. The credit channel represents that it ensures the cointegration benchmark as the coefficient is negative and statistically significant at 90%; therefore, there is a long-run relationship between variables for the model. However, the study concluded that risk channel has short-term relation and interest rate&amp; credit channels have short-term and long-term relationships.

AB  - This paper discusses key issues related to the conduct of monetary policy in countries that have Islamic banks. It describes the macrofinancial background and monetary policy frameworks where Islamic banks typically operate, and discusses the monetary transmission mechanism in economies where Islamic and conventional banking coexist. Most economies with Islamic banks also have conventional banks and this calls for a comprehensive approach to monetary policy. At the same time, a dual approach to monetary policy should be considered whenever the Islamic segment of the financial system is not as developed as the conventional one. The paper tries to shed light on potential spillovers between conventional and Islamic financial systems, and proposes specific recommendations on the design of Islamic monetary policy operations and for facilitating monetary transmission through the Islamic financial system.

AB  - This paper evaluates the usefulness of a McCallum monetary policy rule based on money supply for maintaining price stability in mainland China. We examine whether excess money relative to rule-based values provides information that improves the forecasting of price developments. The results suggest that our monetary variable helps in predicting both consumer and corporate goods price inflation, but the results for consumer prices depend on the forecasting period. Nevertheless, growth of the Chinese monetary base has tracked the McCallum rule quite closely. Moreover, results using a structural vector autoregression suggest that our measure of excess money supply could be used to identify monetary policy shocks in the Chinese economy.

This finding is robust across countries, conditioning variables, and time periods. We study the implications for monetary policy in a reduced-form New Keynesian model with financial intermediaries that are subject to a Value at Risk (VaR) constraint. Optimal monetary policy depends on the magnitude of downside risk to GDP, as it impacts the consumption-savings decision via the Euler constraint, and financial conditions via the tightness of the VaR constraint. The optimal monetary policy rule exhibits a pronounced response to shifts in financial conditions for most countries in our sample. Welfare gains from taking financial conditions into account are shown to be sizable.

TI  - Fiscal policy, monetary policy and external imbalances: Cross-country evidence from Africa's three largest economies
AU  - Bonga-Bonga, Lumengo
T2  - The Journal of International Trade & Economic Development
AB  - This paper determines which of the three policy approaches: fiscal, monetary and exchange rate can better address external imbalances in the three largest African economies, Nigeria, South Africa and Egypt. To this end, use is made of the panel vector autoregressive model to assess the dynamic effects of shocks emanating from the three policy approaches. The findings of the paper indicate that unlike in many emerging and developed economies the current accounts of these three economies react to fiscal, monetary and exchange rate shocks. More particular, the results of the empirical analysis show that the appreciations of the currencies in the three economies lead to current account surpluses. This is mainly attributed to the fact that most African economies have a high propensity to import with limited productive capacity for exports.

We assess different paths of monetary policy normalization based on expectations of members and participants of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), the US Federal Reserve's policy-making body. In the medium term, we find considerable negative effects on world GDP but only moderate effects on international prices. These negative spillovers are not confined to emerging economies but tend to carry over to other industrialized economies as well.

AB  - We provide evidence on how banks and non-bank financial intermediaries differ in their response to monetary policy. Our findings are based on a standard empirical macro model for the euro area, augmented with balance sheet data for banks and investment funds. The model is estimated via local projections, using high-frequency methods to identify different types of monetary policy shocks. Short-rate shocks lead to a significant balance sheet response of banks and investment funds, with a slightly swifter and more persistent reaction of banks. Long-rate shocks instead exert only short-lived effects on bank balance sheets, whereas investment fund balance sheets exhibit a stronger and more persistent response. The relative role of different types of financial intermediaries hence emerges as a relevant factor in shaping the transmission process for conventional and non-standard monetary policy measures.

AB  - In this paper, we (1) examine the interactions of financial variables and the macroeconomy within the block-restriction vector autoregression model and (2) evaluate to what extent the financial variables improve the forecasts of GDP growth and inflation. For this reason, various financial variables are examined, including those unexplored in previous literature, such as the share of liquid assets in the banking industry and the loan loss provision rate. Our results suggest that financial variables have a systematic and statistically significant effect on macroeconomic fluctuations. In terms of forecast evaluation, financial variables in general seem to improve the forecast of macroeconomic variables, but the predictive performance of individual financial variables varies over time, even though it strengthens during the 2008–2009 crisis. The results give some support for the risk-taking channel of monetary policy, as the level of the monetary policy rate is positively associated with the loan loss provision rate of commercial banks. Finally, a more stable financial system is found to contribute to faster economic growth.

Results reveal evidence of cointegration between the real GDP and its determinants, namely shortterm interest rate, exchange rate and claims on private sectors that take into account three key transmission mechanisms channels in the conduct of monetary policy, namely the interest rate, exchange rate and credit channels. While asset price channel is found to be insignificant. The monetary conditions during the study periods is reflected in the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas’s reaction to the prevailing economic situation, imply that the AMCI tracks the inverse movements of the real GDP growth reasonably well after 1990s. Possible light of policy implications have put forward.

The empirical results show a significant effect of monetary policy via the bank lending channel of monetary policy in Thailand. This effect of monetary policy is higher especially in bank with larger size as well as bank with lower capitalisation. Financial market development, including the banking sector development and the capital market development, mainly weakens the effect of monetary policy through the bank lending channel in Thailand.

AB  - This study examines the relative efficacy of monetary policy transmission channels in Tanzania. The study applied co-integration and error correction modeling approach to analyze the short-run and long-run comparative effects of five monetary policy transmission mechanisms on economic growth. The study found that growth-effects of monetary policy depends on transmission channels used. The results show that interest rate channel and stock price channel are not effective in Tanzania. The results further show that though the bank credit channel is working, it is weak. Moreover, the results reveal that exchange rate and expected inflation are the dominant transmission channels of monetary policy in Tanzania. Thus, to enhance interest rate, stock price, and bank credit channels concerted efforts are required to increase financial inclusion in Tanzania.  The central bank, commercial banks, financial markets, and other players should continue increasing access and range of financial services; revising lending procedures to private sector; and devise strategies to encourage more economic agents, preferably the domestic investors, to participate in the stock exchange market. In addition, there is a need for the central bank to closely continue monitoring inflation and exchange rates as the dominant monetary policy transmission mechanisms.

T2  - The Journal of Developing Areas
AB  - The seminal 1968 paper of Anderson and Jordan on the relative effectiveness of monetary and fiscal policy on output stabilization caused many debates among both economists and policy makers. This paper uses a standard unrestricted VAR (vector autoregression) model to analyze the above relationship for five SAARC (South Asian Association of Regional Cooperation) countries (Bangladesh, India, Nepal, Pakistan and Sri Lanka) over the period of 1974-2007. In a system of five-equation of VAR model, this paper reveals that money supply, government expenditure, the real exchange rate and the foreign interest rate are co-integrated for all countries. The results of both the VD (Variance decomposition) and the IRFs (Impulse response functions) indicate that monetary policy has been more effective on output than fiscal policy in the case of Pakistan and Sri Lanka, whereas fiscal policy has had a more powerful effect than monetary policy on Bangladesh, India and Nepal.

TI  - Monetary Policy and Household Deleveraging
AU  - Harding, Martin
AU  - Klein, Mathias
AB  - This study investigates the interrelation between the household leverage cycle, collateral constraints, and monetary policy. Using data on the U.S. economy, we find that a contractionary monetary policy shock leads to a large and significant fall in economic activity during periods of household deleveraging. In contrast, monetary policy shocks only have insignificant effects during a household leveraging state. These results are robust to alternative definitions of leveraging and deleveraging periods, different ways of identifying monetary policy shocks, controlling for the state of the business cycle, the level of households debt, and financial stress. To provide a structural interpretation for these empirical findings, we estimate a monetary DSGE model with financial frictions and occasionally binding collateral constraints. The model estimates reveal that household deleveraging periods in the data on average coincide with periods of binding collateral constraints whereas constraints tend to turn slack during leveraging episodes. Moreover, the model produces an amplification of monetary policy shocks that is quantitatively comparable to our empirical estimates. These findings indicate that the state-dependent tightness of collateral constraints accounts for the asymmetric effects of monetary policy across the household leverage cycle as found in the data.

AB  - This paper proposes an assessment of the monetary policy performed by the European Central Bank (ECB) and, more specifically this paper investigates to what extent the ECB monetary policy decisions were guided by financial instability signals. Our assessment is achieved by estimating a Taylor's rule, augmented by financial instability aggregate indicators. This estimate enables us, on the one hand, to compare the fitted model predictions against the observed interest rate and, on the other hand, to decompose the setup of the key rate based on these different determinants. Using a sample of data related to the Euro area, we show that financial and banking instability impact on the key interest rate setup. Consideration of instability indicators brings forward a clear improvement of the Taylor's rule, mainly for the second period of the sample. This is because, at the beginning of the ECB, instability counted for one third of the explanation of the interest rate rule, and over the recent period (starting with the last quarter of 2005, up to 2009), for more than 54%.

TI  - Commodity Prices, Monetary Policy, and Inflation
AU  - De Gregorio, José
T2  - IMF Economic Review
AB  - During the second half of the 2000s, the world experienced a rapid and substantial rise in commodity prices. This shock posed complex challenges for monetary policy, in particular because of the significant increase in food and energy prices, and the repercussions they had on aggregate inflation measures. This paper discusses the role of commodity price shocks (CPS) in monetary policy in the light of recent episodes of such shocks. It begins by discussing whether monetary policy should target core or headline inflation, and what should be the role of CPS in setting interest rates. It is argued that there are good reasons to focus on headline inflation, as most central banks actually do. Although core inflation provides a good indicator of underlying inflation pressures, the evolution of commodity prices should not be overlooked, because of pervasive second-round effects. This paper reviews the evidence on the rise of inflation across countries and reports that food inflation, more than energy inflation, has relevant propagation effects on core inflation. This finding is particularly important in emerging market economies, where the share of food in the consumer basket is significant. The evidence also shows that countries that had lower inflation during the run up of commodity prices before the global crisis had more inflation in the subsequent rise after the global crisis, suggesting that part of the precrisis inflationary success may have been because of repressed inflation. This paper also discusses other factors that may explain different inflationary performances across countries.

TI  - Financial Regulation, Monetary Policy, and Inflation in the Industrialized World
AU  - Copelovitch, Mark S.

T2  - The Journal of Politics
AB  - This article argues that the institutional mandates of central banks have an important influence on inflation outcomes in the advanced industrialized countries. Central banks that are also responsible for bank regulation will be more sensitive to the profitability and stability of the banking sector and therefore less likely to alter interest rates solely on the basis of price stability objectives. When bank regulation is assigned to a separate agency, the central bank is more likely to enact tighter monetary policies geared solely toward maintaining price stability. An econometric analysis of inflation in 23 industrial countries from 1975 to 1999 reveals that inflation is significantly higher in those countries with central banks that are vested with bank regulatory responsibility, although this effect is conditional on the choice of exchange rate regime and the relative size of the banking sector. We also conduct a case study of the Bank of England, which lost its bank regulatory authority to a new agency in 1998. We find that the new Labour government under Tony Blair imposed the institutional change on the Bank of England in part to remove the bank stability bias from its monetary policymaking. These findings suggest that the mandates of central banks not only have important influences on macroeconomic outcomes, but may also be modified in the future by governments seeking to impose their own monetary policy preferences.

(QE) and other unconventional monetary policies on price and
wage growth expectations of UK manufacturing firms. To identify the effect of QE on firms’ expectations, we use a novel
approach of combining microeconometric data with macroeconomic shocks: QE is exogenous to inflation expectations
of individual firms, and so are other macroeconomic developments like aggregate inflation or GDP growth. We find that
firms’ price and wage inflation expectations increase by 0.22
percentage points in response to £50 billion of QE, implying that inflation expectations are part of the transmission
mechanism of QE. In contrast, we find a positive but small
and insignificant effect of forward guidance on price and wage
inflation expectations.

AB  - This paper investigates the effects of monetary policy under the crawling peg in Colombia utilizing Granger Causality tests, variance decompositions, and impulse response functions from VARs. Several alternative lag selection criteria are used to specify the lag structures of the VARs. Variations in domestic credit appear to affect the balance of payments but not the exchange rate in Colombia, suggesting that the crawling peg has functioned more like a fixed than a flexible exchange rate. The size of the balance of payments offset is relatively large, but the models differ on its size. Domestic credit appears to have a weak effect on national output. Neither domestic credit nor the exchange rate play much of a role in explaining variation in inflation in Colombia. Inflation appears to be primarily inertial and the result of demand shocks. The results are consistent with the recent difficulties encountered in maintaining monetary targets in Colombia, and the persistence of inflation under contractionary monetary policy.

AB  - This Paper provides a discussion of some aspects of aggregate supply and demand determination in the United Kingdom. It argues that: (1) UK policymakers in the 1960s and 1970s did not use the downward-sloping Phillips curve as a model of inflation or a guide to policy. The explanation proposed by Sargent (1999) for the US Great Inflation is therefore unlikely to account for the Great Inflation in the UK. (2) The proposition that inflation is a monetary phenomenon is fully consistent with the use of models in which money and other measures of monetary policy stance do not appear in the price-setting equations. (3) The UK exhibits a relationship between output and short-term real interest rates that is quite distinct from that observed in the US.
