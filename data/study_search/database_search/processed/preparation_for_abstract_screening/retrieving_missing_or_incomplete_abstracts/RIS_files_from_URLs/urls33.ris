AB  - Monetary policy tools, including money supply and interest rate, are the most popular instruments to control inflation around the globe. It is assumed that a tight monetary policy, either in form of reduction in money supply or an increase in interest rate, will reduce inflation by reducing aggregate demand in an economy. However, monetary policy could be counterproductive if cost side effects of monetary tightening prevail. High energy prices may increase the cost of production by reducing aggregate supply in the economy. If tight monetary policy is used to reduce this cost push inflation, the cost side effect of energy prices will add to cost side effects of monetary tightening and will become dominant. In this case, the monetary policy could be counterproductive. Furthermore, simultaneous reduction in aggregate supply and aggregate demand will bring twofold reduction in output. Therefore greater care is needed in the use of monetary policy in the situation of cost push inflation. This article investigates the presence of cost side effect of monetary transmission mechanism, the role of international oil prices in domestic inflation, and implications for monetary policy. The findings suggest that both monetary policy and oil prices have cost side effects on inflation and monetary tightening could be counterproductive if used to reduce energy pushed inflationary trend.

T2  - Journal of Money, Credit and Banking
AB  - This paper uses multiple cointegration analysis to estimate simultaneously a monetary reaction function and the determinants of expected inflation for Brazil, Chile, Colombia, and Mexico. In addition, M-GARCH modeling is used to test for the presence of volatility spillovers between the monetary stance and inflation expectations. The analysis shows that there are long-term relationships between the interest rate, expected inflation, and the inflation target, and that greater volatility in the monetary stance increases the volatility of expected inflation in Brazil, Colombia, and Mexico.

TI  - Monetary Policy, Firms’ Inflation Expectations and Prices: Causal Evidence from Firm-Level Data
AU  - Bottone, Marco

AB  - We empirically explore the direct and immediate response of firms’ inflation expectations to monetary policy shocks. We use the Bank of Italy’s quarterly Survey of Inflation and Growth Expectations, in operations since 2000,  and compare average point inflation expectations of firms interviewed in the days following scheduled ECB Governing Council meetings with those of firms interviewed just before them; we then relate the difference we find to the change in the nominal market interest rates recorded on Governing Council meeting days, a gauge of the unanticipated component of monetary policy communications. We find that unanticipated changes in market rates are negatively correlated in a statistically significant way with the differences in inflation expectations between the two groups of firms and that this effect has become stronger since 2009. We do not find evidence that firms’ pricing plans are affected by these monetary policy shocks nor that firms perceive significant changes in the main determinants of their pricing choices.

AB  - We introduce subsistence requirements in food consumption into a simple new-Keynesian model with flexible food and sticky non-food prices. We study how the endogenous structural transformation that results from subsistence affects the dynamics of the economy, the design of monetary policy, and the properties of inflation at different levels of development. A\ calibrated version of the model encompasses both rich and poor countries and broadly replicates the properties of inflation across the development spectrum, including the dominant role played by changes in the relative price of food in poor countries. We derive a welfare-based loss function for the monetary authority and show that optimal policy calls for complete (in some cases near-complete) stabilization of sticky-price non-food inflation, despite the presence of a food-subsistence threshold. Subsistence amplifies the welfare losses of policy mistakes, however, raising the stakes for monetary policy at earlier stages of development.

T2  - International Journal of Finance & Economics
AB  - We examine how inflation and the costs associated with disinflation episodes are related to monetary policy transparency. We develop a simple model that demonstrates how transparency may result in lower inflation. Our empirical results show that in general, transparency may be associated with lower inflation across a broad range of countries and frameworks. In addition, the output costs of disinflation, as measured by the sacrifice ratio, are negatively related to the degree of monetary policy transparency. The capacity of the central bank to limit the monetary financing of government deficits also has an inflation-reducing effect. Considering transparency as a possible determinant of cross-country differences in the costs of disinflation represents a new contribution to the literature, especially given the failure of previous empirical research to find a robust negative relationship between other aspects of the central bank's institutional design and the sacrifice ratio.

T2  - Repositorio Digital Banco Central
AB  - Inflation targeting cum exchange-rate floating has become the framework of choice in countries pursuing an independent and effective monetary policy. Since its adoption by New Zealand (1990) and Chile (1991), central banks of nearly 25 industrial and emerging economies have implemented an explicit inflation target as their nominal anchor. Many more emerging economies are planning to adopt inflation targeting in coming years. The theory and practice of monetary policy under inflation targeting have evolved hand-in­-hand, benefiting mutually. This volume presents 14 papers that add substantially to the body of theoretical findings, empirical research, and policy lessons on the conduct of monetary policy under inflation targeting. New theoretical work focuses on the optimality of inflation targeting under different fiscal policies and varying degrees of price stickiness, and considering the zero-bound problem. Other analytical research addresses improvements in central bank communication required to raise monetary policy efficiency and analyzes the optimal degree of monetary policy transparency and communication. New findings are provided on the choice between inflation and price-level targeting. This book also presents a large body of new empirical evidence on the role of the exchange rate, pre-conditions at the start of the regime, gains in macro performance and monetary policy efficiency, and anchoring of inflation expectations in inflation-targeting countries, in comparison to non-targeting countries. The transition from partial to full-fledged inflation targeting in Chile receives particular attention, reporting changes in monetary policy rules and in inflation determinants and dynamics.

AB  - We study how different forms of communication influence inflation expectations in a randomized controlled trial using nearly 20,000 US individuals. We elicit individuals’ inflation expectations and then provide eight different forms of information regarding inflation. Reading the actual Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) statement has about the same average effect on expectations as simply being told about the Federal Reserve’s inflation target. Reading news articles about the most recent FOMC meetings results in a forecast revision that is smaller by half. This exogenous variation in inflation expectations has subsequent effects on household spending reported in scanner and survey data.

T2  - Economic Modelling
AB  - This paper investigates the time-varying effects of monetary policy on aggregate, sectoral, and disaggregate inflation in India from 1997 to 2017 using a large dataset of 439 variables. We find that the effectiveness of a contractionary monetary policy in controlling aggregate inflation has improved over time. This improvement in the policy's effectiveness can be attributed to better transmission through credit and asset price channels. In investigating disaggregate inflation, we find that a contractionary monetary policy is more effective in reducing inflation in the manufacturing sector than in the agricultural sector. Further, the sacrifice ratios in all manufacturing sectors have improved over time. However, the commodities prices of some sectors respond positively after a monetary contraction, which demonstrates the presence of a cost channel in the Indian economy. Our findings suggest that the monetary authority in India should have an interest rate rule that incorporates sectoral inflation and reacts to each with different intensity.

TI  - The effects of globalization on inflation and their implications for monetary policy
AU  - Kohn, Donald L.
T2  - Conference Series ; [Proceedings]
AB  - Policymakers here and abroad cannot lose sight of a fundamental truth: In a world of separate currencies that can fluctuate against each other over time, each country?s central bank determines its inflation rate. If the FOMC were to allow the U.S. economy to run beyond its sustainable potential for some time, inflation would eventually rise. And, this pickup would become self-perpetuating if it became embedded in inflation expectations. Thus, while a better understanding of the implications of globalization will aid in our understanding of inflation dynamics, it is also clear that such developments do not relieve central banks of their responsibility for maintaining price and economic stability.

AB  - Several countries are concurrently experiencing historically low inflation rates and ageing populations. Is there a connection, as recently suggested by some senior central bankers? We undertake a comprehensive test of this hypothesis in a panel of 22 countries over the 1955-2010 period. We find a stable and significant correlation between demography and low-frequency inflation. In particular, a larger share of dependents (ie young and old) is correlated with higher inflation, while a larger share of working age cohorts is correlated with lower inflation. The results are robust to different country samples, time periods, control variables and estimation techniques. We also find a significant, albeit unstable, relationship between demography and monetary policy.

AB  - The relationship between inflation and inflation uncertainty is investigated in six European Union countries for the period 1960–99. Exponential generalized autoregressive conditional heteroscedasticity models are used to generate a measure of inflation uncertainty and then Granger methods are employed to test for causality between average inflation and inflation uncertainty. In all the European countries except Germany, inflation significantly raises inflation uncertainty as predicted by Friedman. However, in all countries except the UK, inflation uncertainty does not cause negative output effects, implying that a common European monetary policy applied by the European Central Bank might lead to asymmetric real effects via the inflation uncertainty channel. Less robust evidence is found regarding the direction of the impact of a change in inflation uncertainty on inflation. In Germany and the Netherlands, increased inflation uncertainty lowers inflation, while in Italy, Spain and, to a lesser extent, France increased inflation uncertainty raises inflation. These results are generally consistent with the existing rankings of central bank independence.

TI  - The Effect of Monetary Policy on Inflation in Kenya
AU  - Koila, Lialo J.
AB  - Over the years central Bank of Kenya (CBK) has utilized monetary policies to bring about stabilization on inflation and output by use of reserve money simultaneously and Central bank rates (CBR). It is however very important that a central bank should respond to the problem of monetary policy transmission mechanism. With respect to monetary policy shocks a monetary authority or central banks needs to know the elasticity of price rises in order to decide the amount by which value of the policy instrument should change so as to get hold of a preferred amount of change in inflation. The monetary authority should also be familiar with the standard amount of time taken for the full impact of a monetary policy shock on inflation to become visible. In cooperation with information of the suppleness, this it possible for the central bank to take timely measured policy actions aimed at managing inflation.
The objective of this project was to establish the effects of monetary policies on inflation in the economy. To achieve this objective, a descriptive research design that covers a time series of five (5) years was adopted. The population of interest in this study consisted of monetary policy aggregates used by central bank over the study period. The study used secondary data obtained from the KNBS for the years 2009-2013.The variables of interest i.e. inflation rates, reserve ratios, CBR rates were entered into statistical package for social sciences and analyzed to examine their relationship and hence achieve the research objective.
It was noted that there is a relationship between monetary policies and inflation. Evidence from the statistics showed that the coefficients of central bank rate are positive while that of reserve ratio is negative. This implies that there is a negative relationship between inflation rate and reserve ratio requirement while that of central bank rate is positive. The relationship can be used to formulate a targeted policy towards attaining acceptable level of inflation set at 5% in Kenya.
The study recommends that in order for the country to realize a stable rate of inflation the central bank should focus on Reserve ratio requirement and develop best practices towards its full implementation. However the use of multiple monetary policy tools is therefore necessary so as to eliminate the bias related to period under consideration.

TI  - Inflation Expectations and the Transmission of Monetary Policy
AU  - Roberts, John M.
AB  - New Keynesian models with sticky prices and rational expectations have a difficult time explaining why reducing inflation usually requires a recession. An explanation for the costliness of reducing inflation is that inflation expectations are less than perfectly rational. To explore this possibility, I estimate the degree of non-rationality implicit in two survey measures of inflation expectations. I find that the surveys reflect an intermediate degree of rationality: Expectations are neither perfectly rational nor as unsophisticated as simple autoregressive models would suggest. I also find that a structural New Keynesian model with expectations formation based on the survey results is able to match closely the empirical costs of reducing inflation.

T2  - Journal of Development and Capital
AB  - Objective: The relationship between monetary policy shocks and total deposits of banks are one of the main important issues in monetary economics and banking literatures and has been considered empirically in recent years. Hence, the main aim of this paper is to evaluate the relationship among these variables by applying dynamic panel data approach for 23 private and governmental banks during the 2008-2019. Method: For achieving this purpose, at first the inflationary environments have been extracted by Markov- Switching and then, by utilizing dynamic panel data and GMM estimator the short-run relationship between variables have been tested. Results: The empirical findings of this paper indicated that the first order lag of bank deposits has a positive and significant effect on the volume of deposits in current year and its amount is equal to 0.17. Also, the variable of the interaction of liquidity growth rate with severe inflation environments and banks 'legal reserve ratio has a negative and significant effect on private banks' deposit volume and the variables of long-term deposit interest rate, real GDP growth rate and liquidity quality have a positive and significant effect on deposit volume. State-owned banks are positive and meaningful, consistent with theoretical expectations. The deposit profit rate has positive and other monetary policy variables such as liquidity growth rate and rule of deposits ratio and cross effect of liquidity money growth with inflationary environment have negative impact on the total deposits of Banks. Regarding the negative and significant effect of the interaction of liquidity growth rate with high inflation environments, it can be argued that with increasing liquidity and increasing demand, the general level of prices increases and consequently inflation rate increases and the economy enters a severe inflation environment, so expect as inflation intensifies, demand for deposits in banks will decrease and the incentive to invest in alternative environments such as the foreign exchange market, gold and other assets will increase. In addition, the value of Sargan test statistics indicates that the null hypothesis is not rejected and the instrumental variables defined in the model are valid. Because the value of this test statistic shows that the instrument variables defined are not correlated with the error terms. It is worth noting that in this estimate, due to the shorter period of time under study, the second-order interval of the volume of deposits of private and state-owned banks is considered as an instrument variable. According to the results of Arellano & Bond, it can be inferenced that the order of self-correlation between the disorder sentences was of the first order. Therefore, this method is a best method to eliminate the fixed effects of the model. Conclusion: Considering the negative and significant effect of the interaction of liquidity growth rate with inflationary environments on the deposit volume of the banking sector, it is suggested that economic policymakers apply contractionary monetary policies to control and decrease the volume of liquidity and control the general level of prices and inflation. Provide calm and gentle inflationary environments as well as increase the investment of individuals and legal entities with banks and help increase their deposits.

TI  - MONETARY POLICY AND INFLATION CONTROL: THE CASE OF NIGERIA | Ezeanyeji | European Journal of Management and Marketing Studies
AB  - Inflation is a major problem facing Nigeria as a country today. The Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), however, has made efforts to fight it using different policy measures, of which monetary policy is one of them. Thus, this study focuses on the impact of monetary policy on inflation control in Nigeria. The study is based on time series data from 1980 to 2019. The Augmented Dickey Fuller test, Johansen’s co-integration test, the Error Correction model (ECM) estimation was employed in the analysis. The variables include – exchange rate, inflation rate, money supply (% GDP), Treasury bill rate and monetary policy rate. The research findings showed that monetary policy has no significant impact on inflation control in Nigeria both in the short – run and long – run. Money supply has negative and insignificant impact on inflation control in Nigeria both in the short – run and long – run. Again, exchange rate has negative and insignificant effect on inflation control in Nigeria both in the short – run and long – run. The Treasury bill rate has negative but significant effect on inflation control in Nigeria in the short – run, while in the long – run it has positive but insignificant effect on inflation control in Nigeria. The study, therefore, recommends that, Government should provide monetary policies that will preferred efficient provider of favourable environment in terms of the implementation of the appropriate monetary policy rate, exchange rate etc in order to attract both domestic and foreign investment which will create employment opportunities for the Nigerian populace and in turn lead to the expansion of the industries in the country

AB  - With the end of intermediate exchange rate regimes, countries are either abandoning domestic monetary policy (by choosing super-hard pegs or relinquishing their national currencies altogether) or strengthening independent monetary policymaking (by adopting floating exchange rates, of either the clean or dirty variety) (Fischer, 2001, Calvo and Mishkin, 2003). Among monetary regimes, inflation targeting has become the natural complement of flexible exchange rate regimes. Many countries—which differ in size, structural features, and development level—have selected inflation- targeting-cum-floating as their preferred framework for pursuing a more independent and effective monetary policy. This choice is often made by instrument-independent central banks in open economies with a history of inflation, which need to establish a credible monetary anchor to promote price stability (Mishkin and Schmidt-Hebbel, 2002).

AB  - Monetary policy has been over-relied upon in the recent past to deliver on output and price stability. The era of austerity saw the rise of monetary policy dominance, and though this has waned a bit since both the financial crisis and COVID-19, the general framework upon which the monetary policy apparatus is built remains the same. In this chapter, I deconstruct this model in fie arguments, and propose an alternative theory of the transmission of monetary policy, through income distribution.

AB  - This paper addresses a number of questions which are essential to a proper understanding of the causes and effects of the inflationary process and to an assessment of the contribution of monetary policy to the achievement of long-term price stability. These questions are: (1) what are the economic costs of inflation? (2) what part does monetary policy play in the short- and medium-term evolution of inflation? (3) what are the most appropriate monetary policy strategies for fighting inflation?

AB  - The literature on transparency and central bank communication and the literature on disagreement about expectations are evolving; however, both have been evolving separately. Despite the advances in the literature, several key issues remain open and there are gaps to be filled. Therefore, this study analyses the effects of monetary policy signalling and clarity of central bank communication on disagreement about inflation expectations. It also investigates whether greater transparency coincides with lower levels of disagreement in inflation expectations in Brazil. The findings suggest that transparency is important to reduce disagreement about inflation expectations. Moreover, our estimates indicate that central bank communication and clarity affect disagreement about inflation expectations in Brazil.

I shall begin by reviewing some of the respects in which inflation targeting as currently implemented represents a step toward what the theory of optimal monetary policy would recommend. In the final section of the paper, I then summarize some of the more important respects in which an optimal policy regime would go beyond current practice. Finally, as a concrete illustration of some of the general remarks that have been made about the form of an optimal policy rule, in an appendix I briefly discuss the quantitative character of optimal policy in the context of the small econometric model for the United States presented in Giannoni and Woodford (forthcoming).'

AB  - Using laboratory experiments within a New Keynesian framework, we explore the interaction between the formation of inflation expectations and monetary policy design. The central question in this paper is how to design monetary policy when expectations formation is not perfectly rational. Instrumental rules that use actual rather than forecasted inflation produce lower inflation variability and reduce expectational cycles. A forward-looking Taylor rule where a reaction coefficient equals 4 produces lower inflation variability than rules with reaction coefficients of 1.5 and 1.35. Inflation variability produced with the latter two rules is not significantly different. Moreover, the forecasting rules chosen by subjects appear to vary systematically with the policy regime, with destabilizing mechanisms chosen more often when inflation control is weaker.

AU  - Schwartz, Anna J.
T2  - Atlantic Economic Journal
AB  - It is crucial that central banks and regulatory authorities be aware of effects of asset price inflation on the stability of the financial system. Lending activity based on asset collateral during the boom is hazardous to the health of lenders when the boom collapses. One way that authorities can curb the distortion of lenders' portfolios during asset price booms is to have in place capital requirements that increase with the growth of credit extensions collateralized by assets whose prices have escalated. If financial institutions avoid this pitfall, their soundness will not be impaired when assets backing loans fall in value. Rather than trying to gauge the effects of asset prices on core inflation, central banks may be better advised to be alert to the weakening of financial balance sheets in the aftermath of a fall in value of asset collateral backing loans.

Moreover, the paper provides empirical evidence that the gain of credibility is crucial to reduce the volatility of the basic interest as well as the inflation rate in Brazil. The findings suggest credibility plays a key role for the conduct of monetary policy and inflation control.

T3  - Financial System Reform and Monetary Policies in Asia
AB  - A critical issue involved with the transmission of monetary policy is the degree and speed at which changes in the official policy rate are transmitted to other rates faced by firms and households. The paper explores changing financial environment in Thailand after inflation targeting has adopted. Furthermore, the empirical analyses are provided to investigate the long-run relationship and the degree of pass-through between the policy rate and the various financial market interest rates in Thailand. It is found that there exist co-movements between 14-day repurchase rate and the financial market rates in the long-run, except for the finance company lending rate. The paper also shows that the transmission of monetary policy through the interest rate channel has become weak. Nonetheless, the credit channel through the commercial bank lending is still a valid monetary transmission mechanism of Thailand. It is worth noting that there is a decrease in the degree of disintermediation as well as an increase in the roles of other sources of fund.

Using a novel approach that does not assume unbiasedness of expectations, which makes use of survey data on expected future as well as perceived past price developments and allows for nonnormal peakedness and asymmetry, we convert qualitative survey responses of consumers in various European countries into quantitative time series of inflation expectations. After checking the rationality of the constructed expectations measures, we investigate the effects of unanticipated movements in interest rates and inflation on inflation expectations across European countries. We inter alia seek to explore whether the reaction of consumers in countries with more credible central banks differs from the reaction of consumers in less credible countries.

AB  - Low inflation likely reflects factors whose influence should fade over time. But many uncertainties attend this assessment, and downward pressures on inflation could prove to be unexpectedly persistent. My colleagues and I may have misjudged the strength of the labor market, the degree to which longer-run inflation expectations are consistent with our inflation objective, or even the fundamental forces driving inflation. In interpreting incoming data, we will need to stay alert to these possibilities and, in light of incoming information, adjust our views about inflation, the overall economy, and the stance of monetary policy best suited to promoting maximum employment and price stability. How should policy be formulated in the face of such significant uncertainties? In my view, it strengthens the case for a gradual pace of adjustment. But we should also be wary of moving too gradually. It would be imprudent to keep monetary policy on hold until inflation is back to 2%.

AB  - The authors constructed a time series of monthly inflation uncertainty in Turkey from 1960 to 1998 using GARCH models and investigated the link between inflation and inflation uncertainty using Granger tests. The authors found strong statistical support that inflation significantly raised inflation uncertainty in Turkey over the full sample period and three subsamples. The evidence on the effect of inflation uncertainty on average inflation is mixed and depends on the time period examined. An analysis of the political conditions and the record of macroeconomic policy making in Turkey between 1960 and 1998 reveal institutional and political factors that can help explain the empirical results.

AB  - Edited and with an introduction by Benjamin M. Friedman The connection between price inflation and real economic activity has been a focus of macroeconomic research--and debate--for much of the past century. Although this connection is crucial to our understanding of what monetary policy can and cannot accomplish, opinions about its basic properties have swung widely over the years. Today, virtually everyone studying monetary policy acknowledges that, contrary to what many modern macroeconomic models suggest, central bank actions often affect both inflation and measures of real economic activity, such as output, unemployment, and incomes. But the nature and magnitude of these effects are not yet understood. In this volume, Robert M. Solow and John B. Taylor present their views on the dilemmas facing U.S. monetary policymakers. The discussants are Benjamin M. Friedman, James K. Galbraith, N. Gregory Mankiw, and William Poole. The aim of this lively exchange of views is to make both an intellectual contribution to macroeconmics and a practical contribution to the solution of a public policy question of central importance.

TI  - Inflation targeting in high inflation emerging economies: lessons about rules and instruments
AU  - Taylor, John B.
T2  - Journal of Applied Economics
AB  - This talk emphasizes the connection between inflation targeting and monetary policy rules. Inflation targeting is not enough. You need to have a policy procedure – a policy rule – to achieve the target. And one cannot design or evaluate a monetary policy rule without a target inflation rate. Hence, there is a symbiotic relationship between inflation targeting and monetary policy rules. Initially, the instrument in the policy rule was a monetary aggregate – a quantity, usually the money supply. It was only later that research on monetary policy rules focused on another instrument of monetary policy – the interest rate, as velocity became more volatile so the interest rate was more reliable as instrument, at least for low levels of inflation. Interest rate rules work best within a band between very high inflation and deflation. Outside that band, the central bank should rely more on money growth rules.

AB  - This paper investigates the long run and short run relationships of monetary policy, inflation and economic growth in Pakistan using co-integration and causality analysis during the period 0f 1972-2010. A large number of empirical studies on the relationships of monetary policy and inflation are available and most of these have analyzed the effectiveness of monetary policy in controlling inflation in Pakistan. The present study fills the gap in the literature by analyzing the nexus of monetary policy, inflation and growth in Pakistan. The results indicate that credit to private sector, the variable of financial depth, real exchange rate and budget deficit are found elastic and significant variables to influence the real GDP in Pakistan. The pair-wise Granger Causality results suggest that real GDP and real exchange rate are causing to each other bi-directionally. The real GDP also do cause financial depth (M2GD), domestic credit (CREDIT) and budget deficit (BDEF) uni-directionally. The real exchange rate is also causing the financial depth and budget deficit variables. The results are consistent with the empirical literature.

AU  - Sims, Christopher A.
AB  - Monetary economics as practiced by central bank modelers has made a great deal of progress in recent years. In a 2002 paper I interviewed research economists at four central banks and surveyed the models in use at those banks. I criticized the models for having lost all touch with statistical inference and with its connection to decision theory. I also criticized them for not following the rational expectations literature by jointly specifying and estimating the equations in their systems. And I pointed out that none of the models had a consistent treatment of asset markets. Since then many central banks, taking advantage of the new computational methods for Bayesian inference that economists are learning to use, have made substantial progress toward meeting the first two of these criticisms. They have still for the most part done little about the third. And academic economists are beginning to question some of the standard assumptions in the rational expectations framework that underlies these models. Recent events in financial markets, and the difficulties that they raise for central banks, make it painfully clear that even the frontier Bayesian DSGE models like that in use at the Swedish Riksbank do not model asset markets in any depth. But the problem goes beyond that: these models, and most academic macro models as well, assume a standard rational expectations framework: there is only one probability measure in play, the 'true' probability measure from which nature draws realizations. Agents in the model form expectations using this true distribution, conditioning on information sets that consist of all information in the model dated t and earlier. It is well documented that people do not actually behave this way, and in the literature on behavioral finance there is some suggestion that deviations from this standardized assumption of rational behavior given a common probability distribution may be important. The recent events in financial markets - the dotcom boom, the US house price boom, perhaps the continuing commodity price boom - look to some observers like bubbles that must have fed off some sort of irrational behavior. Many observers think that monetary policy might have somehow fueled these bubble-like episodes in asset markets. These are important questions for monetary policy, and it is disturbing that the monetary policy models in use cannot even be used to pose these questions. In this paper I focus on two particular, and related, deviations from the assumption that all agents have the same probability distribution and that they optimally process all information available up to some date t. I consider the implications of agents' being able to process information only at a limited rate, and the implications of agents' assuming differing probability distriubions. This is part of a series of BIS Working Papers (273 to 278) collecting papers presented at the BIS's Seventh Annual Conference on 'Whither monetary policy? Monetary policy challenges in the decade ahead' in Luzern, Switzerland, on 26-27 June 2008. The event brought together senior representatives of central banks and academic institutions to exchange views on this topic.  BIS Paper 45 contains the opening address of William R White (BIS), the contributions of the policy panel on 'Beyond price stability - the challenges ahead' and speeches by Edmund Phelps (Columbia University) and Martin Wolf (Financial Times). The participants in the policy panel discussion chaired by Malcolm D Knight (BIS) were Martin Feldstein (Harvard University), Stanley Fischer (Bank of Israel), Mark Carney (Bank of Canada) and Jean-Pierre Landau (Banque de France). This Working Paper includes comments by Athanasios Orphanides and Lars E O Svensson.

AU  - Altavilla, Carlo

T2  - Economic Modelling
AB  - This paper explores the role that inflation forecasts play in the uncertainty surrounding the estimated effects of alternative monetary rules on unemployment dynamics in the euro area and the US. We use the inflation forecasts of 8 competing models in a standard Bayesian VAR to analyse the size and the timing of these effects, as well as to quantify the uncertainty relative to the different inflation models under two rules. The results suggest that model uncertainty can be a serious issue and strengthen the case for a policy strategy that takes into account several sources of information. We find that combining inflation forecasts from many models not only yields more accurate forecasts than those of any specific model, but also reduces the uncertainty associated with the real effects of policy decisions. These results are in line with the model-combination approach that central banks already follow when conceiving their strategy.

Our findings provide evidence that some households form their expectations in a way that is consistent with a Taylor (1993)-type rule. We also document a large degree of variation in the pattern of responses over the business cycle. In particular, the negative relationship between unemployment and interest rates that is apparent in the data only shows up in households׳ answers during periods of labor market weakness.

TI  - One size fits none? Common monetary policy and inflation differentials in EMU
AU  - Geiger, Felix
AU  - Spahn, Peter
AB  - 1. Nominal divergence: violation of the 'law of one price'? Nominal divergence is the deviation of absolute, i.e. money prices, from average values, which emerge on homogenous markets. On the one hand, such deviations may be interpreted as violations of the 'law of one price', signalling market failure or imperfections. Either agents are to blame for a lack of rationality, or arbitrage is limited because of institutional re-strictions. On the other hand, it has to be examined whether the market is homogenous in the first place. If not, persistent price differences reveal a market separation, and nominal divergence turns out to be a relative price. Nominal divergence may appear on labour, goods and asset markets, i.e. on markets where flows or stocks are traded. Financial integration in EMU has made great strides; we observe interest rate conformity even of those assets that cannot safely be regarded as homogenous assets, namely public debt paper issued by different national agencies. Real estate prices, however, show large divergence across Europe. There are several possible explanations: − In a process of general asset price inflation (which is currently ob-served as a mirror image of euro M3 growth) agents are searching for real estate objects in order to improve their portfolio allocation. Be-cause of lagging price developments and expected locational quasi-rents in some countries, market equilibrium is not yet achieved. − Structural change, which is a by-product of the catching-up process, 1 The title is, partly, borrowed from Enderlein (2005), and a critical echo to the af-firmative 'one size fits all' belief propagated by Issing (2001).

AB  - The literature has long agreed that the DMP model (after Diamond 1982, Mortensen 1982, Pissarides 1985) with search and matching frictions in the labor market can deliver large volatilities in labor market quantities, consistent with empirical data, only if there is at least some wage stickiness. I show, however, that the model can deliver nontrivial volatilities without wage stickiness, as long as it has price dispersion and nonzero long-run inflation rates. I find that by keeping inflation at a positive rate, monetary policy may be accountable for the large standard deviations observed on labor market variables. In addition, the Shimer (2005) puzzle disappears under monetary policy shocks.

AU  - Sims, Christopher A.
T2  - European Economic Review
T3  - Special Issue on Monetary and Fiscal Interactions in Times of Economic Stress
AB  - The inflation of the 1970s in the US is often discussed as if the only type of policy action that could have prevented the inflation were monetary policy actions and the only type of policy errors that might have induced the inflation were monetary policy errors. Yet fiscal policy underwent dramatic shifts in the 1970s and economic theory makes clear that in an environment of uncertainty about future fiscal policy, monetary policy instruments may lose potency or have perverse effects. This paper documents the vagaries of fiscal policy in this period and argues that people at the time must have been uncertain about fiscal policy's future course. It also lays out a theoretical framework for understanding the effects of fiscal uncertainties on monetary policy and shows that fiscal variables have predictive value in dynamic models, even if traditional monetary policy indicators are included in the system.

AU  - Libânio, Gilberto
T2  - Brazilian Journal of Political Economy
AB  - This paper analyzes the relation between monetary policy and economic performance in Brazil during the period 1999-2006. In particular, it discusses the growth effects of the inflation targeting regime through its effects on aggregate demand. It is argued that monetary policy under IT reacts in a procyclical and asymmetric way to fluctuations in economic activity (too "tight" during recessions, not so "loose" during expansions). Such pattern may generate a downward bias in aggregate demand, with negative real effects on output growth and employment. Our results suggest that monetary policy has been procyclical and asymmetrical in Brazil under inflation targeting. The main economic policy implication of this study is that central banks should consider more seriously the real effects of monetary policy on output and employment.

TI  - Monetary policy, trend inflation and inflation Persistence
AU  - Yao, Fang
AB  - This paper presents a new mechanism through which monetary policy rules affect inflation persistence. When assuming that price reset hazard functions are not constant, backward-looking dynamics emerge in the NKPC. This new mechanism makes the traditional demand channel of monetary transmission have a long-lasting effect on inflation dynamics. The Calvo model fails to convey this insight, because its constant hazard function leads those important backward-looking dynamics to be canceled out. I first analytically show how it works in a simple setup, and then solve a log-linearized model numerically around positive trend inflation. With realistic calibration of trend inflation and the monetary policy rule, the model can account for the pattern of changes in inflation persistence observed in the post-wwii U.S. data. In addition, with increasing hazard functions, the 'Taylor principle' is sufficient to guarantee the determinate equilibrium even under extremely high trend inflation.

AU  - Posen, Adam S.
AB  - How should governments and central banks use monetary policy to create a healthy economy? Traditionally, policymakers have used such strategies as controlling the growth of the money supply or pegging the exchange rate to a stable currency. In recent years a promising new approach has emerged: publicly announcing and pursuing specific targets for the rate of inflation. This book is the first in-depth study of inflation targeting. Combining penetrating theoretical analysis with detailed empirical studies of countries where inflation targeting has been adopted, the authors show that the strategy has clear advantages over traditional policies. They argue that the U.S. Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank should adopt this strategy, and they make specific proposals for doing so. The book begins by explaining the unique features and advantages of inflation targeting. The authors argue that the simplicity and openness of inflation targeting make it far easier for the public to understand the intent and effects of monetary policy. This strategy also increases policymakers' accountability for inflation performance and can accommodate flexible, even "discretionary," monetary policy actions without sacrificing central banks' credibility. The authors examine how well variants of this approach have worked in nine countries: Germany and Switzerland (which employ a money-focused form of inflation targeting), New Zealand, Canada, the United Kingdom, Sweden, Israel, Spain, and Australia. They show that these countries have typically seen lower inflation, lower inflation expectations, and lower nominal interest rates, and have found that one-time shocks to the price level have less of a "pass-through" effect on inflation. These effects, in turn, are improving the climate for economic growth. The authors warn, however, that the success of inflation targeting depends on operational details, such as how the targets are defined and when they are announced. They also show that inflation targeting is not a panacea that can make inflation perfectly predictable or reduce it without economic costs. Clear, balanced, and authoritative, Inflation Targeting is a groundbreaking study that will have a major impact on the debate over the right monetary strategy for the coming decades. As a unique comparative study of what central banks actually do in different countries around the world, this book will also be invaluable to anyone interested in how economic policy is made.

AU  - Bicchal, Motilal
AB  - This paper provides a Vector Auto-Regression (VAR) analysis of inflation and monetary policy. It identifies monetary policy shocks in a benchmark recursive structure of VARs with two alternative inflation measures, viz., headline WPI and core inflation measure. Unlike the results in case of WPI, the response of core prices declined swiftly, following a positive call money interest rate shock. Thus, the interest rate channel is stronger for core prices. It is pertinent as RBI currently operates its monetary management through interest rate channel. The study checks robustness of results of the benchmark recursive model against alternative ordering and non-recursive identification schemes. Finally, a core price targeting scenario is generated in the benchmark VAR model with non-recursive identification scheme.

AB  - This paper analyzes the determinants of the inflation risk premium in Brazil during the Inflation Targeting period. In particular, different from the existing studies, we analyze the influence of both public debt expectations and disagreement in expectations about public debt on the inflation risk premium, and also the effect of monetary policy credibility on the inflation risk premium. The findings bring two important policy implications. One related to the effect of the expectations formed for the commitment of the government with debt management; and the other related to the effect of the expectations formed for the central bank’s commitment with the Inflation Targeting regime. The results suggest the disagreement in expectations about the public debt affects the inflation risk premium. Furthermore, the findings also suggest the degree of anchorage of inflation expectations in relation to the inflation target (i.e., the monetary policy credibility) affects the inflation risk premium.

AB  - This paper is assessing various leading indicators of inflation in Finland and their practical role in a framework for Finnish monetary policy under a floating exchange rate. Following Friedman (1990) who argued for the explicit inclusion of a broad set of economic indicators in the monetary decision process, absent a practical intermediate target, this paper tests a large number of indicators for their relevance in determining future inflationary pressure and guiding monetary policy. The robustness of the indicators is examined under different models, guided by alternative views of the monetary transmission process. The results indicate that a monetary conditions index, stumpage prices, and real and nominal effective exchange rates are among the strongest indicators, affecting inflation with a lag of between 4 and 11 quarters.

This model is novel for South Africa in two ways: it is the first VECX* developed to analyse monetary policy and the first model that uses time-varying trade weights to create the foreign series. We impose three significant long-run relations (augmented purchasing power parity, uncovered interest parity and Fisher parity) to investigate the effect of a monetary policy shock on inflation. The results suggest the effective transmission of monetary policy.

AB  - The Japanese economy has recently been faced with massive nonperforming assets and a large output gap. Thanks to the historically unprecedented accommodative monetary policy of the Bank of Japan (BOJ), prices have generally been stable and severe deflation has been avoided. Despite this, the BOJ has been questioned and criticized regarding its conduct of monetary policy. For example, why doesn't it adopt inflation targeting? Why has the BOJ stubbornly refused to increase the outright purchase of long-term government bonds? Why does the BOJ implement fund absorption operations in the middle of monetary easing? This paper tries to evaluate questions and criticisms regarding the conduct of the BOJ's monetary policy under zero inflation by using the following two criteria: (1) the BOJ will take measures necessary to achieve the sound development of the national economy through the pursuit of price stability in the long run; however, (2) the BOJ will not take such measures if the side effects are deemed greater than the effects, which makes it difficult to achieve the objective in (1).

AU  - Westelius, Niklas J.
T2  - Journal of Monetary Economics
AB  - Rational expectations models of staggered price/wage contracts have failed to replicate the observed persistence in inflation and unemployment during disinflationary periods. The current literature on this persistency puzzle has focused on augmenting the nominal contract model with imperfect credibility and learning. In this paper, I re-examine the persistency puzzle by focusing on the discretionary nature of monetary policy. I show that when the central bank is allowed to re-optimize a quadratic loss function each period, imperfect credibility and learning, even in the absence of staggered contracts, can generate a significant amount of inflation persistence and employment losses during a disinflationary period.

AU  - Svensson, Lars E O
AB  - Michael Woodford’s paper “Inflation Targeting and Financial Stability” presents a case
for tighter monetary policy, “leaning against the wind,” in order to reduce the probability
of a financial crisis. However, the introduction of financial-stability instruments (macroprudential instruments) that have a more direct effect on leverage than the policy rate
allows monetary-policy and financial-stability policy to be conducted separately, with
monetary policy focusing on the traditional objective of stabilizing inflation and resource
allocation and financial-stability policy focusing on the objective of financial stability

TI  - Monetary Policy and the Stock Market: Theory and Empirical Evidence
AU  - Sellin, Peter
T2  - Journal of Economic Surveys
AB  - This paper gives a comprehensive review of the literature on the interaction between real stock returns, inflation, and money growth, with a special emphasis on the role of monetary policy. This is an area of research that has interested monetary and financial economists for a long time. Monetary economists have been interested in the question whether money has any effect on real stock prices, while financial economists have investigated whether equity is a good hedge against inflation. Empirical studies show that money can be helpful in predicting future stock returns. Empirical evidence also suggest that equity is not a good hedge against inflation in the short run but may be so in the long run. The short-run negative relation between stock returns and inflation can easily be explained by theoretical models. If the central bank conducts a countercyclical monetary policy this will result in a negative relation between inflation and stock returns, while if it conducts a procyclical policy we could observe a positive relation. According to both theoretical and empirical studies investors receive an inflation risk premium for holding equity.

AB  - This paper reviews the role of monetary policy in the disinflation process that has taken place in the Mexican economy in recent years. The purpose is to show that, once an economy establishes a sustainable fiscal position, an inflation targeting framework can be seen as an efficient mechanism to impose discipline on monetary policy and, thus, to reduce inflation. This paper describes the measures that were taken after the 1995 crisis to stabilize the economy and that prevented the possibility of a fiscal dominance situation from arising. Consequently, the role of monetary policy in reducing inflation is analyzed, in particular its response to different inflationary shocks. Results show that in conducting the successful disinflationary process, Banco de México’s responses to inflationary shocks have been consistent with inflation targeting principles.

AB  - This paper presents a simple framework for analysing the operation and effectiveness of monetary policy in open economies in the spirit of aggregative approaches that are the mainstay of intermediate macroeconomic theory. Combining standard macroeconomic relations with precepts from international finance, it provides new lessons for the conduct of monetary policy under inflation targeting. It first confirms the classic Mundell-Fleming result that monetary policy is only effective as a short run stabilization instrument under floating exchange rates, yet goes further in showing that countercyclical monetary policy is incompatible with inflation targeting under fixed exchange rates. Second, it highlights the importance of anchoring inflation expectations as a means of inflation control. Third, it suggests how central banks should react to changes in the monetary stance abroad. Lastly, it demonstrates how monetary policy should respond to productivity improvement at home under floating exchange rates.

TI  - EFFECT OF MONETARY POLICY ON INFLATION IN THE KENYAN ECONOMY
AU  - Said, Hawaa Faraj
AB  - The Central Bank of Kenya in its mandate to keep in check the economy through its monetary
policy guidelines uses various instruments to achieve this objective. Even though this study area
has been explored by various researchers it is evident that there very little content on the effect of
monetary policy on inflation. Because of the need to fill the knowledge gap this research study
will seek to explore on the effect of monetary policy on specific commercial banking rates such
as fixed deposit rates, foreign exchange rates, lending rates and local money market rates. This
research was anchored on monetary policy theory, Taylor’s theory, Keynesian theory and Credit
market theory of inflation. The research objective was to establish the effect of monetary policy
on inflation in the Kenyan economy. The researcher adopted a descriptive research design. A
questionnaire was used. This study used primary data for the specific variables bank reserves,
open market operations, credit rate and exchange rate. The data collected was coded, quantified
and analyzed quantitatively. Quantitative data was analyzed by the use of descriptive statistics
using SPSS version 20 and presented through percentages, means, standard deviations and
frequencies. The inputted data was then presented in the form of tables and graphs. Regression
analysis was used to analyze the relationship between the variables. A response rate of 75% was
obtained. The research established a significant relationship between the monetary policy and
inflation. The independent variables contributed to 27.4% of the variation of inflation. The study
concluded that monetary policy affects inflation. The study recommended more studies to be
conducted to ascertain the policies or factors that constitute the remaining 72.6%.

T2  - Journal of Economic Dynamics and Control
AB  - In this paper we solve for the optimal (Stackelberg) policy in a model of credibility and monetary policy developed by Cukierman and Meltzer (1986). Unlike the (Nash) solution provided by Cukierman and Meltzer, the dynamic optimization problem facing the monetary authority in this case is not of a linear quadratic form and certainty equivalence does not apply. The learning behavior of the private sector (regarding the policymaker's preferences) becomes intimately linked with the choice of the optimal policy and cannot be separated as in the certainty-equivalent case. Once the dual effect of the optimal Stackelberg policy is recognized, the monetary authority has an additional channel of influence to consider beyond that taken into account by suboptimal certainty-equivalent Nash policy rules. Unlike Nash behavior the Stackelberg solution implies no inflationary bias, while being still (weakly) time-consistent. This makes the Stackelberg solution credible with only stagewise precommitment of the policymaker. In the absence of such a precommitment, learning behavior of the private sector does not sufficiently inhibit the incentive of the monetary authority to cheat in this model despite the fact that this learning is explicitly recognized in the Stackelberg solution.

The degree of ambiguity we measure in Blue Chip survey data helps explain the dynamics of long-run inflation expectations and the inflation trend measured in the US data. Ambiguity also has implications for monetary policy. We show that it is optimal for policymakers to lean against the households’ pessimistic expectations, but also document the limits to the extent the adverse effects of ambiguity can be undone.

AB  - This paper examines several key issues concerning the implications for monetary policy of the achievement of low inflation in OECD countries during the 1990s. In particular, the analysis considers whether there have been improvements in monetary policy transmission mechanisms that lower inflation vulnerabilities, or make it easier to reduce inflation pressures when they arise; and the further benefits and costs likely to be involved in lowering inflation to zero, or in attempting to maintain a stable price level. The analysis supports three main observations. First, there have been significant changes, particularly in inflation expectations and in monetary policy frameworks, that should help in containing inflation and lowering the costs of doing so. However, except in the United States and the United Kingdom, there is little evidence yet of fundamental changes in wage and price behaviour underlying the flexibility of labour and product markets; although it is possible that this ...

We find that there is a strong connection between the trend inflation and monetary policy regimes. The results also suggest that the introduction of the inflation targeting policy and quantitative and qualitative easing in the beginning of 2013 successfully escaped from the deflationary regime, but were not enough to achieve the 2% inflation target. Finally, our results indicate the significance of exchange rates in explaining the recent fluctuations of inflation and the importance of oil and stock prices in maintaining the positive trend inflation regime.

AB  - Post-1990 Chinese monetary policy is modeled with an augmented McCallum-type rule that takes into account the People's Bank of China's emphasis on targeting the rate of money supply growth. People's Bank policy appears responsive to the gap between target and actual nominal GDP as well as to external pressures. Additional cointegration analysis yields estimates of the gap between estimated money demand and actual money supply that appear to track the inflationary trends evident over our sample period. Chinese inflation and monetary policy outcomes seem reasonably captured using a standard monetary approach without the need to appeal to China-specific “structural” factors.

TI  - Inflation, Capital Taxation, and Monetary Policy
AU  - Feldstein, Martin
AB  - This paper discusses the effects of the interaction between inflation and the taxation of capital income. The principal conclusions are: (1) Inflation substantially increases the total effective tax rate on the income from capital used in the nonfinancial corporate sector. The total effective tax rate has risen from less than 60 percent in the mid-1960's to more than 70 percent in the late 1970's. (2) The higher effective tax rate reduces the real net rate of return to those who provide investment capital. In the late 19701s, the real net rate of return averaged less than three percent. (3) The interact ion between inflation and existing tax rules contributed to the fall in the ratio of share prices to real pretax earnings, or, equivalently, to the rise in the real cost to the firm of equity capital. (4) By reducing the real net return to investors and by widening the gap between the firms' cost of funds and the maximum return that they can afford to pay, the interaction between tax rates and inflation has depressed the rate of net investment in business fixed capital. (5) The failure to consider correctly the effects of the fiscal structure has caused observers to underestimate the expansionary character of monetary policy in the past two decades. (6) The goal of increasing investment while maintaining price stability can be achieved with tight money, a high real interest rate, and tax incentives for investment. A high real net-of-tax interest rate could reduce residential investment and other forms of consumer spending while the tax incentives offset the monetary effect for investment in business capital.

Inflation and output uncertainty are modeled in a bivariate constant conditional correlation generalized autoregressive conditional heteroskedastic (AR(p)-cccGARCH(1,1)) specification. We include the exchange rate in the mean equations, and use the headline and core inflation rates and industrial production to generate inflation and output uncertainty series. These series are then used in Granger causality tests to make inferences about the effect of monetary policy-induced inflation uncertainty. Causality tests show a positive relation from inflation to inflation uncertainty. Additionally, increased inflation uncertainty decreases output. These results are consistent with real costs associated with moderate inflation. Finally, we find no evidence that monetary policy reduced these costs.

To this end, we augment the traditional bivariate relationship between the nominal effective exchange rate and inflation by accounting for monetary stability proxied by the inflation environment, monetary policy regime and central bank behavior. We show that both the level and volatility of inflation, as well as adopting an inflation target or the transparency of monetary policy decisions clearly reduce ERPT to consumer prices. However, uncertainty about domestic monetary policy seems less relevant in explaining the pass-through to the price of imports.

AU  - Özatay, Fatih

AB  - There is a widespread consensus among economists that the goal of monetary policy, above all else, should be price stability. This study, by analyzing the Turkish experience in the last 15 years, emphasizes the importance of coordination of fiscal and monetary policies in achieving this aim. It is shown that, despite the rapidly changing financial environment, there are stationary long-run money-income relationships. Moreover, the growth rates of various monetary aggregates have predictive power for future movements in the consumer price index. However, as the Turkish experience made clear, in an economy where there are persistent budget deficits, these properties are not sufficient to conduct a successful monetary policy. The sustainability of fiscal policy is analyzed and rejected. Next, in a medium-term perspective, the levels of sustainable budget deficits compatible with a declining inflation path are calculated by making use of a small macroeconometric model.

T2  - Journal of Central Banking Theory and Practice
AB  - AbstractMost emerging market central banks have adopted inflation targeting as their monetary policy system. The heart of inflation targeting system is inflation expectations. The success of a central bank in achieving targets depends on to the extent to which inflation expectations are formed by the announced targets. As the credibility of the central bank increases, its ability to affect the public expectation also increases. The public adjusts its inflation expectations based on announced inflation target only in case of that they believe that the central bank has the sufficiency to reach the inflation target. Credibility enables expectation to be formed in a forward-looking way by weakening its connection with the past. This study aims to contribute to the literature concerning the effects of credibility on monetary policy. For this purpose, using data of six emerging inflation targeting economies (Turkey, Brazil, the Czech Republic, Chile, Poland, and South Africa), the empirical tests were carried out in order to understand the effect of the credibility on the behaviour of inflation expectation in emerging economies. The findings denote that credibility is quite relevant to reduce inflation expectations and contributes to the strength of inflation targets being an anchor for inflation expectations.

AB  - After more than two decades of inflation targeting in the world, it is important to evaluate if the adoption of this regime in a relevant developing country contributed to the creation of a better environment for the process of entrepreneurs’ expectations formation. Brazil is part of an important group of developing countries and represents a potential laboratory experiment in which the effects of an adoption of inflation targeting after more than a decade can be evaluated. Not enough is known about the consequences of inflation targeting credibility on both monetary policy and monetary policy transmission channels in developing countries that adopted inflation targeting. Emphasizing the role of transparency and the credibility of monetary policy as a performance criterion that motivate any country wishing to adopt an inflation targeting regime, this study leads to the fact that these two basic principles toward which a inflation targeting regime cannot be achieved without respect for certain pre namely institutional and technical conditions.

AB  - Positive experience of inflation targeting in many countries influenced the decision to implement this framework in Ukraine. Authors consider the appropriateness of retaining inflation target under conditions of deteriorating currency market. Uncertainty of forecasts is aggravated by fragile impact of monetary policy on Ukrainian economy in conditions of growing nonlinearity of macro-economic processes. The authors suggest the possibility of using two channels of transmission mechanism, namely, exchange rate and interest rate, and recommend additional tools to specify targets of monetary policy for the National Bank of Ukraine.

AB  - The purpose of this paper is study the effect of monetary policy on asset prices. We study the properties of a monetary model in which a real asset is valued for its rate of return and for its liquidity. We show that money is essential if and only if real assets are scarce, in the precise sense that their supply is not sufficient to satisfy the demand for liquidity. Our model generates a clear connection between asset prices and monetary policy. When money grows at a higher rate, inflation is higher and the return on money decreases. In equilibrium, no arbitrage amounts to equating the real return of both objects. Therefore, the price of the asset increases in order to lower its real return. This negative relationship between inflation and asset returns is in the spirit of research in finance initiated in the early 1980s.

AB  - This paper focuses on internal and external factors which influence the inflation rate in developing countries. A monetary model of inflation rate, capable of incorporating both monetary and fiscal policies as well as other internal and external factors, was developed and tested on Iranian data. It was found that, over the long run, a higher exchange rate leads to a higher price and that the fiscal policy is very effective to fight inflation. The major factors affecting inflation in Iran, over the long run, are internal rather than external. However, over the short run, the sources of inflation are both external and internal.

AB  - Financial economists have long debated whether monetary policy is neutral. This article addresses this question by examining how stock return data respond to monetary policy shocks. Monetary policy is measured by innovations in the federal funds rate and nonborrowed reserves, by narrative indicators, and by an event study of Federal Reserve policy changes. In every case the evidence indicates that expansionary policy increases ex-post stock returns. Results from estimating a multi-factor model also indicate that exposure to monetary policy increases an asset's ex-ante return.

AU  - Van Doorslaer, Hielke

T2  - New Political Economy
AB  - In this article we examine the limited effectiveness of major advanced central banks’ expansionary measures – particularly quantitative easing (QE) – in raising inflation from a post-Keynesian growth model perspective that distinguishes the sectoral-allocative effects of these policies from their class-distributive effects. In terms of sectoral-allocative effects, we empirically link the weak recovery of aggregate demand to the lack of rebalancing of the debt-led growth and export-led growth models and highlight the role of QE in reproducing these growth models. In terms of class-distributive effects, we draw attention to the flattening of the Phillips curve in advanced capitalist economies and explain this flattening from a post-Keynesian conflict model of inflation, pointing to the weakening of labour’s bargaining power as well as to the role of central banks’ overly premature withdrawal of monetary stimulus in contributing to that weakening. Finally, our analysis points to the entrenchment of a self-defeating macroeconomic policy mix (consisting of combination of loose monetary policy and restrictive fiscal policy) in debt-led and export-led growth models, which will continue to thwart efforts of central banks to significantly raise inflation.

AB  - This paper investigates the role of long-term inflation expectations for the monetary transmission mechanism and the conduct of monetary policy in a structural VAR framework. In contrast to earlier studies, we find that U.S. long-term inflation expectations respond significantly to a monetary policy shock. In line with a re-anchoring channel of monetary policy, long-term inflation expectations play an important role for the transmission of monetary policy shocks to the rate of inflation. Structural scenario analysis suggests that the response of monetary policy to expectations shocks contributes to the stabilization of inflation and unemployment.

TI  - ECB Forum on Central Banking, May 2014
AB  - In the context of a certain disconnect between economic performance and inflation the monetary policy
response has to be carefully considered and precisely designed. We are not resigned to allowing inflation
to remain too low for too long. But to understand “what is too low for too long”, we need to answer two
questions.
First, why is inflation so low?
Second, once we have a decomposition of inflation, we can ask: how likely is it that it persists over the
medium-term? Falling commodity prices have accounted for around 80% of the decline in euro area
inflation since late 2011. But there are two factors specific to the euro area that contribute to low inflation:
the rise in the euro exchange rate and the process of relative price adjustments in certain euro area
countries.
At present, our expectation is that low inflation will be prolonged but gradually return to 2%. Our
responsibility is nonetheless to be alert to the risks to this scenario that might emerge and prepared for
action if they do. What we need to be particularly watchful for at the moment is the potential for a
negative spiral to take hold between between low inflation, falling inflation expectations and credit, in
particular in stressed countries.
There is a risk that disinflationary expectations take hold. This may then cause households and firms to
defer expenditure in a classic deflationary cycle – especially when monetary policy is at the effective lower
bound and so cannot steer the nominal rate down to compensate.
On aggregate, euro area firms and households do not seem to be particularly exposed to debt deflation
dynamics. But this picture masks the heterogeneity within the euro area. Debt service-to-income ratios
tend to be higher in stressed countries. Credit weakness appears to be contributing to economic weakness
in these countries. Our analysis suggests that credit constraints are putting a brake on the recovery in
stressed countries, which adds to the disinflationary pressures. And heterogeneity becomes a factor in
assessing low inflation in the euro area.
In terms of the monetary policy response, the key issue is timing. We have to be mindful of mismatches
between the various trends: the rise in demand for credit; the repair of bank balance sheets; and the
development of capital markets as a complement to bank lending. At this point of the cycle, these
considerations feature prominently in the discussions of the Governing Council members. There is no
debate about our goal, which is to return inflation towards 2% in the medium-term, in line with our
mandate.

AB  - We investigate for spillovers from monetary policy uncertainty in the United States to the policy rates of seven inflation targeting emerging economies — Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Indonesia, Mexico, Poland, and South Africa. We use monthly data, with the start of the sample period being dictated by the start of the inflation targeting regime, and a multivariate GARCH-in-Mean vector autoregression (VAR), controlling for the traditional Taylor rule type variables. We also use a multivariate structural VAR and a different measure of U.S. monetary policy uncertainty, achieving identification by a combination of short-run and long-run restrictions. Our evidence shows that U.S. monetary policy uncertainty, irrespective of how it is measured, has negative effects on the macroeconomic and financial fundamentals of emerging economies.

TI  - Distributional Consequences of Monetary Policy in Emerging Economies: Dollarization, Domestic Inflation, and Income Divergence
AU  - Ybrayev, Zhandos
T2  - Comparative Economic Studies
AB  - This paper explores the distributional effects of monetary policy in the context of a small open economy. Emerging markets are structurally different from developed economies. They are generally associated with greater financial frictions, underdeveloped financial markets, as well as both a high average level of dollarized assets and unequal access to them, among others. Thus, distributional effects of monetary policy in emerging economies require additional specifications. In particular, I show that wealthy households (represented by the top 10% of the income distribution), who are more able to save in foreign currencies, gain in purchasing power of their incomes by hedging against domestic inflation. At the same time, the poor households (represented by the bottom fifty percent of the income distribution) retain a larger share of liquid assets denominated in domestic currency, thus experiencing a greater burden of local currency inflation. I also show that contractionary monetary policy is associated with periods of higher income inequality in emerging markets that is likely to exacerbate the damaging impact of inflation on the bottom groups of the income distribution.

AB  - This study analyzes the effect of monetary policy on inflation by using Sargent and Wallace’s approach. Their assumption is that tight monetary policy is more inflationist than the loose monetary policy in a condition which the public has to borrow. Then, the monetary policy implemented by Turkish Central Bank (CBRT) between 1987 and 2002 is evaluated. It is concluded that CBRT assisted in the rise of inflation by implementing tight monetary policy from 1987 to 1997, and it contributed to the fall of inflation by following relatively loose monetary policy after 1997. Moreover, since the money generation process of CBRT is subject to the foreign assets, it is revealed that CBRT does not have a monopoly power in controlling the inflation rate.
