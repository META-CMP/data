AB  - Chile was the second country in the world to adopt inflation targeting (IT), setting its first annual target in September 1990. IT was used as a device to bring inflation gradually down to a stationary 3% level. This paper analyzes four main questions, exploiting Chile’s long IT experience. Is Chile’s experience different from that of other countries that have adopted IT during the 1990s? Has IT contributed to monetary policy credibility in Chile? Does the monetary authority exhibit fear of floating? Is the Central Bank’s monetary policy function consistent with the goals of IT? The evidence reported in this paper shows that credibility grew as inflation targets were attained, that there is little “fear of floating,” and that monetary policy has evolved according to the strengthening of IT and attainment of stationary inflation.

TI  - Inflation Targeting and Monetary Policy Transmission Mechanisms in Emerging Market Economies
AU  - Mukherjee, Ms Sanchita
AU  - Bhattacharya, Ms Rina
AB  - In this paper we empirically examine the operation of the traditional Keynesian interest rate channel of the monetary policy transmission mechanism in five potential inflation targeting economies in the MENA region and compare it with fourteen inflation targeting (IT) emerging market economies (EMEs) using panel data analysis. Contrary to some existing studies, our empirical results suggest that private consumption and investment in both groups of countries are sensitive to movements in real interest rates. Moreover, we find that the adoption of IT did not significantly alter the operation of the interest rate channel in IT EMEs. Also, the interest rate elasticities of private consumption and private investment vary with the level of development of the domestic financial market. Finally, capital account liberalization have opposite effects on private consumption and private investment in the two groups of countries.

TI  - A Model For Monetary Policy Under Inflation Targeting: The Case Of Israel
AU  - Elkayam, David
T2  - Bank of Israel Working Papers
AB  - In 1992 the Bank of Israel started to implement an inflation targeting regime. In this paper we formulate and estimate a small model to explain the determination of inflation, currency devaluation and the nominal interest rate under an interest rate rule designed to achieve the inflation target. We use quarterly data from the third quarter of 1992 to the third quarter of 2000. Monetary policy is represented by an interest rate rule according to which the nominal interest rate is adjusted according to the gap between inflation expectations and the inflation target, and the gap between the present nominal interest rate and its rate in the long run. In this formulation we use data on inflation expectations derived from the bond market. Inflation in the model is determined by currency devaluation plus the increase in import prices (abroad), inflation expectations and the gap between the short term and the long-term real interest rates. The last item represents the influence of monetary policy on the output gap. Currency devaluation is determined by the gap between domestic inflation and inflation abroad, and by the change in the differential between the domestic interest rate and that abroad. The model can be used for forecasting and for policy analysis, i.e., to evaluate the effect of shocks—for example unexpected devaluation—on the course of the endogenous variables. In such implementation we need to assume how expectations are made. We use two alternatives: rational expectations and adaptive expectations.

TI  - Does monetary policy credibility mitigate the effects of uncertainty about exchange rate on uncertainties about both inflation and interest rate?
AU  - Montes, Gabriel Caldas

T2  - International Economics and Economic Policy
AB  - In the present paper, we investigate the effects of the disagreement in expectations about exchange rate on the disagreements in expectations about inflation and about monetary policy interest rate in Brazil. The analysis seeks to verify whether the uncertainty related to the future behavior of the exchange rate affects both the process of inflation expectation formation and the process of monetary policy interest rate expectation formation. Besides, the paper investigates the role of monetary policy credibility in mitigating the effects of the disagreement in expectations about exchange rate on the disagreements in expectations about inflation and about monetary policy interest rate. The results indicate that the disagreement in expectations about exchange rate impacts the disagreements in expectations about both inflation and monetary policy interest rate. In addition, the findings indicate that credibility is capable of mitigating the transmission of uncertainties about the exchange rate to uncertainties about the inflation rate and the monetary policy interest rate. Thus, our estimates reveal that (i) the marginal effect of disagreement in expectations about exchange rate on the disagreement in expectations about inflation decreases with the level of credibility and, (ii) the marginal effect of disagreement in expectations about exchange rate on the disagreement in expectations about monetary policy interest rate decreases as credibility increases.

AB  - This paper examines the international experiences with four basic types of monetary policy regimes: (1) exchange-rate targeting, (2) monetary targeting, (3) inflation targeting, and (4) monetary policy with an implicit but not an explicit nominal anchor. The basic theme that emerges from this analysis is that transparency and accountability are crucial to constraining discretionary monetary policy so that it produces desirable long-run outcomes. Because the devil is in the details in achieving transparency and accountability, what strategy will work best in a country depends on its political, cultural and economic institutions, as well as on its past history.

AU  - Woodford, Michael
T2  - Journal of Money, Credit and Banking
AB  - I consider some of the leading arguments for assigning an important role to tracking the growth of monetary aggregates when making decisions about monetary policy. First, I consider whether ignoring money means returning to the conceptual framework that allowed the high inflation of the 1970s. Second, I consider whether models of inflation determination with no role for money are incomplete, or inconsistent with elementary economic principles. Third, I consider the implications for monetary policy strategy of the empirical evidence for a long-run relationship between money growth and inflation. And fourth, I consider reasons why a monetary policy strategy based solely on short-run inflation forecasts derived from a Phillips curve may not be a reliable way of controlling inflation. I argue that none of these considerations provides a compelling reason to assign a prominent role to monetary aggregates in the conduct of monetary policy.

AU  - Faust, Jon
AU  - Leeper, Eric
AB  - Presented at Jackson Hole Symposium, August 2015. Abstract: Analytical and quantitative frameworks both at central banks and in academic research generally embed the perspective that in "normal times" the essence of good policy can be captured in the response
of the policy interest rate to normal business cycle fluctuations and that these
fluctuations are well-summarized by the gaps between the perceived
or forecasted levels of output and inflation and their desired levels. Policymakers are, however,
well aware that reality regularly reflects myriad factors that are at odds with any such simple view of
normal cyclical dynamics. We argue that these disparate confounding factors deserve much greater focus and that normal cyclical dynamics, which have been the focus of meticulous study and modelling, are largely a sideshow. We perceive an evolution underway at central banks to better incorporate these confounding factors and provide some suggestions for doing so more reliably.

TI  - Financial Stability, Economic Growth, Inflation and Monetary Policy Linkages in India: An Empirical Reflection
AU  - Dhal, Sarat
T2  - RBI Occasional Papers, Winter 2011
AB  - The paper on “Financial Stability, Economic Growth, Inflation and Monetary Policy Linkages in India: An Empirical Reflection” by Sarat Dhal, Purnendu Kumar and Jugnu Ansari provides an empirical assessment of crucial issues relating to the linkages of financial stability with economic growth and inflation in the Indian context. For this purpose, the study uses vector auto-regression (VAR) model comprising output, inflation, interest rates and a banking sector stability index for a period 1995:Q2 to 2012:Q3. The banking stability index is constructed with capital adequacy, asset quality, management efficiency, earnings and liquidity (CAMEL) indicators. The paper finds that financial stability on the one hand and macroeconomic indicators comprising output, inflation and interest rates on the other hand can share a statistically significant bi-directional Granger block causal relationship. The impulse response function of the VAR model provides some interesting perspectives. First, financial stability, growth and inflation could share a medium-longer-term relationship. Second, enhanced financial stability could be associated with higher growth accompanied by softer interest rates without much threat to price stability in the medium to long term. Third, greater economic stability or higher output growth can enhance financial stability. Fourth, higher inflation or price instability could adversely affect financial stability. Fifth, financial stability can contribute to the effectiveness of monetary transmission mechanisms. Finally, the paper finds that with financial stability, output growth could become more persistent and inflation less persistent.

TI  - Climate and monetary policy: do temperature shocks lead to inflationary pressures?
AU  - Mukherjee, K.

T2  - Climatic Change
AB  - In the race towards economic growth, increased pollutant emissions have spurred the rise in global surface temperatures, intensifying the process of climate change. While the existing literature on the economic impact of climate-related variables has looked at outcomes such as growth, income, fiscal response, and poverty, the effect of temperature shocks on inflation has largely been neglected. This paper is an attempt to fill this lacuna. Indeed, we analyze the dynamic impact of temperature shocks on inflation, a key policy variable of most central banks. We use a panel-VAR method with fixed-effects and a sample of developed and developing countries over the period 1961–2014. Our results suggest that temperature shocks lead to inflationary pressures. Worryingly, and for developing countries in particular, we find that these effects persist several years after the initial shock. Our finding remained unaltered by various robustness checks. We show that these effects pose a threat to monetary policy making. We argue that central banks should pay more attention to temperature shocks.

TI  - THE NON-PRICE EFFECTS OF MONETARY INFLATION - ProQuest
AB  - ABSTRACT: The aim of this paper is to examine the non-price effects of
monetary inflation. An increase in the money supply may lead to price
inflation, but it may also affect the non-price parameters of goods and
services, such as quality or the quantity enclosed in packaging. Based on
our analysis, we claim that an expansionary monetary policy may cause
a decline in quality (quantity) of produced goods and services if the rise
in costs prompts the entrepreneurs not to increase nominal prices of their
product but to decrease their product’s quality (quantity), increasing
its effective price—price adjusted for quality (quantity). In this way, the
increase in money supply may have, ceteris paribus, a negative impact on
innovativeness of entrepreneurs who, instead of improving the quality of
products they offer, may in fact take the opposite action in order to avoid
evident nominal price increases of their products.

AU  - Salehi Rezveh, Masoud
T2  - Economic Growth and Development Research
AB  - This paper investigates the monetary policy reaction of the Central Bank of Iran with threshold effects. The estimation of the nonlinear reaction function is carried out using a two-step procedure. At first step of this procedure, we follow Caner and Hansen's (2004) threshold approach. Using the Taylor empirical rules and threshold variables including inflation and output gap we estimate the relevant threshold values. Then, to infer the monetary policy preferences, we employ these threshold values to estimate the asymmetric policy reaction function specified by Favero and Rovelli (2003) and Komlan(2013).This is done by Generalized Method of Moment (GMM). Experimental results show that the asymmetry parameter of the output gap is statistically significant. Thus, the Central Bank reacts more vigorously to negative than to positive output gaps. Also, the results suggest that Central Bank reacts only when the inflation rate is higher than the threshold. This fact indicates that the monetary authorities seek to improve the output and employment, and the priority of controling inflation rate is not considered during the study period.

TI  - Learning About a Shift in Trend Output: Implications for Monetary Policy and Inflation
AU  - Lansing, Kevin J.
AB  - This paper develops a small forward-looking macroeconomic model where the Federal Reserve estimates the level of potential output in real time by running a regression on past output data. The Fed's perceived output gap is used as an input to the monetary policy rule while the true output gap influences aggregate demand and inflation. I investigate the consequences of two postulated shifts in the growth rate of U.S. potential output: the first occurs in the early-1970s and the second in the mid-1990s. Initially, Fed policymakers interpret these shifts to be cyclical shocks but their regression algorithm allows them to gradually discover the truth as the economy evolves over time. Under a Taylor-type rule, the model can produce a hump-shaped pattern in trend inflation that peaks around 1979 and a downward movement in trend inflation since 1995. Under a nominal income growth rule, these low-frequency movements in inflation are substantially reduced but not eliminated. The business cycle stabilization properties of the two rules turn out to be quite similar. Finally, using stochastic simulations, I show that efforts to identify the Fed's policy rule using a regression based on final data can create the illusion of strong interest rate smoothing behavior when in fact none exists.

TI  - Monetary policy and wage bargaining in the EMU: restrictive ECB policies, high unemployment, nominal wage restraint and inflation above the target
AU  - Hein, Eckhard
T2  - PSL Quarterly Review
AB  - Assessing the effects of monetary policy and wage bargaining on employment andinflation in the European Monetary Union (EMU), the first step sees development of a Post-Keynesian competitive claims model of inflation with endogenous money. In this model the NAIRU is considered to be a short-run limit to employment enforced by independent and conservative central banks. In the long run, however, the NAIRU will follow actual unemployment and is therefore also dependent on the forces determining aggregate demand, including monetary policies. But the NAIRU may also be reduced through effectively co-ordinated wage bargaining, as has been shown by institutional political economists. Applying these considerations to the economic performance of the EMU, different scenarios determined by wage bargainingcoordination and the European Central Bank's (ECB) monetary policies are developed. It is shown that the first phase of the EMU was dominated by uncoordinated wage bargaining across the EMU and an "anti-growth-bias" of theECB. Thus the euro area was plagued with nominal wage restraint, highunemployment and inflation above the ECB target. Economic performance will improve if the ECB abandons its asymmetric monetary strategy. This may be facilitated by a higher degree of effective wage bargaining co-ordination across the EMU. JEL Codes: E52, J52, F36, J31

TI  - Inflation Targeting and Financial Stability
AU  - Woodford, Michael
AB  - A number of commentators have argued that the desirability of inflation targeting as a framework for monetary policy analysis should be reconsidered in light of the global financial crisis, on the ground that it requires neglect of the implications of monetary policy for financial stability. This paper argues that monetary policy may indeed affect the severity of risks to financial stability, but that it is possible to generalize an inflation targeting framework to take account of financial stability concerns alongside traditional stabilization objectives. The resulting framework can still be viewed as a form of flexible inflation targeting; in particular, the paper proposes a target criterion that would still imply an invariant long-run price level, despite fluctuations over time in risks to financial stability or even the occurrence of occasional financial crises.

The experience of MPC members on their inflation performance is then compared, opposing inflation targeters with non-targeters. Our sample covers the major Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development countries, in the period 1999-2008. Our results first show that MPCs are different in inflation-targeting (versus non-targeting) countries. They also reveal that policy-makers’ backgrounds influence inflation, and that the influence of MPCs’ experience is much greater in inflation-targeting countries, while size effects are more important for committees that do not target inflation.

T2  - Journal of Applied Econometrics
AB  - Empirical monetary policy research has increased in the last decade, possibly because deregulation and explicit monetary targets have made monetary policy issues more interesting. In particular, within the inflation targeting framework it has been argued that inflation forecasts can be used as optimal intermediate targets for monetary policy, and the development of empirical models that have good forecasting properties is therefore important. This paper shows that a VAR model with long-run restrictions, justified by economic theory, is useful for both forecasting inflation and for analysing other issues that are central to the conduct of monetary policy.

One such instrument to be evaluated is monetary policy. In this paper, we study precisely how monetary policy aﬀects the real income volatility of Black and white households, in a framework where the monetary authority faces a trade-oﬀ between unemployment and inﬂation. Our assessment is informed by four empirical regularities: (i) the unemployment rate for Black individuals is about twice as high than the unemployment rate for white individuals, at all times; (ii) though the levels diﬀer, the unemployment rates for Black and white individuals move closely over the business cycle; (iii) labor income represents a larger portion of overall income for Black than for white households; (iv) Black households experience higher price volatility with respect to white households. We argue that (i) and (ii) imply that proposals postulating that monetary policy targets Black unemployment are equivalent to a policy accepting larger inﬂation ﬂuctuations. At the same time, (iii) and (iv) imply that the real income volatility of Black households is more directly aﬀected by inﬂation changes. In our quantitative evaluation, we ﬁnd that Black households gain disproportionately more from accommodative monetary policy so long as inﬂation expectations remain anchored. With unanchored expectations, on the other hand, the beneﬁt from reducing unemployment become smaller and the erosion of real income from higher inﬂation dominates.

T2  - INTERDISCIPLINARY JOURNAL OF AFRICAN & ASIAN STUDIES (IJAAS)
AB  - This study examined the effects of monetary policy in combating inflation in Nigeria. The main objective of this study was to assess the effect of monetary policy instruments in curbing inflation in Nigeria. The study used annual time series data from 1986-2019 which were sourced from Central Bank of Nigeria Statistical Bulletin. It used inflation rate as the dependent variable while money supply, monetary policy rate, exchange rate and government expenditure were used as the explanatory variables. The study employed Autoregressive Distributed Lag (ARDL) model for its analysis. The findings indicated that interest rate and exchange rate exerted a positive and significant effect on inflation in Nigeria both in the short run and long-run . However, monetary policy rate was not significant in influencing inflation rate in the long-run but was found to be significant in the short-run. It was therefore concluded that while interest rate and exchange rate are potent tools of controlling inflation, monetary policy rate is not very effective in controlling inflationary pressure in Nigeria. Based on these findings, the study recommended that the Central Bank in collaboration with commercial banks should control inflation by keeping the interest rate at reasonable level in order to control inflation.

TI  - Low inflation, pass-through, and the pricing power of firms
AU  - Taylor, John B.
T2  - European Economic Review
AB  - Recently there has been a significant decline in the degree to which firms ‘pass through’ changes in costs to prices, a decline that is frequently characterized as a reduction in the ‘pricing power’ of firms. The decline appears to be associated with the decline in inflation in many countries. The decline has important implications for monetary policy because it affects both forecasts of inflation and the effects of changes in monetary policy on inflation. Some have argued that the decline in pricing power helped to keep inflation low in the face of apparently strong demand pressures in the United States in the late 1990s. This paper puts forth the view that the decline in pass-through or pricing power is due to the low inflation environment that has recently been achieved in many countries. First, a microeconomic model of price setting is used to show that lower pass-through is caused by lower perceived persistence of cost changes. Evidence is then presented showing that inflation is positively correlated with persistence of inflation, suggesting that the low inflation itself has caused the low pass-through. An economy-wide model consistent with the micromodel is then presented to illustrate how such changes in pricing power affect output and inflation dynamics in favorable ways, but can disappear quickly if monetary policy and expectations change.

TI  - Monetary Policy in an Era of Capital Market Inflation
AU  - Toporowski, Jan
AB  - The theory of capital market inflation argues that the values of long-term securities markets are determined by a disequilibrium inflow of funds into those markets. The resulting over-capitalization of companies leads to increased fragility of banking and undermines monetary policy and stable relationships between short- and long-term interest rates, such as that postulated by Keynes in his theory of the speculative demand for money. Moreover, while the increased fragility of banking is an immediate effect, capital market inflation also creates an unstable Ponzi financing structure in the capital market as a whole.

TI  - A VAR Model of Monetary Policy and Hypothetical Case of Inflation Targeting in India
AU  - Mishra, Ankita
AU  - Mishra, Vinod
AB  - The empirical VAR literature on identification and measurement of the impact of monetary policy shocks on the real side of the economy is fairly comprehensive for developed economies but very limited for emerging and transition economies. In this study, we propose an identification scheme, for a developing economy taking India as a case study, which is able to capture the monetary transmission mechanism without giving rise to any empirical anomalies. We use a VAR approach with recursive contemporaneous restrictions and identify monetary policy shocks by modelling the reaction function of the central bank and structure of the economy. The effect of monetary policy shocks on the exchange rate and other macroeconomic variables is consistent with the predictions of a broad set of theoretical models. This set-up is used to build a hypothetical case of inflation targeting where the monetary policy instrument is set after looking at the current values of inflation only. This is in contrast with the „multiple indicator approach‟ currently followed by Reserve Bank of India. This hypothetical scenario of inflation targeting suggests a sharper response of the interest rate (monetary policy instrument) to shocks and strengthening of the exchange rate channel in transmission of interest rate impulses. This study also provides some useful implications on the type of theoretical framework which can be used to model the evolution of monetary policy for a developing economy like India.

AB  - In this paper, we review a range of approaches used to capture monetary policy in a period of Zero Lower Bound (ZLB). We concentrate here on methods closely linked to interest rates, which include: spreads, synthetic indices from principal component analysis, and different shadow rates. Next, we calculate these measures for the euro area, draw comparisons among different approaches, and look at the effects on main macroeconomic variables, with a special focus on inflation. By and large, the impact of unconventional monetary policy shocks on inflation is found to be significantly positive across studies and methods. Finally, we summarize the literature on the Natural Real Rate of Interest. This overview may help to assess how long low (real) interest rates in a ZLB stay in place, potentially leading to more accurate policy recommendations.

TI  - INFLATION TARGETING AND THE SACRIFICE RATIO: THE EFFECT OF MONETARY POLICY DESIGN
AU  - Tunali, Demet
AB  - We analyze the effect of the monetary policy design features, consistent with an inflation targeting (IT) regime, on the output cost of disinflation. This is the first study examining the IT regime by directly measuring the monetary policy design for a broad range of countries, instead of using a dummy variable that only accounts for its existence. We construct several indexes using the Central Bank of England’s survey of policy characteristics conducted in 1999 in 93 countries. We examine the impact of overall indexes and its individual components. We also group countries by dividing the indexes into quartiles to detect a possible non-linear relation and the impact of individual indicators. Additionally, we analyze the sovereign debt ratings and exchange rate arrangements to investigate the institutional reform that had to be undertaken to establish the credibility of this regime. The first set of results shows that, in line with the literature’s description of their monetary policies, U.S. and Japan are ranked remarkably close to the early targeters of New Zealand, U.K., Canada and Australia. Chile, Korea and Peru score noticeably week in conducting this regime. Compared with the anecdotal evidence in the recent studies, indexes point out to noticeable structural changes particularly in Mexico and Peru along with the potential targeters of the time within a matter few years. This study therefore urges for an updated survey. The second set of results indicate that the low degree of discretion among OECD countries and financing of the government by the central bank in the full sample significantly reduce the inflationoutput cost of disinflation. These results are robust to the size of disinflation and the estimation method. Finally, it is found that the group of countries in the lowest index level deteriorates the linear impact of the total indexes.

T2  - Political Science Research and Methods
AB  - Governments’ party identifications can indicate the types of economic
                        policies they are likely to pursue. A common rule of thumb is that
                        left-party governments are expected to pursue policies for lower
                        unemployment, but which may cause inflation. Right-party governments are
                        expected to pursue lower inflation policies. How do these expectations shape
                        the inflation forecasts of monetary policy bureaucrats? If there is a
                        mismatch between the policies, bureaucrats expect
                        governments to implement, and those that they actually do,
                        forecasts will be systematically biased. Using US Federal Reserve Staff’s
                        forecasts we test for executive partisan biases. We find that irrespective
                        of actual policy and economic conditions forecasters systematically
                        overestimate future inflation during left-party presidencies and
                        underestimate future inflation during right-party ones. Our findings suggest
                        that partisan heuristics play an important part in monetary policy
                        bureaucrats’ inflation expectations.

AU  - Ascari, Guido
AU  - Sbordone, Argia M.
T2  - Journal of Economic Literature
AB  - Most macroeconomic models for monetary policy analysis are approximated around a zero inflation steady state, but most central banks target an inflation rate of about 2 percent. Many economists have recently proposed even higher inflation targets to reduce the incidence of the zero lower bound constraint on monetary policy. In this survey, we show that the conduct of monetary policy should be analyzed by appropriately accounting for the positive trend inflation targeted by policymakers. We first review empirical research on the evolution and dynamics of U.S. trend inflation and some proposed new measures to assess the volatility and persistence of trend-based inflation gaps. We then construct a Generalized New Keynesian model that accounts for a positive trend inflation. In this model, an increase in trend inflation is associated with a more volatile and unstable economy and tends to destabilize inflation expectations. This analysis offers a note of caution regarding recent proposals to address the existing zero lower bound problem by raising the long-run inflation target.

AB  - obtained from CBN statistical bulletin from 1990Q1 to 2019Q4.&nbsp; Monetary policy was proxied by monetary policy rate (MPR), prime lending rate (PLR), maximum lending rate (MLR), and treasury bills rate (TBR). The study employed Structural Equation Modelling (SEM) in analysis. It was found that monetary policy rate, prime lending rate, maximum lending rate, and treasury bills rate impacted positively on inflation in Nigeria. It was also found that industrial output impacted negatively on inflation, implying that an increase in industrial output will lead to a reduction in inflation in Nigeria. The study also found that industrial output played a partial mediation on the relationship between prime lending rate (PLR), maximum lending rate (MLR), and inflation but a complete mediation was found for industrial output on the relationship between monetary policy rates (MPR), treasury bills rate (TBR) and inflation in Nigeria. The study concluded that when industrial output is used as a mediator variable, on the relationship between monetary policy and inflation; monetary policy can effectively reduce inflation indirectly by boosting industrial output or production. The study recommends that to achieve the monetary policy objective of price stability, the monetary authority should reduce MPR, PLR, MLR, and TBR to boost industrial output, as industrial output has the potential of reducing the inflation rate in Nigeria.

AU  - Mignon, Valerie
AB  - In this paper, we estimate the exchange rate pass-through (ERPT) to consumer prices and assess its dynamics for a sample of 15 emerging countries over the 1994-2015 period. To this end, we augment the traditional bivariate relationship between the nominal eﬀective exchange rate and inﬂation by accounting for the inﬂation environment, monetary policy regime, as well as domestic institutional factors. We show that both the level and volatility of inﬂation matter in the sense that declining ERPT is evidenced with more stable and anti-inﬂationary environment. Monetary policy also plays a key role since adopting an inﬂation target—especially de jure—leads to a signiﬁcant reduction in ERPT for most countries. Adopting exchange rate targeting regime matters as well, contributing to a diminishing ERPT. Finally, we ﬁnd evidence that transparency of monetary policy decisions clearly reduces ERPT, while this is not the case for central bank independence.

This new consensus reproduces received wisdom: in the long run, expansionary fiscal policy leads to higher inflation rates and real interest rates, while more restrictive monetary policy only leads to lower inflation rates. The paper provides a simple four-quadrant apparatus to represent the above, and it shows that simple modifications to the new consensus model are enough to radically modify received doctrine as to the likely effects of fiscal and monetary policies.

T2  - Journal of Economic Perspectives
AB  - The half-decade running from mid-1982 to mid-1987 was a pretty good era for U.S. monetary policy, as these things go. Even the severe 1981-82 recession served its intended purpose of substantially restoring price stability. At least as judged by the outcomes for the standard objectives of macroeconomic policy, U.S. monetary policy was a distinct success. Economists hoping to say something useful about monetary policy in the 1980s have had a tougher time. The quantitative relationships connecting income and price movements to the growth of familiar monetary aggregates, including especially the M1 measure of the money stock that had been the chief focus of monetary policy during 1979-82, utterly fell apart during this period. It is difficult to escape the conclusion that there is now a conceptual vacuum at the center of the U.S. monetary policymaking process. In the meanwhile, the Federal Reserve System has not ceased operations. Nor should it be inclined to do so, in light of the performance of both income and prices during the past half-decade.

AB  - We describe the inflation targeting framework (ITF) and compare it against hypothetical best-practice based on optimization.  The core requirements of the ITF are an explicit long-run inflation goal and a commitment to transparency in policymaking.  Advocates and practitioners of the ITF have made many contributions to clear goal setting and communication by central banks.  However, we contend that ITF communication policies both as advocated and practiced often have some elements that either obfuscate or, in some cases, explicitly contradict the dictates of optimization in a stabilization-policy paradigm.  In this paradigm, the central bank has an objective function that places weight on both inflation and output-gap stabilization and faces a conventional (exploitable) Phillips-curve trade-off.  We point out some problems that the ITF communication policy may generate in this setting.  Our analysis leads us to make four suggestions for communication policy intended to help central banks avoid these problems.

TI  - The New Output-Inflation Trade-Off
AU  - Walsh, Carl E.
T2  - Handbook of Monetary Policy
AB  - This chapter discusses the new output-inflation trade-off and its implications for the design of monetary policy. One of the hallmarks of economic analysis is the recognition that choice involves tradeoffs. Whether it’s a consumer deciding if the roominess of a sports utility vehicle is worth the lower gas mileage, or a firm deciding whether lower wages of an overseas production facility compensate for the lower worker productivity, or Congress deciding whether a new expenditure program justifies the higher taxes needed to finance it, trade-offs must be faced. Much of knowledge of variability trade-offs comes from simulations of models designed to mimic the behavior of the major industrialized economies. These models incorporate realistic inflation and output adjustment so that they can be used to study the variability trade-off implied by different rules for conducting monetary policy. Realizing that long-run effects of monetary policy determine average inflation, not average unemployment or economy’s real rate of growth, is critical to maintaining successful policy.

AB  - We discuss the evolution in macroeconomic thought on the monetary policy transmission mechanism and present related empirical evidence. The core channels of policy transmission — the neoclassical links between short-term policy interest rates, other asset prices such as long-term interest rates, equity prices, and the exchange rate, and the consequent effects on household and business demand — have remained steady from early policy-oriented models (like the Penn-MIT-SSRC MPS model) to modern dynamic, stochastic general equilibrium (DSGE) models. In contrast, non-neoclassical channels, such as credit-based channels, have remained outside the core models. In conjunction with this evolution in theory and modeling, there have been notable changes in policy behavior (with policy more focused on price stability) and in the reduced form correlations of policy interest rates with activity in the United States. Regulatory effects on credit provision have also changed significantly. As a result, we review the empirical evidence on the changes in the effect of monetary policy actions on real activity and inflation and present new evidence, using both a relatively unrestricted factor-augmented vector autoregression (FAVAR) and a DSGE model. Both approaches yield similar results: Monetary policy innovations have a more muted effect on real activity and inflation in recent decades as compared to the effects before 1980. Our analysis suggests that these shifts are accounted for by changes in policy behavior and the effect of these changes on expectations, leaving little role for changes in underlying private-sector behavior (outside shifts related to monetary policy changes).

TI  - Indonesia's Monetary Policy Dilemma: Constraints of Inflation Targeting
AU  - Chowdhury, Anis
AU  - Siregar, Hermanto
T2  - The Journal of Developing Areas
AB  - This research was motivated by current constraints on macroeconomic policy-making in Indonesia. On the fiscal side, the government is burdened with debt and the pressure to maintain social expenditure. On the monetary side, there is a preoccupation with a lower inflation rate which conflicts with the need to maintain liquidity in a repressed economy. By examining the inflation-growth relationship, this study examines whether there is any room for inflating the economy. This would ease the pressure on government debt repayment while maintaining social expenditure, and the fragile economic recovery would not be stalled by prematurely tightening monetary policy. The study finds a two-way relationship between inflation and growth; but there is some evidence of long-run neutrality of money. This implies that inflation is unlikely to affect economic growth adversely in the long-run. Based on a simple model that explicitly takes into account inflation-growth trade off, it is found that there is room for a higher inflation rate than what is currently targeted. Thus, this study favours a more expansionary macroeconomic policy mix.

AB  - This paper examines how various monetary policy signals such as repo rate changes, inflation reports, speeches, and minutes from monetary policy meetings affect the term structure of interest rates. We find that unexpected movements in the short end of the yield curve are mainly driven by unexpected changes in the repo rate. However, published inflation reports and speeches also have some impact on short rates. Speeches are found to be a more important determinant for the longer end of the term structure. Our conclusion is that central bank communication is an essential part of the conduct of monetary policy.

AU  - Orphanides, Athanasios

AB  - What monetary policy framework, if adopted by the Federal Reserve, would have avoided the Great Inflation of the 1960s and 1970s? We use counterfactual simulations of an estimated model of the U.S. economy to evaluate alternative monetary policy strategies. We show that policies constructed using modern optimal control techniques aimed at stabilizing inflation, economic activity, and interest rates would have succeeded in achieving a high degree of economic stability as well as price stability only if the Federal Reserve had possessed excellent information regarding the structure of the economy or if it had acted as if it placed relatively low weight on stabilizing the real economy. Neither condition held true. We document that policymakers at the time both had an overly optimistic view of the natural rate of unemployment and put a high priority on achieving full employment. We show that in the presence of realistic informational imperfections and with an emphasis on stabilizing economic activity, an optimal control approach would have failed to keep inflation expectations well anchored, resulting in high and highly volatile inflation during the 1970s. Finally, we show that a strategy of following a robust first-difference policy rule would have been highly effective at stabilizing inflation and unemployment in the presence of informational imperfections. This robust monetary policy rule yields simulated outcomes that are close to those seen during the period of the Great Moderation starting in the mid-1980s.

TI  - Historical monetary policy analysis and the Taylor rule
AU  - Orphanides, Athanasios
T2  - Journal of Monetary Economics
AB  - This study examines the usefulness of the Taylor-rule framework as an organizing device for describing the policy debate and evolution of monetary policy in the United States. Monetary policy during the 1920s and since the 1951 Treasury-Federal Reserve Accord can be broadly interpreted in terms of this framework with rather surprising consistency. In broad terms, during these periods policy has been generally formulated in a forward-looking manner with price stability and economic stability serving as implicit or explicit guides. As early as the 1920s, measures of real economic activity relative to “normal” or “potential” supply appear to have influenced policy analysis and deliberations. Confidence in such measures as guides for activist monetary policy proved counterproductive at times, resulting in excessive activism, such as during the Great Inflation and at the brink of the Great Depression. Policy during the past two decades is broadly consistent with natural growth targeting variants of the Taylor rule that exhibit less activism.

We show that it contains information not covered by usual inflation risk indicators which focus on inflation uncertainty and do not distinguish between the risks of low or high future inflation outcomes. Not only the extent but also the asymmetry of inflation risks evolve over time. Moreover, changes in this asymmetry have an impact on future inflation realizations as well as on the current interest rate central banks target.

AB  - We analyze the determinants of average individual inflation uncertainty and the cross-sectional variance of point forecasts (“disagreement”) based on data from the European Central Bank's Survey of Professional Forecasters. We empirically confirm the implication from a theoretical variance decomposition that disagreement is an incomplete approximation to overall uncertainty. Both measures are associated with macroeconomic conditions and indicators of monetary policy, but the relations differ qualitatively. In particular, average individual inflation uncertainty is higher during periods of expansionary monetary policy, whereas disagreement rises during contractionary periods. This implies that conclusions based on disagreement as a single indicator of ex ante uncertainty are incomplete and potentially misleading.

AU  - Pfäuti, Oliver
AB  - I propose an approach to quantify attention to inflation in the data and show that the decrease in the volatility and persistence of U.S. inflation after the Great Inflation period was accompanied by a decline in the public's attention to inflation. This decline in attention has important implications for monetary policy as it renders managing inflation expectations more difficult and can lead to inflation-attention traps: prolonged periods of a binding lower bound and low inflation due to slowly-adjusting inflation expectations. As attention declines the optimal policy response is to increase the inflation target.

This is especially true for central banks, which need to build credibility among the general public. This paper analyses how favorably the print media report about the European Central Bank's (ECB) monetary policy decisions. Favorableness is, inter alia, influenced by the amount of information communicated by the ECB. There are, however, also indications of a critical monitoring role of the media, which reports more negatively when inflation exceeds the inflation target.

AU  - Friedman, Benjamin M.
AB  - The experience of U.S. monetary policy during 1979-82 provided useful and potentially important new evidence about how monetary policy affects economic activity. This paper considers, inthe light of that evidence, six familiar propositions supporting the use of monetary aggregate targets for monetary policy. These propositions deal with money and nominal income, with price inflation and real economic growth, and with long-term interest rates. The evidence from the1979-82 experiment leads to doubt rather than confidence in each of these six propositions, and hence doubt rather than confidence in the use of monetary aggregate targets.

We set up a small structural macro model of these three economies to account for the process of disinflation. We show that a simple macro model, with forward-looking inflation and exchange rate expectations, can adequately characterize the relationship between the output gap, inflation, the real interest rate and the exchange rate during this period. This model allows us to assess the relative importance of the interest rate and exchange rate channels in determining the path of disinflation.

First, changes in monetary policy, as measured by the narrative-based policy indices, are associated with persistent changes in the levels of M2 and the monetary base. In contrast, changes in the narrative policy indicators lead to transitory changes in short-term interest rates, nonborrowed reserves, and the spread between the six-month commercial paper rate and the three-month treasury bill rate. Third, these findings are generally robust across different narrative-based policy indices.

TI  - Impact of Monetary Policy on Inflation and Investment in Pakistan: A Time Series Analysis | Journal of Accounting and Finance in Emerging Economies
AB  - Purpose: This study aims to explore the impact of monetary policy on inflation and investment in Pakistan.
Methodology: Our study employs the Autoregressive distributed lag model (ARDL) over the time of 1972 to 2019.
Findings: The empirical findings show that in the long-run impact of money supply has significant and positive on investment and other variables trade, foreign direct investment, gross domestic saving, services are also positively associated with the investment. While other variables interest rate and exchange rate negatively linked with investment. Empirical findings of the second econometric model show the core variable money supply has a significant and positive on inflation including other variables foreign direct investment, exchange rate, exports and government expenditures on education but other variables interest rate, gross domestic saving and agriculture output negatively linked with inflation.
Implications: The study indicates that a stable monetary policy should be introduced to improve a country's economic development. Monetary policy should be used to build an agreeable environment of uncertainty that draws both domestic and outside investors to promote economic growth. Economic growth can be accomplished by encouraging efficient monetary policy steps for inflation stability and attractive interest rates.

TI  - From Monetary Targeting to Inflation Targeting
AU  - Mishkin, Frederic S.
AB  - The author examines changes in monetary policy in industrial countries by evaluating, and providing case studies of monetary targeting, and inflation targeting. Inflation targeting has successfully controlled inflation, with some qualifications. It weakens the effects of inflationary shocks, as examples from Canada, Sweden, and the United Kingdom show. It can promote growth, and does not lead to increased fluctuations in output. But inflation targets do not necessarily reduce the cost of reducing inflation. The key to success of inflation targeting, is its stress on transparency, and communication with the public. Inflation targeting increases accountability, which helps ameliorate the time-inconsistency trap (in which the central bank tries to expand output, and employment in the short run, by pursuing overly expansionary monetary policy). Time-inconsistency is more likely to come from political pressures on the central bank, to engage in overly expansionary monetary policy. A key advantage of inflation targeting, is that it helps focus the political debate on what a central bank can do in the long run (control inflation) rather than what it cannot do (raise economic growth, and the number of jobs permanently through expansionary monetary policy). By increasing transparency, and accountability, inflation targeting helps promote central bank independence. Accountability to the general public seems to work as well as direct accountability to the government. Inflation targeting is consistent with democratic principles. In discussing operational design, the author explains, among other things, that: 1) Inflation targeting is far from rigid rule. 2) Inflation targets have always been above zero with no loss of credibility. 3) Inflation targeting does not ignore traditional stabilization goals. 4) Avoiding undershoots of the inflation target, is as important, as avoiding overshoots. 5) When inflation is initially high, inflation targeting may have to be phased-in after disinflation. 6)The edges of the target range, can take on a life of their own. 7) Targeting asset prices, such as the exchange rate, worsens performance.

AU  - Coenen, Günter
T2  - Journal of Economic Dynamics and Control
AB  - This paper examines the performance of optimised interest-rate rules when there is uncertainty about a key determinant of the monetary transmission mechanism, namely the degree of persistence characterising the inflation process. The paper focuses on the euro area and utilises two variants of an estimated small-scale macroeconomic model featuring distinct types of staggered contracts specifications which induce quite different degrees of inflation persistence. The paper shows that a cautious monetary policy-maker is well-advised to design and implement interest-rate policies under the assumption that inflation persistence is high when there is considerable uncertainty about the prevailing degree of inflation persistence. Such policies are characterised by a relatively aggressive response to inflation developments and exhibit a substantial degree of inertia.

TI  - The Causes of Inflation
AU  - Mishkin, Frederic S.
AB  - This paper attempts to provide a perspective on the causes of inflation by exploring why sustained inflations occur and the role of monetary policy in the inflation process. The conclusion reached in this paper is that in the last ten years there has been a convergence of views in the economics profession on the causes of inflation. As long as inflation is appropriately defined to be a sustained inflation, macro-economic analysis, whether of the monetarist or Keynesian persuasion, leads to agreement with Milton Friedman's famous dictum, "Inflation is always and everywhere a monetary phenomenon." However, the conclusion that inflation is a monetary phenomenon does not settle the issue of what causes inflation because we also need to understand why inflationary monetary policy occurs. This paper also examines this issue and it finds that the underlying cause of inflationin the United States has been accommodating monetary policy geared to achieving a high employment target. The role of expectations has been important in the inflationary process so that to prevent the resurgence of inflation at a minimum cost in terms of unemployment and output loss, monetary policy must be both non-accommodating and credible.

AB  - This paper refers to the literature on the effects of central bank announcements on inflation expectations in developing countries. In particular, based on the Colombian experience, we study the impact of interest rate announcements and macroeconomic shocks on breakeven inflation rates, given the monetary policy credibility scenario. The empirical evidence is implemented by regression analysis using an EGARCH model between 2008-2016. We find that inflation expectations respond to policy statements in Colombia. Our results show that the central bank pronouncements were more effective in anchoring expectations in the period 2012-2016 and the greater monetary policy credibility allows inflation expectations to be more stable before external shocks.

AU  - Reschreiter, Andreas
T2  - Economic Modelling
AB  - This paper studies the effects of the monetary policy regime shift to inflation targeting on the stochastic properties of the real interest rate in the U.K. The empirical analysis suggests a constant mean of the real interest rate that shifts with the monetary policy regime change to inflation targeting in October 1992. The mean-reverting level of the real interest rate has decreased from 5.1% to 2.3% per annum with the change in monetary policy to inflation targeting. In addition, the shift in monetary policy regime to inflation targeting has reduced the volatility of the real interest rate and increased the persistence of real interest rate deviations from the mean. The results suggest that the central bank can affect the stochastic properties of the real interest rate through the choice of monetary policy regime over a long period of time.

AB  - This paper examines the way monetary policy has been conducted recently in the seven largest Latin American economies. We run 16 alternative specifications for the Taylor rule and select the most appropriate functional form through out-of-sample measures of forecasting performance. We find strong empirical support for endogenous monetary policy reacting to macroeconomic variables. We find empirical evidence that Mexico and Brazil pursues a ‘tough’ monetary policy, whereas Chile and Peru appear to pursue ‘mild’ monetary policy against inflation. Apparently, Argentina, Colombia and Venezuela do not change nominal interest rates to tackle inflation fluctuations and adopt ‘lax’ monetary policies. Exchange rate change seems to be a relevant variable for interest rate decisions only for Mexico, whereas the output gap only appears to matter to Chile, Colombia and Venezuela.

AB  - In recent years, an inflation targeting framework for monetary policy has been adopted in a number of industrial countries. This paper discusses the practical issues that have arisen under the operation of the new framework, and highlights five features of the framework: the assignment of the target, the interaction with other policy goals, the definition of the target, accountability and the role of inflation forecasts. The economic performance of the inflation targeting countries thus far is summarized.

TI  - Efficiency of monetary policy under inflation targeting
AU  - Aguir, Abdelkader
T2  - Economics Bulletin
AB  - The policy of inflation targeting is a monetary regime which seeks inflation. His practice was marked by a high stability observed. A debate emerged on the effectiveness and economic performance of this regime. Many searches are interested in this issue without being able to even reach an ultimate consensus. The objective of this paper is to contribute to this debate by clarifying the origin of this monetary regime and by proposing, then, our own quantitative analysis grid. At first, we discusses the theoretical framework of the inflation targeting relating to these conceptual and analytical aspects that seem to complete the reflection on the earlier antinomy. The analysis then focuses on empirical verification. In drawing on the work of Cecchetti and Krause (2002), Flores-Lagoons and Krause (2006) and Mishkin and Schmidt Hebbel (2007), we estimate efficient frontier: inflation variability-output variability, which allows us to deduce the measurement of economic performance and monetary policy efficiency measure.

AU  - Ciccarelli, Matteo

AB  - This paper explores the role that inflation forecasts play in the uncertainty surrounding the estimated effects of alternative monetary rules on unemployment dynamics in the euro area and the US. We use the inflation forecasts of 8 competing models in a standard Bayesian VAR to analyse the size and the timing of these effects, as well as to quantify the uncertainty relative to the different inflation models under two rules. The results suggest that model uncertainty can be a serious issue and strengthen the case for a policy strategy that takes into account several sources of information. We find that combining inflation forecasts from many models not only yields more accurate forecasts than those of any specific model, but also reduces the uncertainty associated with the real effects of policy decisions. These results are in line with the model-combination approach that central banks already follow when conceiving their strategy.

AB  - Monetary shocks are proposed as a means of economic control in the world's economic systems. The exchange rate and its changes, as one of the macroeconomic variables and the price of foreign currency in the domestic currency, have a significant effect on other macroeconomic variables such as inflation, production, exports, imports, balance of payments and so on. Vast changes in exchange rates can affect the country's macroeconomic variables by affecting the supply and demand of the economy. Thus, according to the proposed issues, this study intends to use the 18-year experience of inflation targeting framework adopted by industrial and developing countries so as to investigate the relationship between monetary shocks on the real exchange rate and the trade balance in some of these countries. The results of the extended torque models’ estimates for developed countries indicate that the real exchange rate stabilization policy and trade expansion and trade balance improvement in the studied developed countries have been studied and is a function of the stabile and long-term macro-economic policies and has been properly implemented. The results also showed a positive relationship between gross domestic production and the real exchange rate and existence of a liquidity shock and inflation increases the real exchange rate in the countries studied in the research. Results in developing countries also show that liquidity and rising prices and inflation do not move in a same direction.

T2  - Macroeconomic Dynamics
AB  - We aim at establishing whether the institutional adoption of inflation targeting has changed the conduct of monetary policy. To do so, we test the hypothesis of inflation targeting translating into a stronger response to inflation in a Taylor rule with three alternative econometric models: a structural break model, a time-varying parameter model with stochastic volatility, and a Markov-switching VAR model. We conclude that inflation targeting has not led to a stronger response to inflation in the reaction function of the monetary authority. This result suggests that inflation targeting being meant to anchor inflation expectations through enhanced credibility and accountability, it may enable a central bank to stabilize inflation without pursuing aggressive action toward inflation variations.

AB  - One decade of inflation targeting in the world offers lessons on the design and implementation of inflation targeting, the conduct of monetary policy, and country performance under inflation targeting. This paper reviews briefly the main design features of 18 inflation targeting experiences, analyzes statistically if countries under inflation targeting are structurally different from non-inflation targeting industrial countries, and reviews existing evidence about the success of inflation targeting. The interaction of inflation targeting design features and the conduct of monetary policy during transition to low inflation are tackled next. The paper ends by focusing on unresolved issues on design and implementation of inflation targeting and their relation to the conduct of monetary policy open issues that have to be addressed in the next decade of inflation targeting.

Yet, non-atomistic wage setters are a key feature of several industrialized economies. We study the economic consequence of non-atomistic agents and show that this qualifies previous results on the effects and desirability of a conservative central banker. In particular, the central bank aversion to inflation may have a permanent effect on structural employment, while no such effect emerges with atomistic agents.

AB  - We construct a new indicator to capture media sentiment about the European Central Bank monetary policy and its relevant environment by analyzing 25,000 articles from five major international newspapers. Using named entity recognition and part-of-speech tagging, we propose a methodology to dissociate the dissemination of official communications of the central bank from the media comments. The resulting (daily) index correlates with some (monthly) standard measures of economic sentiment but reveals idiosyncratic information on monetary policy. Analyzing the determinants of our index, we find that both press conference and inter-meeting communications of the President significantly affect media sentiment. We then show that, controlling for a large range of factors, daily changes in media sentiment have predictive power for financial market inflation expectations.

However, no one fully understands the nature of these changes or the role they play in the current context.

T2  - Economic Modelling
AB  - After more than two decades of inflation targeting in the world, it is important to evaluate if the adoption of this regime in a relevant developing country contributed to the creation of a better environment for the process of entrepreneurs' expectations formation. Brazil is part of an important group of developing countries (BRIC — Brazil, Russia, India and China) and represents a potential laboratory experiment in which the effects of an adoption of inflation targeting after more than a decade can be evaluated. Not enough is known about the consequences of inflation targeting credibility on both monetary policy and monetary policy transmission channels in developing countries that adopted inflation targeting. Hence, the paper analyzes the effects of credibility on the conduct of monetary policy, and the transmission channels through which monetary policy affect the economy. The study found that inflation targeting has represented an important strategy for the achievement of a more stable macroeconomic environment, which has been of great importance to investments and employment creation. Besides, the study found the following novelties: inflation targeting credibility positively affects entrepreneurs' expectations, expectations of entrepreneurs affect investment decisions and employment creation and the expectations of entrepreneurs are affected by the traditional transmission channels.

T2  - International Finance
AB  - Inflation targeting has been widely adopted in both developed and emerging economies. In this essay, I survey the evidence on the effects of inflation targeting on macroeconomic performance and assess what lessons this evidence provides for inflation targeting and the design of monetary policy. While macroeconomic experiences among both inflation targeting and non-targeting developed economies have been similar, inflation targeting has improved macroeconomic performance among developing economies. Importantly, inflation targeting has not been associated with greater real economic instability among either developed or developing economics. While cost shocks, such as the large rise in commodity prices that occurred in 2007 and early 2008, force central banks to make difficult short-run trade-offs, the ability to deal with demand shocks and financial crises can be enhanced by a commitment to an explicit target.

AU  - Gamber, Edward N.

AB  - We hypothesize that if monetary policy is important in explaining movements in output and inflation then it should follow that more accurate forecasts of monetary policy, on average, will tend to produce more accurate forecasts of growth and inflation. Using data from the Survey of Professional Forecasters we find that improved monetary policy forecast accuracy corresponds to lower variance of forecast errors for growth and inflation but very little reduction in the overall average size of forecast errors for growth and inflation.

TI  - Does inflation targeting matter?
AU  - Neumann, Manfred J. M.
AU  - von Hagen, Jürgen
AB  - This paper studies the inflation and interest rate performances since the late 1970s for six former highinflation
countries that adopted inflation targeting (IT) in the early 1990’s. Using Germany, Switzerland
and the US for comparison, we look at various aspects of central bank performance in a pre-IT period
(1978-92) and a post-IT period (1993-01). The results of all types of evidence considered uniformly lead
to the general conclusion that IT has proven a useful strategy for reducing the level and volatility of
inflation. However, IT central banks did not outperform the central banks used as reference cases during
the second period. We then present an event study of monetary policy comparing inflation and interest
rate developments after the 1978 and the 1998 oil price shocks. Here we find that IT central banks
realized significantly larger gains in credibility than the central banks in the reference group. . This result
corroborates the conclusion that IT is a useful framework for communicating a monetary policy strategy
aiming at low inflation rates.

AB  - We examine the evidence that expected security returns can be forecasted by the term premium, default premium, and dividend yield, in light of recent findings that similar security return patterns are associated with Federal Reserve monetary policy developments. We extend Fama and French's (1989) analysis by suggesting that the monetary environment influences investors' required returns, and hence the robustness of the models they propose. Our findings indicate that Fama and French's results vary dramatically across monetary environments; that is, the behavior of the business-conditions proxies and their influence on expected security returns is significantly affected by the monetary sector.

AU  - Chari, V. V.
T2  - Journal of Money, Credit &amp; Banking
AB  - his paper addresses an important question regarding the conduct of monetary policy. How should central banks use private forecasts of such target variables as inflation in setting policy instruments like short-term interest rates. The answer is: With great caution. Several authors including Goodfriend (1993), Hall and Mankiw (1994), and Hetzel (1990 and 1992) have proposed that measures of private-sector forecasts be used in the conduct of monetary policy. Two arguments have been made in support of these proposals. First, private agents may have information about variables that affect the economy which the central bank could use in making its decisions. Second, private agents may be able to detect deviations from policy rules that depend explicitly upon market prices and this could ensure that the central bank is held sharply accountable for its decisions. For example, asset market...

AB  - The lag in effect of monetary policy contains vital information for the policy evaluation. Allowing for a time-varying treatment effect, we show that Inflation Targeting (IT) effectively lowers inflation for both developed and developing countries. Developed countries reach their targets rapidly with a 2-year lag in effect. Developing countries, however, reduce inflation gradually towards their targets and do not reach their ultimate goal by the end year of 2007.

TI  - Disentangling the effects of multidimensional monetary policy on inflation and inflation expectations in the euro area
AU  - Martínez-Hernández, Catalina
AB  - The European Central Bank (ECB) has adopted a mixture of conventional and unconventional tools in order to achieve its mandate of price stability in the current low-inflation, low-interest-rate scenario. This paper contributes to the existing literature by providing a taxonomy of the ECB's policy toolkit and by evaluating its implications on price stability and the anchoring of inflation expectations. I carry out my analysis based on a high-frequency identification and the estimation of a large Bayesian Vector Autoregression. I find evidence of re-anchored expectations as response to quantitative easing and forward guidance, i.e. forecasters revise their long-run expectations upwards. Consequently, inflation increases, which stresses the crucial role of expectations for the transmission of monetary policy.

T2  - Journal of Monetary Economics
AB  - We formulate an optimizing-agent model in which both labor and product markets exhibit monopolistic competition and staggered nominal contracts. The unconditional expectation of average household utility can be expressed in terms of the unconditional variances of the output gap, price inflation, and wage inflation. Monetary policy cannot achieve the Pareto-optimal equilibrium that would occur under completely flexible wages and prices; that is, the model exhibits a tradeoff in stabilizing the output gap, price inflation, and wage inflation. We characterize the optimal policy rule for reasonable calibrations of the model. We also find that strict price inflation targeting generates relatively large welfare losses, whereas several other simple policy rules perform nearly as well as the optimal rule.

AU  - Thorbecke, Willem

T2  - Southern Economic Journal
AB  - Romer and Romer (2000) reported that federal funds rate increases may raise expected inflation by revealing the Federal Reserve's private information about inflation. Gürkaynak, Sack, and Swanson (2005a) presented evidence that funds rate increases lowered long-term expected inflation. To choose between these hypotheses, we examine how monetary policy surprises affect daily traded commodity prices, term interest rates, and forward interest rates. We find that funds rate increases in the 1970s raised gold and silver prices and that increases after 1989 lowered gold and silver prices. We also find that funds rate hikes over both sample periods primarily affected short-term interest rates and near-term forward rates. For the 1970s, these results suggest that Romer and Romer's explanation is correct. For recent years, they indicate that funds rate increases affect real rates and may also be consistent with the findings of Gürkaynak, Sack, and Swanson.

TI  - Oil prices, inflation expectations and monetary policy
T2  - Discussion Paper ; 09/2015
A3  - Sussman, Nathan
A3  - Zohar, Osnat
AB  - The sharp declines in oil prices starting in late 2014 sparked a debate about their effect on inflation and the world economy (e.g. GEP January 2015). The decline in oil prices lowered inflation in the short run and in some cases pushed some economies that already experience very low inflation into deflation. More surprisingly, data from the US, Euro area, UK and Israel shows that oil prices have a strong correlation with inflation expectations for the medium term, as measured by five-year breakeven inflation rates. Before the global financial crisis this correlation was weaker and expectations were firmly anchored at the 2% level. However, from the onset of the global crisis, the correlation is quite high (Table 1 and Figure 1). In this note we decompose the change in oil prices to global demand and supply shocks. Using this decomposition we show that following the onset of the crisis inflation expectations reacted quite strongly to global demand conditions and oil supply shocks. These findings suggest that the public’s belief in the ability of monetary authorities to stabilize inflation at the medium term horizon has deteriorated. This could be due to A. greater emphasis put by monetary authorities on stabilizing economic activity as opposed to stabilizing inflation. B. Asymmetric behavior of central banks with respect to negative deviations from the inflation target. C. The public’s perception about the effectiveness of monetary policy around the zero lower bound

TI  - Monetary Policy Neglect and the Great Inflation in Canada, Australia, and New Zealand
AU  - Nelson, Edward
AB  - This paper studies the Great Inflation in Canada, Australia, and New Zealand. Newspaper coverage and policymakers' statements are used to analyze the views on the inflation process that led to the 1970s macroeconomic policies, and the different movement in each country away from 1970s views. I argue that to understand the course of policy in each country, it is crucial to use the monetary policy neglect hypothesis, which claims that the Great Inflation occurred because policymakers delegated inflation control to nonmonetary devices. This hypothesis helps explain why, unlike Canada, Australia and New Zealand continued to suffer high inflation in the mid-1980s. The delayed disinflation in these countries reflected the continuing importance accorded to nonmonetary views of inflation.

The stability of the results for the effect of money on RI is evaluated when nominal interest rates are considered. Also, the stability of the results for the effect of nominal interest rates on RI is evaluated when real rates, anticipated inflation and financial deregulation are considered.The second objective is to consider the implications of these results for the recent theories regarding the limited efficacy of monetary policy and the lack of causality from interest rates to fluctuations in real economic activity (e.g. Sims'' theory of post-war business cycles and the Fama-Litterman-Weiss hypothesis). This is a unique way of examining these theories because it involves an economic aggregate (RI) that generally makes cyclical turns prior to those of the overall business cycle. The hypotheses were originally formulated and tested using aggregates or indices that coincide with or lag the general business cycle. A ''leading'' series may be important to examine in these cases, as it may directly be affected by monetary policy or interest rates and also act directly as an impulse mechanism for GNP.Sims'' conclusions about the behavior of money in the business cycle cannot be challenged with these results. The Fama-Litterman-Weiss hypothesis, however, with respect to RI is rejected. Nominal interest rates are found strongly ''causally'' prior to RI. The rate of interest remains ''causally'' prior to RI in the era after financial deregulation (albeit with a slightly smaller effect). RI is also shown strongly ''causally'' prior to GNP. This research helps reestablish a link between nominal interest rates and real economic activity.
