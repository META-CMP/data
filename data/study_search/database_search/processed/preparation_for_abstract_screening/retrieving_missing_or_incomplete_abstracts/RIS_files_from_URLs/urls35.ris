AB  - This article investigates the relationship between inflation and inflation uncertainty, and the impact of monetary policy on this relationship using monthly Turkish inflation data over January 1984 to–October 2005. The results from various types of GARCH-M models indicate that higher inflation rates lead to greater inflation uncertainty. On the other hand, the effect of inflation uncertainty on inflation is found to be negative due to stabilization motives’ dominating the opportunistic incentives of monetary authorities. We find strong evidence to support the view that inflation-oriented monetary policy has power to reduce the inflation persistence and eliminate uncertainty.

AB  - Ghana has been confronted with series of economic problems to the extent of calling on the IMF for a bailout after every eight years. This situation has persisted in spite of various monetary authority stabilization policies. This paper therefore focuses on investigating the games of monetary policy, inflation and economic growth of the Ghanaian economy for the period of 1982-2017. Using Autoregressive Distributed Lag (ARDL) to cointegration model, it was revealed from the study that in the long run interest rate significantly influences economic growth but in a negative direction, implies that a higher interest rate has the tendency to restrained economic growth and inflationary pressures. In relation to exchange rate, the long run result indicates an insignificant negative effect on economic growth. The general results suggest that macroeconomic variable which influences economic growth is interest rate and exchange rate. This is evidence that macroeconomic instabilities have significant effect on economic growth. This therefore calls for fiscal discipline and autonomy power to the Bank of Ghana with less interreference from the government to enable the smooth implementation of monetary policies without any string of politics attached.

AU  - Hardouvelis, Gikas A.
T2  - Journal of Economic Dynamics and Control
AB  - When a country's central bank has higher output objectives than those of wage-setters, the noncooperative Nash equilibrium contains an inflationary bias, which is higher, the flatter the economy's aggregate supply curve. An economy's openness from the input side is an exogenous observable characteristic that provides a direct way of testing the theory. When the imported intermediate goods displace capital (labor) in production, a higher degree of openness flattens (steepens) the economy's aggregate supply curve and increases (decreases) the inflationary bias.

AB  - Working with a small-scale calibrated New-Keynesian model, Coibion and Gorodnichenko (2011) find that the reduction in trend inflation during Volcker's mandate was a key factor behind the Great Moderation. We revisit this finding with an estimated New-Keynesian model with trend inflation and no indexation based on Christiano, Eichenbaum and Evans (2005). First, our simulations confirm Coibion and Gorodnichenko's (2011) main finding. Second, we show that a trend inflation-immune Taylor rule based on economic theory can avoid indeterminacy even at high levels of trend inflation such as those observed in the 1970s.

TI  - Does Monetary Policy Play Effective Role in Controlling Inflation in Pakistan
AU  - Qayyum, Abdul
AB  - This paper presented the salient features of current Monetary Policy and its effectiveness to control inflation in Pakistan. The monetary authority was successful in controlling inflation when it successfully controlled the money supply target. The calculation of money supply target needs to be improved to get appropriate target level of M2. It is also concluded that in the recent years SBP failed to control money supply and hence rate of inflation within the set target level. There seems to be a lack of coordination between Fiscal and Monetary Authorities. The understanding of issues regarding monetary policy transmission mechanism, effectiveness of different channels, lag structure of monetary policy changes, magnitude of pass-through of policy changes to inflation and output and nature of relationship amongst, instruments and goals of monetary policy (inflation and output) seems to be lacking and need fresh investigation.

AB  - This paper studies the conduct and performance of monetary policy in five West and Central African countries: Cameroon, Côte d'Ivoire, Gabon, Ghana and Nigeria. The first three are members of the CFA Zone and maintain a fixed peg vis-à-vis the French franc. The other two have recently opted for a more flexible exchange rate regime. No general conclusion can be drawn on the monetary policy-exchange rate policy nexus. Estimates of the offset coefficient are significantly different from (negative) one but VAR estimation results on the ability of the monetary authority to pursue an independent inflation target are mixed. The monetary authorities of Ghana and Nigeria sterilize the accumulation of net foreign assets to a limited degree; no such evidence exists for CFA Zone members.

T2  - European Journal of Political Economy
AB  - Interest-rate and exchange-rate dynamics is studied in a game between the monetary and fiscal policymakers where the monetary policymaker targets inflation. In the Nash game, a conflict over the appropriate size of the output gap leads to excessive interest-rate and exchange-rate volatility. For this reason, there are benefits in restricting fiscal policymaking. If the fiscal policymaker, however, is considered to have a first-mover advantage, the fiscal policymaker will internalise its effect on monetary policy, and the conflict is resolved and interest-rate and exchange-rate volatility is reduced.

AB  - This paper uses the open economy structural VAR model developed in Buckle, Kim, Kirkham, McLellan and Sharma (2002) to evaluate the impact of monetary policy on New Zealand business cycles and inflation variability and the output/ inflation variance trade-off. The model includes a forward- looking Taylor Rule to identify monetary policy and the impact of monetary policy is evaluated by deriving a monetary policy index using a procedure suggested by Dungey and Pagan (2000). Monetary policy has generally been counter-cyclical, thereby reducing business cycles and inflation variability. Exceptions are in 1993 when monetary policy accentuated the business cycle upswing and in 1998 when monetary policy accentuated the recession, although its impact in 1998 was small relative to the impact of adverse climatic conditions. During the initial years of inflation targeting monetary policy tended to simultaneously reduce inflation and output variability. From 1996 to 2001 monetary policy was less effective in reducing inflation and output variability. This latter period included a brief experiment with a Monetary Conditions Index, the Asian crisis and a large adverse domestic climate shock.

AB  - Since the early 1990s, a number of countries have adopted Inflation Targeting (IT) in an effort to reduce inflation. Most literature has praised IT as a superior framework of monetary policy. We suggest that IT is a major policy prescription closely associated with the New Consensus Macroeconomics (NCM). Focusing mainly on the IT aspects of the NCM, we address and assess the theoretical foundations of IT, and then assess the empirical work on IT, distinguishing between work that utilizes structural macroeconomic models and work based on single-equation techniques. The IT theoretical framework and the available empirical evidence do not appear to support the views of IT proponents.

T2  - Journal of Economic Dynamics and Control
AB  - We describe a simple mechanism that generates inflation persistence in a standard sticky-price model of optimal fiscal and monetary policy. Key to this mechanism is that policies are implemented under discretion. The government's discretionary incentive to erode the real value of nominal public debt by means of surprise inflation renders inflation expectations and, in further consequence, equilibrium inflation rates highly correlated with the stock of public debt. Debt, in turn, is highly persistent, allowing for tax-smoothing in the face of disturbances. Due to the aforementioned correlation, the persistence in debt carries over to inflation. Our analysis uncovers a non-monotonic effect of nominal rigidities on inflation persistence and shows that government debt under discretion does not display the near random walk property familiar from the Ramsey literature. A calibrated version of the model that incorporates a moderate degree of monopolistic competition and price stickiness is quantitatively consistent with the inflation dynamics experienced in the USA since the Volcker disinflation of the early 1980s.

AU  - Montes, Gabriel Caldas

T2  - Journal of Economic Studies
AB  - Purpose The evidence concerning the effects of the inflation targeting (IT) regime as well as greater central bank transparency on monetary policy interest rates is not conclusive, and the following questions remain open. What is the effect of adopting IT on both the level and volatility of monetary policy interest rate? Does central bank transparency affect the level of the monetary policy interest rate and its volatility? Are these effects greater in developing countries? The purpose of this paper is to contribute to the literature by answering these questions. Hence, the paper analyzes the effects of IT and central bank transparency on monetary policy. Design/methodology/approach The analysis uses a sample of 48 countries (31 developing) comprising the period between 1998 and 2014. Based on panel data methodology, estimates are made for the full sample, and then for the sample of developing countries. Findings Countries that adopt the IT regime tend to have lower levels of monetary policy interest rates, as well as lower interest rate volatility. The effect of adopting IT on both the level and volatility of the basic interest rate is smaller in developing countries. Besides, countries with more transparent central banks have lower levels of monetary policy interest rates, as well as lower interest rate volatility. In turn, the effect of central bank transparency on both the level and volatility of the basic interest rate is greater in developing countries. Practical implications The study brings important practical implications regarding the influence of both the IT regime and central bank transparency on monetary policy. Originality/value Studies have sought to analyze whether IT and central bank transparency are effective to control inflation. However, few studies analyze the influence of IT and central bank transparency on interest rates. This study differs from the few existing studies since: the analysis is done not only for the effect of transparency on the level of the monetary policy interest rate, but also on its volatility; the central bank transparency index that is used has never been utilized in this sort of analysis; and the study uses panel data methodology, and compares the results between different samples.

T2  - Occasional Papers
AB  - Faced with a very prolonged period of low inflation, the Bank of Japan has been modifying its monetary policy strategy over the last two decades, pioneering the use of non-standard measures: it reduced policy interest rates to zero and, more recently, to negative levels, and has implemented several asset purchase programmes, forward guidance and, in September 2016, a yield curve control policy. Despite all these efforts, Japan has continued to experience persistently low inflation, with rates well below the central bank’s target in recent decades. This document analyses the changes in the Bank of Japan’s strategy in its struggle against low inflation, focusing in particular on the reasons that led it to adopt the interest rate control policy, describes how this policy works and its main features, and assesses the results obtained. This new strategy has allowed the Bank of Japan to control the yield curve more effectively and sustainably, reducing the volume of asset purchases and mitigating the potential adverse financial stability effects. However, empirical analysis shows that it has still not succeeded in modifying the adaptive and persistent nature of the process of formation of prices and inflation expectations in Japan.

AU  - Kahn, George A.

T2  - Handbook of Monetary Policy
AB  - This chapter examines how central banks have changed their policy procedures after adopting explicit inflation targets. The targets are intended to help central banks achieve and maintain price stability by specifying an explicit goal for monetary policy based on a given time path for a particular measure of inflation. In some cases the targets are expressed as a range for inflation over time, while in other cases they are expressed as a path for the inflation rate itself. Central banks have adopted inflation targets as a strategy for achieving, and then maintaining, price stability. Inflation targeting regimes share several common features. Inflation targets can be set by the government, jointly agreed upon by the central bank and the government, or set by the central bank itself. The ultimate rationale for targets is to help the central bank achieve a desired long-run level of inflation, usually a measured rate of inflation consistent with “price stability.”.

These include higher risk premia, hedging costs and unforeseen redistribution of wealth. This paper presents panel estimations for a sample of OECD countries which suggest that activist fiscal policies may have an important impact on CPI inflation volatility. Major results are robust for unconditional and conditional inflation volatility, the latter derived from country-specific GARCH models, and across different data frequencies, time periods and econometric methodologies.

AB  - This paper examines the way in which structural changes in the level of steady-state competitiveness and the trend rate of inflation affect inflation responses to monetary policy shocks, in scenarios chosen to capture broadly the conditions of the UK economy in the early 1990s and more recently. Cyclical changes in competitiveness are also considered, since it is not clear empirically whether changes in competitiveness have been predominantly structural or cyclical. A model based on work by Woodford is used, allowing for positive trend inflation and cyclical variations in competitiveness in a tractable manner. This extension enables the separate quantification of the impact of differences in the steady-state level of and cyclical changes in competitiveness on inflation in the short term, in high and low inflation environments. The paper quantifies the extent to which procyclical (countercyclical) changes in competitiveness dampen (amplify) the impulse responses of inflation to a given monetary policy shock. In the calibration used, the inflation response to monetary policy shocks in a low inflation/high competitiveness environment is dampened compared with a high inflation/low competitiveness environment. By contrast, inflation responses to monetary policy shocks in a low inflation/low competitiveness environment are similar to those in a high inflation/high competitiveness environment.

T3  - Special Issue on Monetary and Fiscal Interactions in Times of Economic Stress
AB  - We use a rational expectations framework to assess the implications of rising debt in an environment with a “fiscal limit”. The fiscal limit is defined as the point where the government no longer has the ability to finance higher debt levels by increasing taxes, so either an adjustment to fiscal spending or monetary policy must occur to stabilize debt. We give households a joint probability distribution over the various policy adjustments that may occur, as well as over the timing of when the fiscal limit is hit. One policy option that stabilizes debt is a passive monetary policy, which generates a burst of inflation that devalues the existing nominal debt stock. The probability of this outcome places upward pressure on inflation expectations and poses a substantial challenge to a central bank pursuing an inflation target. The distribution of outcomes for the path of future inflation has a fat right tail, revealing that only a small set of outcomes imply dire inflationary scenarios. Avoiding these scenarios, however, requires the fiscal authority to renege on some share of future promised transfers.

AB  - We explore the implications of current account adjustment for monetary policy within a simple two-country DSGE model. Our framework nests Obstfeld and Rogoff's (2005) static model of exchange rate responsiveness to current account reversals. It extends this approach by endogenizing the dynamic adjustment path and by incorporating production and nominal price rigidities in order to study the role of monetary policy. We consider two different adjustment scenarios. The first is a "slow burn" where the adjustment of the current account deficit of the home country is smooth and slow. The second is a "fast burn" where, owing to a sudden shift in expectations of relative growth rates, there is a rapid reversal of the home country's current account. We examine several different monetary policy regimes under each of these scenarios. Our principal finding is that the behavior of the domestic variables (for instance, output, inflation) is quite sensitive to the monetary regime, while the behavior of the international variables (for instance, the current account and the real exchange rate) is less so. Among different policy rules, domestic inflation targeting achieves the best stabilization outcome of aggregate variables. This result is robust to the presence of imperfect pass-through on import prices, although in this case stabilization of consumer price inflation performs similarly well.

TI  - Inflation targeting in India: issues and prospects
AU  - Jha, Raghbendra
T2  - International Review of Applied Economics
AB  - This paper evaluates the case for inflation targeting (IT) in India. It states the objectives of monetary policy in India and argues that, with widespread poverty still present, inflation control cannot be an exclusive concern of monetary policy. The rationale for IT is spelt out and found to be incomplete. The paper provides some evidence on the effects of IT in developed and transition economies and argues that although IT may have been responsible for maintaining a low inflation regime, it has not brought down the inflation rate itself substantially and or changed the volatility of the exchange rate. Output movements in transition countries adopting IT have been higher than in developed market economies. I discuss India’s experience with using nominal targets for monetary policy and why India is not ready for IT. Further, even if India’s central bank wanted to, it could not pursue IT because the short‐term interest rate does not have a significant effect on inflation. The paper concludes by listing monetary policy options for India.

AU  - Romer, Christina D.
AU  - Romer, David H.
AB  - While there is ample evidence that high inflation is harmful, little is known about how best to reduce inflation or how far it should be reduced. In this volume, sixteen distinguished economists analyze the appropriateness of low inflation as a goal for monetary policy and discuss possible strategies for reducing inflation.  Section I discusses the consequences of inflation. These papers analyze inflation's impact on the tax system, labor market flexibility, equilibrium unemployment, and the public's sense of well-being. Section II considers the obstacles facing central bankers in achieving low inflation. These papers study the precision of estimates of equilibrium unemployment, the sources of the high inflation of the 1970s, and the use of non-traditional indicators in policy formation. The papers in section III consider how institutions can be designed to promote successful monetary policy, and the importance of institutions to the performance of policy in the United States, Germany, and other countries.  This timely volume should be read by anyone who studies or conducts monetary policy.

TI  - Stock Returns and Inflation Redux: An Explanation from Monetary Policy in Advanced and Emerging Markets
AU  - Zhang, Mr Zhongxia
AB  - Classical theories of monetary economics predict that real stock returns are negatively correlated with inflation when monetary policy is countercyclical. Previous empirical studies mostly focus on a small group of developed countries or a few countries with hyperinflation. In this paper, I examine the stock return-inflation relation under different monetary policy regimes and conditions using an expanded dataset of 71 economies. Empirical evidence suggests that the stock return-inflation relation is partially driven by monetary policy. If a country’s monetary authority conducts a more countercyclical monetary policy, the stock return-inflation relation becomes more negative. In addition, the results differ by monetary policy framework. In exchange rate anchor countries, stock markets do not respond to monetary policy cyclicality. In inflation targeting countries, stock markets react more strongly to inflation. A key contribution of this paper is to classify inflation targeters by their behaviors, and illustrate that behavior matters in shaping market perceptions: markets react to inflation and monetary policy cyclicality when central banks are able to control inflation within their target bands. In this case markets are sensitive to inflation dynamics when inflation is above the announced target bands. Finally, when monetary policy is constrained by the Zero Lower Bound (ZLB), a structural break is introduced and real stock returns no longer respond to inflation and monetary policy cyclicality.

TI  - Using Monetary Policy Rules in Emerging Market Economies
AU  - Taylor, John B
AB  - This paper shows that the use of monetary policy rules in emerging market economies has many of the same benefits that have been found in research and in practice in developed economies. For those emerging market economies that do not choose a policy of “permanently” fixing the exchange rate—perhaps through a currency board or dollarization, the only sound monetary policy is one based on the trinity of a flexible exchange rate, an inflation target, and a monetary policy rule. However, market conditions in emerging market economies may require modifications of the typical policy rule that has been recommended for economies with more developed financial markets.

AU  - Yunana, Titus Wuyah
T2  - European Journal of Business and Management
AB  - The paper examines the Impact of Monetary Policy on Inflationary Process in Nigeria from 1986 – 2013, using ordinary least squared regression. We started with investigating the stochastic properties of the data using the Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) and Phillips-Perron (PP) tests for unit roots. Both tests suggest that all the variables of interest which comprise of inflation rate, Money supply, interest rate and Unemployment are integrated at the second difference. The regression results showed that monetary policy have significant influence on inflation. It is recommended that the government should embark on joint coordination of fiscal and monetary authorities with respect to liquidity flows in the economy to aid curb inflation. Furthermore, where deficit financing is inevitable, it should be put into productive activities in order to create more employment opportunities, raise national output, and increase the living standard of the people.

T2  - African Development Review
AB  - The central bank of Ghana (BoG) has operated monetary aggregates targeting and inflation targeting since the 1980s, to ensure enhanced output growth, low unemployment and stable, low inflation. Under inflation targeting, the inflation rate averaged 13.26 per cent per annum between 2007 and 2015, compared with 29.22 per cent per annum under monetary aggregates targeting. The relatively lower inflation rates notwithstanding, an average inflation rate of 13.2 per cent per annum is far above the medium-term target of 8 per cent. This paper has examined the effectiveness of monetary aggregates targeting and inflation targeting in keeping inflation at moderate levels. The autoregressive distributed lag (ARDL) model was applied to the data covering the period 1970–2015. The results show that monetary targeting has steered inflation to moderate levels only in the short run while inflation targeting has maintained low inflation rates in both short run and long run. But neither regime has kept inflation at stable levels and within the target band, due to the sluggish transmission of broad money supply and prime rate changes to inflation. We implore the monetary authorities to strengthen the institutional setup for steering short-term interest rates in Ghana. They should also enhance the BoG Act 2002 (Act 612), to develop secondary anchors and rules around output, money supply and fiscal deficit. Finally, the monetary policy committee should monetary policy credibility and transparency through strengthening its communication framework.

AB  - We estimate monetary policy surprises for European consumers over time, based on monetary policy changes that were unanticipated according to consumers’ stated beliefs. We find that such monetary policy surprises have the opposite impact on inflation expectations from the impact found when assuming that consumers are well informed. Relaxing the latter assumption by focusing on consumers’ stated beliefs, unanticipated increases in the interest rate raise inflation expectations before the 2008 financial crisis. This is consistent with imperfect information theoretical settings where interest rate hikes are interpreted as positive news about the state of the economy by consumers who know that policymakers have relatively more information.

AB  - This paper investigates the evolution of inflation dynamics in the five largest ASEAN countries between 1997 and 2017. To account for changes in the monetary policy frameworks since the Asian Financial Crisis (AFC), the analysis is based on country-specific Phillips curves allowing for time-varying parameters. The paper finds evidence of a higher degree of forward-looking dynamics and a better anchoring of inflation expectations, consistent with the improvements in monetary policy frameworks in the region. In contrast, the quantitative impact of cyclical fluctuations and import prices has gradually diminished over time.

Financial stability must not be considered as a simple goal of monetary policy, but a precondition for central banks operate their policies and reach the goals of inflation and output stability. The work identifies different sources of uncertainties that surround central banks' decisions; and approaches the role that inflation targeting central banks should play according to some basic principles that can serve as useful guides for central banks to help them achieve successful outcomes in their conduct of monetary policy.

AB  - Inflation targeting (IT) serves as monetary policy framework in several advanced economies, where it has enhanced policy transparency and accountability. The paper considers its wider applicability to developing countries. The prerequisites for a successful IT framework are identified as an ability to carry out an independent monetary policy (free of fiscal dominance or commitment to another nominal anchor, like the exchange rate) and a quantitative framework linking policy instruments to inflation. These prerequisites are largely absent among developing countries, though several of them could with some further institutional changes and an overriding commitment to low inflation make use of an IT framework.

AB  - Historical data and model simulations support the following conclusion. Inflation is low during stock market booms, so that an interest rate rule that is too narrowly focused on inflation destabilizes asset markets and the broader economy. Adjustments to the interest rate rule can remove this source of welfare-reducing instability. For example, allowing an independent role for credit growth (beyond its role in constructing the inflation forecast) would reduce the volatility of output and asset prices.

AB  - This chapter investigates the implications of adaptive learning in the private sector's formation of inflation expectations for the conduct of monetary policy. We first review the literature that studies the implications of adaptive learning processes for macroeconomic dynamics under various monetary policy rules. We then analyze optimal monetary policy in the standard New Keynesian model, when the central bank minimizes an explicit loss function and has full information about the structure of the economy, including the precise mechanism generating private sector's expectations. The focus on optimal policy allows us to investigate how and to what extent a change in the assumption of how agents form their inflation expectations affects the principles of optimal monetary policy. It also provides a benchmark to evaluate simple policy rules. We find that departures from rational expectations increase the potential for instability in the economy, strengthening the importance of anchoring inflation expectations. We also find that the simple commitment rule under rational expectations is robust when expectations are formed in line with adaptive learning.

AB  - Inflation targeting is a monetary-policy strategy characterized by an announced numerical inflation target, an implementation of monetary policy that gives a major role to an inflation forecast that has been called forecast targeting, and a high degree of transparency and accountability. It was introduced in New Zealand in 1990, has been very successful in terms of stabilizing both inflation and the real economy, and as of 2010 has been adopted by about 25 industrialized and emerging-market economies. This chapter discusses the history, macroeconomic effects, theory, practice, and future of inflation targeting.

AU  - Taylor, John B.
AB  - Since the mid-1980s, monetary policy has contributed to a great moderation of the housing cycle by responding more proactively to inflation and thereby reducing the boom bust cycle. However, during the period from 2002 to 2005, the short term interest rate path deviated significantly from what this two decade experience would suggest is appropriate. A counterfactual simulation with a simple model of the housing market shows that this deviation may have been a cause of the boom and bust in housing starts and inflation in the last two years. Moreover, a significant time series correlation between housing price inflation and delinquency rates suggests that the poor credit assessments on subprime mortgages may also have been caused by this deviation.

TI  - The effects of inflation targeting on macroeconomic performance
AU  - Pétursson, Thórarinn G
AB  - An increasing number of countries have adopted inflation targeting since New Zealand first adopted this framework in early 1990. Currently there are 21 countries using inflation targeting in every continent of the world. This paper discusses the economic effects of inflation targeting. The main conclusion is that inflation targeting has largely been a success. The new framework has made central banks, which previously lacked credibility, able to change the way they do monetary policy towards what is commonly considered best practice. In many respects they have even been leading in creating a new benchmark for how to formulate monetary policy.

AB  - With quarterly data from Israel and Turkey we estimate generalized impulse response functions to show that inflation has no long-run real effects on consumption, investment and the current account balance. The findings are robust even after allowing for inflation volatility obtained through GARCH estimates. We develop an inter-temporal optimizing model of a small open economy with a fixed rate of time preference that supports the empirics. Our model, thus, extends the super-neutrality results (à la Sidrausky) in an open economy paradigm. Copyright © 2007 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

T2  - Journal of Money, Credit and Banking
AB  - As the world economy recovers from the worst financial crisis and most severe global slump in 75 years, policymakers, regulators, and academics are focusing intensely and appropriately on lessons to be learned for monetary policy. There are certainly many questions to answer. Among the most important are: Are inflation expectations “well anchored”? What, if any, influence should asset quantities and prices have on monetary policy? Do we have sufficient confidence in our alternative monetary policy tools to stabilize the economy at the zero lower bound?

TI  - The Nonlinear Phillips Curve and Inflation Forecast Targeting: Symmetric versus Asymmetric Monetary Policy Rules
AU  - Schaling, Eric
T2  - Journal of Money, Credit and Banking
AB  - We study a simple, small dynamic economy that a policymaker is attempting to control via use of a monetary policy rule. The model features a convex Phillips curve, in that positive deviations of aggregate demand from potential are more inflationary than negative deviations are disinflationary. Using dynamic optimization techniques, we find that the form of the optimal monetary policy reaction function is asymmetric. We show that in the optimal rule the interest rate is a nonlinear function of the deviation of inflation from its target and of output from potential. With asymmetry, optimal monetary policy becomes more active as uncertainty about the impact of policy increases. We thus provide an important and novel theoretical reason why increased uncertainty can lead to more aggressive rather than toward more cautious optimal policies.

AB  - This report uses international comparisons to understand U.S. inflation dynamics since 1960. We decompose each G-7 country’s inflation path into a time-varying trend plus a transitory component, each with time-varying volatility. The level and volatility of trend inflation display coincident hump-shaped patterns that allow us to date the start of the Great Inflation in the late 1960s and a synchronized Inflation Stabilization in the mid 1980s. This temporal clustering narrows the set of G-7-wide economic developments which could have triggered the excessive monetary policy accommodation that was the ultimate source of the Great Inflation. We present evidence suggesting that the most likely explanation is a change in monetary regime. Another robust feature of the data is that changes in inflation are negatively serially correlated. Conventional versions of a workhorse macroeconomic model regularly used by central banks cannot account for this pattern. Finally, we show that several survey measures of inflation expectations help forecast the estimated trend of U.S. core CPI inflation, and that the trend also influences these survey measures over time.

AB  - The purpose of this research was to analyze the effect of monetary policy on gross domestic product and inflation via house price index as a proxy for other assets in Iran in 1989-2008. For the analysis time series data and vector error correlation method were used. The results showed that in the pattern 1 the positive monetary shocks in the short run increased the product and decreased the prices but, in the long run it decreased the product and increased the prices. The debt shocks of the banks to the central bank in the short run had little effect on the product and the prices. In the intermediate run these shocks had decreased the product and increased the prices. And in the long run it increased the product and decreased the prices. In pattern 2 positive shock of the legal deposits ratio leads to decrease in the production and increase in the inflation in the short, intermediate and the long run, through the banking lending. Results shoed also that money policy instruments (banks loan to the central bank and the rate of legal deposits) had a little effect on the granted facilities of the banks.

TI  - Exchange Rate Pass-Through and the Inflation Environment in Industrialized Countries: An Empirical Investigation
AU  - Bailliu, Jeannine
AU  - Fujii, Eiji
AB  - This paper investigates the question of whether a transition to a low-inflation environment, induced by a shift in monetary policy, results in a decline in the degree of pass-through of exchange rate movements to consumer prices. It differs from previous empirical work in its focus on the identification of changes in the inflation environment and its use of a panel-data approach. Evidence from a panel-data set of 11 industrialized countries over the period from 1977 to 2001 supports the hypothesis that exchange rate pass-through declines with a shift to a low-inflation environment brought about by a change in the monetary policy regime. More specifically, the results suggest that pass-through to import, producer, and consumer price inflation declined following the inflation stabilization that occurred in many industrialized countries in the early 1990s but did not decline following a similar episode in the 1980s. Several potential explanations for this finding are discussed, including the possibility that changes in the monetary policy regimes implemented in the 1990s were perceived as more credible than those carried out in the 1980s, and the possibility that the credibility of the new monetary policy regimes was acquired over time.

AU  - Walsh, Carl E
AB  - Similarities between the 1960s and 70s raise concerns that central banks are repeating mistakes that led to the Great In‡ation. Two explanations for this earlier period of in‡ation, that it was due to shocks and special factors or that it was the result of political pressures on monetary policy, seem particularly relevant today. Major central banks such as the Federal Reserve and the ECB have been slow to react to the surge in in‡ation due to COVID-19 and the war in Ukraine. I investigate the consequences of policy delay and the impact of a more aggressive reaction, conditional on policy being delayed. In assessing the persistence of in‡ation shocks and in dealing with uncertainty about in‡ation dynamics, policymakers seem to be ignoring lessons from the literature on monetary policy in the face of model uncertainty.

AU  - Aryeetey, Ernest
AU  - Kanbur, S. M. Ravi
AB  - As Ghana approaches its 60th birthday, optimism and worries for the future continue to be present in equal measure. Economic growth in the last decade has been high by historical standards. Indeed, recent rebasing of GDP figures has put Ghana over the per capita income threshold into Middle Income Country status. However, structural transformation has lagged behind. Fiscal discipline has also eroded significantly and there is heavy borrowing, especially on the commercial market, while elements of the natural resource curse from oil have already occurred. The question most observers ask is whether the gains from two decades of reforms are being reversed. Given this background, this volume brings together leading established and young economists, from within and outside Ghana, to analyze and assess the challenges facing Ghana's economy as it enters its seventh decade and the nation heads towards three quarters of a century of independence.  The chapters cover the major macroeconomic and sectoral issues, including fiscal and monetary policy, trade and industrialization, agriculture and infrastructure. The volume also covers a full range of social issues including poverty and inequality, education, health, gender, and social protection. The book also examines the implications of the oil boom for Ghanaian development, and the role of institutions.

TI  - Monetary Policy, Income Inequality, and Inflation — What’s the Link?
AU  - Kronick, Jeremy
AU  - Villarreal, Francisco G.
AB  - This paper studies the link in Canada between monetary policy, income inequality, and inflation. What are the effects of monetary policy on income inequality? and why and how does inflation play a role? Income inequality largely increased from the time the Bank of Canada began targeting inflation, through the late 1990s to the early 2000s, and flattened or decreased after the 2008 financial crisis. On the whole, income inequality today is greater than it was when the Bank of Canada became an inflation-targeting central bank. Against this backdrop, our analysis shows that expansionary monetary policy shocks, triggered by a lower than expected bank rate, lead to increasing income inequality, while contractionary monetary policy shocks reduce income inequality. We then show that these effects are asymmetric with expansionary shocks having a greater impact on income inequality than contractionary shocks. Expansionary monetary policy shocks result in a higher share of national income shifting to higher income households, who consume less as a percentage of their income, dampening the increase in aggregate demand, and, therefore, inflation.Our results lead to one particularly important conclusion for monetary policy: namely, that the Bank of Canada needs to account for the impact of income inequality when modeling how inflation will respond to a change in the overnight rate.

We consider the consequences of such adjustments for the way policy would respond to a variety of disturbances, using the dynamic stochastic general equilibrium model with credit frictions developed in Cúrdia and Woodford (2009a). According to our model, an adjustment for variations in credit spreads can improve upon the standard Taylor rule, but the optimal size of adjustment depends on the source of the variation in credit spreads. A response to the quantity of credit is less likely to be helpful.

TI  - The Role of Seasonality and Monetary Policy in Inflation Forecasting
AU  - Kumah, Francis Y.
AB  - Adequate modeling of the seasonal structure of consumer prices is essential for inflation forecasting. This paper suggests a new econometric approach for jointly determining inflation forecasts and monetary policy stances, particularly where seasonal fluctuations of economic activity and prices are pronounced. In an application of the framework, the paper characterizes and investigates the stability of the seasonal pattern of consumer prices in the Kyrgyz Republic and estimates optimal money growth and implied exchange rate paths along with a jointly determined inflation forecast. The approach uses two broad specifications of an augmented error-correction model - with and without seasonal components. Findings from the paper confirm empirical superiority (in terms of information content and contributions to policymaking) of augmented error-correction models of inflation over single-equation, Box-Jenkins-type general autoregressive seasonal models. Simulations of the estimated error-correction models yield optimal monetary policy paths for achieving inflation targets and demonstrate the empirical significance of seasonality and monetary policy in inflation forecasting.

AB  - The focus of monetary policy has shifted markedly over the past 15 years away from attempts to fine tune the economy towards the longer-run goal of attaining price stability and creating the necessary conditions for sustainable economic growth. In an attempt to minimise the costs of such a transition, central banks have become more independent and monetary policy more transparent, changes intended to increase the credibility of monetary policy and to reduce short-run sacrifice ratios. However, concerns have been expressed that an environment of price stability and independent central banks may instead lead to higher sacrifice ratios and, perhaps, even higher rates of structural unemployment, because of the increased importance of nominal and real rigidities at low rates of inflation.

At first step, ARMA-GARCH model of monthly inflation data is estimated and the conditional variance from these estimates is indicated as the monthly inflation uncertainty series. Then, the Granger causality tests between primarily inflation and generated inflation uncertainty series are performed. Empirical results of our study provided strong evidence in favor of the Friedman-Ball hypothesis that inflationary period result in high inflation uncertainty in Turkish case. These results present significant implications for the relationship between inflation and inflation uncertainly in developing countries as much as monetary policy adopted Inflation Targeting in Turkey.

TI  - The Fed's Effect on Excess Returns and Inflation is Much Bigger than You Think
AU  - Goto, Shingo
AU  - Valkanov, Rossen I.
AB  - We find that between 20 and 25 percent of the negative covariance between excess returns and inflation is explained by shocks to monetary policy variables. The finding is robust to changes in the monetary policy rule that have occurred during the 1966-2000 period. The result contradicts the theory that money supply shocks induce a positive correlation between inflation and returns. Our findings also cast doubt on models that explain the negative correlation in a money-neutral environment (Boudoukh, Richardson, And Whitelaw (1994)), and on models that account for this correlation as being due solely to money demand shocks (Fama (1981), Marshall (1992)). We argue that contractionary monetary policy lowers excess stock market returns through various channels. Furthermore, if fed shocks raise the borrowing costs of firms or if the fed has some private information about future inflation, then a contractionary monetary shock will be followed by an increase in inflation, in the short run. The combined effect is a negative inflation/excess returns correlation. The results lend support to the argument that if asset pricing models are to capture the observed negative correlation, they must incorporate monetary policy effects.

AU  - Schmitt-Grohe, Stephanie
AU  - Uribe, Martin
AB  - This paper identifies optimal interest-rate rules within a rich, dynamic, general equilibrium model that has been shown to account well for observed aggregate dynamics in the postwar United States. We perform policy evaluations based on second-order accurate approximations to conditional and unconditional expected welfare. We require that interest-rate rules be operational, in the sense that they include as arguments only a few readily observable macroeconomic indicators and respect the zero bound on nominal interest rates. We find that the optimal operational monetary policy is a real-interest-rate targeting rule. That is, an interest-rate feedback rule featuring a unit inflation coefficient, a mute response to output, and no interest-rate smoothing. Contrary to existing studies, we find a significant degree of optimal inflation volatility. A key factor driving this result is the assumption of indexation to past inflation. Under indexation to long-run inflation the optimal inflation volatility is close to zero. Finally, we show that initial conditions matter for welfare rankings of policies.

This finding is at odds with standard macro-models based on sticky nominal prices, which imply that monetary policy cannot move real rates over a horizon longer than that over which all prices in the economy can readjust. Instead, the responsiveness of long-term real rates to monetary shocks appears to reflect changes in term premia. One mechanism that could generate such variation in term premia is based on demand effects due to the existence of what we call yield-oriented investors. We find some evidence supportive of this channel.

AB  - What caused the U.S. economy's shift from the Great Inflation era to the Great Moderation era? A large literature shows that the shift was achieved by the change in monetary policy from a passive to an active response to inflation. However, Coibion and Gorodnichenko (2011) attribute the shift to a fall in trend inflation along with the policy change, based on a solely estimated Taylor rule and a calibrated staggered-price model. We estimate the Taylor rule and the staggered-price model jointly and demonstrate that the change in monetary policy responses to inflation and other variables suffices for explaining the shift.

TI  - Monetary Policy, Bank Lending and Inflation in Nigeria: VAR Approach
AU  - Odior, E. S. O.
AB  - This paper investigates whether monetary policy (minimum rediscount rates, currency outside banks, net domestic credit, demand deposit and exchange rate) and commercial bank lending can provide a convincing explanation for monetary inflation in Nigeria, over the period 1980- 2010. The analyses are performed using data derived from the central bank statistical bulletin of Nigeria. This period was selected on account that it marks the beginning of indirect monetary policy regime in Nigeria. Applying the ADF to determine the stationary state of our data, the result shows that all the variables are not stationary at their level but at first difference. As such we apply the Vector Auto Regression (VAR) technique to determine the effects of monetary policy and bank lending on inflation. Therefore, a co-integration test was carried out to test the existence of a long run relationship in our data. Our findings show that monetary policy and bank lending rate do affect inflation partially. The paper also reveals that exchange rate has a little or negligible insignificantly effects on inflation. Therefore, the conclusion from our paper is that monetary policy and commercial bank lending inflation can provide partial explanation effects of inflation rate in Nigeria economy.

AU  - Modenesi, André de Melo

T2  - Investigación económica
AB  - With a view to offering a body of empirical evidence to assess the costs and benefits of Brazilian stabilization policy, we undertake an econometric analysis of the monetary policy transmission mechanism in Brazil during the period from the adoption of the inflation targeting regime (onwards ITR) to the subprime crisis (2000-2008). The exchange rate was the main channel of monetary policy transmission during that time frame. Furthermore, inflation sensitivity to the interest rate is low. Thus, a rise in the basic interest rate (Selic) generates relatively small benefits (a fall in inflation). However, an interest rate increase generates substantial costs: a slowdown in economic activity, the appreciation of the exchange rate, and an increase in public debt. Inflations low sensitivity to interest rates is seen as a result of problems in the transmission mechanism: a broken transmission mechanism reduces the efficiency of monetary policy. Price stability under ITR thus requires an excessively rigid monetary policy. The final outcome is, on the one hand, that inflation hardly gives in. 0n the other hand, the costs of high interest rates escalate. We conclude that the balance of costs and benefits of price stability under ITR is unfavorable.

AU  - Schmitt-Grohé, Stephanie

T2  - NBER Macroeconomics Annual
AB  - In this paper, we study Ramsey-optimal fiscal and monetary policy in a medium-scale model of the U.S. business cycle. The model features a rich array of real and nominal rigidities that have been identified in the recent empirical literature as salient in explaining observed aggregate fluctuations. The main result of the paper is that price stability appears to be a central goal of optimal monetary policy. The optimal rate of inflation under an income-tax regime is 1/2 percent per year, with a volatility of 1.1 percent. This result is surprising given that the model features a number of frictions-particularly nonstate-contingent nominal public debt, no lump-sum taxes, and sticky wages-that, in isolation, would call for a volatile rate of inflation. Under an income-tax regime, the optimal income-tax rate is quite stable, with a mean of 30 percent and a standard deviation of 1.1 percent. Simple monetary and fiscal rules are shown to implement a competitive equilibrium that mimics well the one induced by the Ramsey policy. When the fiscal authority is allowed to tax capital and labor income at different rates, optimal fiscal policy is characterized by a large and volatile subsidy on capital.

T2  - Eastern European Economics
AB  - This paper has three objectives. First, it aims to reveal the logic of interest rate settings pursued by the monetary authorities of twelve new EU members. Using an estimation of an augmented Taylor rule, we find that central banks in countries with flexible exchange rates respond mainly to (expected) inflation, though often rather loosely. Countries with fixed exchange rates seem to apply an interest rate peg with the euro. Second, it sheds light on the inflation processes of these countries. To this end, we estimate an open economy Phillips curve (PC) and find that inflation rates are not only driven by backward persistency, but also have a forward-looking component. Finally, we assess the viability of existing monetary arrangements for price stability, using the conditional inflation variance obtained from a generalized autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity estimation of the PC. We conclude that inflation targeting is preferable to an exchange rate peg because it allows for decreasing inflation rates as well as anchoring inflation volatility.

The growing body of empirical researches indicates that the adoption of IT is useful for countries that mustenhance their credibility for the management of monetary policy. Personally, the authors suggest that Uzbekistan should also take IT into account seriously and further consider. In the long run, without prejudice to the goal of price stability countries can achieve other objective: high employment, economic growth, financial markets stability, interest rate stability, and stability in foreign exchange markets.

AB  - This paper studies the implications of excess bank liquidity for the effectiveness of monetary policy in a simple model with credit market imperfections. The demand for excess reserves is determined by precautionary factors and the opportunity cost of holding cash. It is argued that excess liquidity may impart greater stickiness to the deposit rate in response to a monetary contraction and induce an easing of collateral requirements on borrowers – which in turn may translate into a lower risk premium and lower lending rates. As a result, asymmetric bank pricing behavior under excess liquidity may hamper the ability of a contractionary monetary policy to lower inflation.

AB  - We examine the evolution of monetary policy rules in a group of inflation-targeting countries (Australia, Canada, New Zealand, Sweden, and the United Kingdom), applying a moment-based estimator in a time-varying parameter model with endogenous regressors. From this novel flexible framework, our main findings are threefold. First, monetary policy rules change gradually, pointing to the importance of applying a time-varying estimation framework. Second, the interest-rate smoothing parameter is much lower than typically reported by previous time-invariant estimates of policy rules. External factors matter for all countries, although the importance of the exchange rate diminishes after the adoption of inflation targeting. Third, the response of interest rates to inflation is particularly strong during periods when central bankers want to break a record of high inflation, such as in the United Kingdom or Australia at the beginning of the 1980s. Contrary to common perceptions, the response becomes less aggressive after the adoption of inflation targeting, suggesting a positive anchoring effect of this regime on inflation expectations. This result is supported by our finding that inflation persistence typically decreased after the adoption of inflation targeting.

AB  - The existing literature on robust monetary policy rules has largely focused on the case in which the policymaker has a single reference model while the true economy lies within a specified neighborhood of the reference model. In this paper, we show that such rules may perform very poorly in the more general case in which non-nested models represent competing perspectives about controversial issues such as expectations formation and inflation persistence. Using Bayesian and minimax strategies, we then consider whether any simple rule can provide robust performance across such divergent representations of the economy. We find that a robust outcome is attainable only in cases where the objective function places substantial weight on stabilizing both output and inflation; in contrast, we are unable to find a robust policy rule when the sole policy objective is to stabilize inflation. We analyze these results using a new diagnostic approach, namely, by quantifying the fault tolerance of each model economy with respect to deviations from optimal policy.

AB  - Inflation has heterogeneous impacts on households, which then affects optimal monetary policy design. I study optimal monetary policy rules in a quantitative heterogeneous agent New Keynesian (HANK) model where inflation has redistributive effects on households through their different (1) consumption baskets, (2) nominal wealth positions, and (3) earnings elasticities to business cycles. I parameterize the model based on the empirical analysis of these channels using the most recent data. Unlike in representative agent models, a utilitarian central bank should adopt an asymmetric monetary policy rule that is accommodative towards inflation and aggressive towards deflation. Specifically, by accommodating stronger demand and higher inflation, the central bank benefits low-income and low-wealth households through nominal debt devaluation and higher earnings growth.

Non-parametric regression techniques are used to explore the shape of the RPV function, and this shape is related to the theory outlined by J. J. Rotemberg. The empirical RPV function yields a plausible ‘optimal’ value of inflation in the region of five percentage points, which is consistent with this theory and lies within the range of values cited by recent evaluations of ‘sand’ and ‘grease’ effects.

T2  - Bank of Japan Research Laboratory Series
AB  - The management of inflation expectations is one of the means by which central banks aim to achieve price stability. This is the reason why central bankers are required to have a deep understanding of the dynamics of inflation expectations. Kamada et al. (2015) examined a household survey and found that short-term and long-term inflation expectations behave differently: short-term expectations are easily affected by actual inflation, while long-term expectations are stable and immune to actual price developments. This result indicates that inflation expectations are anchored to a certain level in Japan from the long term point of view. Long-term expectations, however, are changeable and influenced by monetary policy. The price stability target and quantitative and qualitative monetary easing introduced by the Bank of Japan in 2013 are likely to raise and stabilize inflation expectations in Japan.

Such an effect may be due to the failure of the previous formal target, the M1 money supply, to successfully combat inflation.

AB  - Introducing a new survey of U.S. firms’ inflation expectations, we document key stylized facts involving what U.S. firms know and expect about inflation and monetary policy. The resulting time series of firms’ inflation expectations displays unique dynamics, distinct from those of households and professional forecasters. By any typical definition of “anchored” expectations, the inflation expectations of U.S. managers appear far from anchored, much like those of households. And like households, U.S. managers are largely uninformed about recent aggregate inflation dynamics or monetary policy. These results complement existing evidence on firms’ inflation expectations from other countries and confirm that inattention to inflation and monetary policy is pervasive among U.S. firms as well.

Inflation forecast targeting simplifies both implementation and monitoring of monetary policy. The weight on output stabilization determines how quickly the inflation forecast is adjusted towards the inflation target. Money growth or exchange rate targeting is generally inferior than inflation targeting and leads to higher inflation variability. Commitment to ‘target rules’ may be better than commitment to ‘instrument rules’.

AU  - Aron, J.

AB  - The adoption of inflation targeting in 2000 aimed to enhance the transparency and effectiveness of monetary policy in South Africa. Quantitative indexes reveal a strong rise in the transparency of monetary policy between 1994 and 2007. Inflation and interest rate expectations data, forward interest rate data and estimates of an interest rate policy rule, are used to explore the credibility and predictability of monetary policy since adopting inflation targeting. The evidence points to the new monetary policy framework being well-entrenched in financial markets’ expectations as early as 2001. Only small declines in interest rate forecast errors arise thereafter.

AB  - Contrary to the Fisherian theory of interest, previous studies document a negative relationship between REIT (Real Estate Investment Trust) returns and inflation. In this research, we re-examine this perverse inflation behavior by testing for the causal relationships among REIT returns, real activity, monetary policy, and inflation through a vector error correction model. Our results indicate that the observations of REIT returns as perverse inflation hedges are spurious. The observed negative relationship between REIT returns and inflation is in fact a manifestation of the effects of changes in monetary policies. These findings are consistent with Darrat and Glascock's (1989) evidence of monetary effects on REIT returns.

TI  - THE EFFECTS OF MONETARY POLICY ON INFLATION :EVIDENCE FROM SUB-SAHARAN AFRICA
AU  - JALLOW, MAMADOU
AB  - The study is meant to understand the relationship between money supply and inflation in SubSaharan Africa (SSA). The data employed in this study covers 34 Sub-Saharan African (SSA) countries using annual data from the World Bank Development Indicators (WDI), World Bank Governance Index (WGI) and Trading Economics data bank from 1995 to 2019, a span of 24 years. Given the different monetary policy regimes in Sub-Saharan Africa, the data was separated into fixed exchange rate regime countries and non-fixed exchange rate regime countries, and I conducted a separate estimation between the two regimes to compare the different results. The model was estimated using a panel model with random effect specification based on the outcome of the Hausman test conducted. The model relates inflation as a function of money supply, real interest rate, foreign exchange rate, real GDP, government expenditure, Brent oil prices and some exogenous variables such as population growth and government effectiveness which serve as a proxy for private consumption and institutional credibility respectively. Pre-estimation analysis was also conducted to ensure we have a clear understanding of the nature and distribution of the data to identify the most appropriate estimation to have accurate and reliable findings for statistical inference. The results of our estimation indicate that money supply has the only significant effect on inflation while government expenditure, real GDP, foreign exchange rate, Brent oil prices, government effectiveness, population growth and real interest rate have an insignificant or no effect on inflation in non-fixed exchange rate regimes. On the other hand, for fixed exchange rate regimes, Real interest rates, foreign exchange rates, Brent oil prices, government expenditure, population growth and government effectiveness have a significant effect on inflation while money supply and real GDP insignificantly affect inflation.  The study recommends that non-fixed exchange rate regimes should control inflation through manipulating the money supply; On the other hand, in fixed exchange rate regimes a credibility effect may explain the lack of correlation between money supply and inflation. In order to maintain credibility, it might be appropriate to pursue an effective exchange rate policy through an efficient governance system possibly coupled with a sustainable fiscal policy addressing the problems arising from government expenditure and private consumption.
