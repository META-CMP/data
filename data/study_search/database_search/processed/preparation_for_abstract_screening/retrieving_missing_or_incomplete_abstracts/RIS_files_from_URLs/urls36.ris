AB  - We propose a simple framework for analyzing a continuum of monetary policy rules characterized by differing degrees of credibility, in which commitment and discretion become special cases of what we call quasi-commitment. The monetary policy authority is assumed to formulate optimal commitment plans, to be tempted to renege on them, and to succumb to this temptation with a constant exogenous probability known to the private sector. By interpreting this probability as a continuous measure of the (lack of) credibility of the monetary policy authority, we investigate the welfare effect of a marginal increase in credibility. Our main finding is that, in a simple model of the monetary transmission mechanism, most of the gains from commitment accrue at relatively low levels of credibility.

TI  - Monetary Policy and Uncertainty About the Natural Unemployment Rate
AU  - Wieland, Volker
AB  - Inflation-targeting central banks have only imperfect knowledge about the effect of policy decisions on inflation. An important source of uncertainty is the relationship between inflation and unemployment. This Paper studies the optimal monetary policy in the presence of uncertainty about the natural unemployment rate, the short-run inflation-unemployment trade-off and the degree of inflation persistence in a simple macroeconomic model, which incorporates rational learning by the central bank as well as private sector agents. Two conflicting motives drive the optimal policy. In the static version of the model, uncertainty provides a motive for the policymaker to move more cautiously than they would if they knew the true parameters. In the dynamic version, uncertainty also motivates an element of experimentation in policy. I find that the optimal policy that balances the cautionary and activist motives typically exhibits gradualism, that is, it still remains less aggressive than a policy that disregards parameter uncertainty. Exceptions occur when uncertainty is very high and inflation close to target.

AB  - When a central bank commits credibly to a nonaccommodative monetary policy, observed inflation should be a stationary process. In countries where, for a variety of reasons, the determinants of inflation could lead it to follow a nonstationary process, the adoption of a credible disinflationary programme should therefore induce a fundamental change in the stochastic process governing inflation and, in particular, should diminish its persistence. This article studies the time-series properties of both inflation and core inflation during the 1995–2006 period for the Mexican economy, using recently developed techniques to detect a change in the persistence of economic time series. Consistently with the adoption of an inflation-targeting framework, the results suggest that inflation in Mexico seems to have indeed switched from a nonstationary to a stationary process around the end of year 2000 or the beginning of 2001.

AB  - A relevant and current policy debate is whether banking supervision should be assigned to the same institution (the central bank) that is responsible for monetary policy. This paper reviews the theoretical arguments advanced in favour and against the solution of having banking supervision performed by the central bank. We then provide some additional evidence on the inflation performance of OECD countries whose banking systems are classified according to the regulatory regime in place. We find that the inflation rate is considerably higher and more volatile in countries where the central bank acts as a monopolist in banking supervision than in countries where this responsibility is assigned either to another agency or to more than one agency (possibly including the central bank). Finally, we compare banks' pricing behaviour and performance in the two groups of countries.

T2  - Asian Economic and Financial Review
AB  - This study analyzed the impact of unconventional monetary policy tools on the expected inflation rates that global central banks targeted as a solution for the liquidity trap that many economies fell into during the 2008 financial crisis. The US economy was adopted as a case study for the period 2003 – 2018 with quarterly time series. The study model was based on credit variables (cr), actual federal interest rates (fir), and the monetary mass (M2), as independent variables and their effect on expected inflation rates as a dependent variable using Vector Auto Regression (VAR). The study found that the impact of credit volume changes on expected inflation rates was insignificant. This can be attributed to unconventional monetary policy tools, especially credit facilitation programs, since they aimed at stabilizing financial markets rather than stimulating higher inflation expectations. The zero-interest-rate policy adopted by the US Federal Reserve as of December 2008 contributed to boosting the expected inflation rates as indicated by the results of the study. The parameters were significant, and the relationship was inverse during the second lag interval. Theoretically, this was expected, according to Paul Krugman's model.

AU  - Lucas, Robert E.

T2  - Journal of Monetary Economics
AB  - This paper is concerned with the structure and time-consistency of optimal fiscal and monetary policy in an economy without capital. In a dynamic context, optimal taxation means distributing tax distortions over time in a welfare-maximizing way. For a barter economy, our main finding is that with debt commitments of sufficiently rich maturity structure, an optimal policy, if one exists, is time-consistent. In a monetary economy, the idea of optimal taxation must be broadened to include an ‘inflation tax’, and we find that time-consistency does not carry over. An optimal ‘inflation tax’ requires commitment by ‘rules’ in a sense that has no counterpart in the dynamic theory of ordinary excise taxes. The reason time-consistency fails in a monetary economy is that nominal assets should, from a welfare-maximizing point of view, always be taxed away via an immediate inflation in a kind of ‘capital levy’. This emerges as a new possibility when money is introduced into an economy without capital.

AB  - Using a VAR model of the American economy from 1984 to 2003, we find that, contrary to official claims, the Federal Reserve does not target inflation or react to "inflation signals." Rather, the Fed reacts to the very "real" signal sent by unemployment, in a way that suggests that a baseless fear of full employment is a principal force behind monetary policy. Tests of variations in the workings of a Taylor Rule, using dummy variable regressions, on data going back to 1969 suggest that after 1983 the Federal Reserve largely ceased reacting to inflation or high unemployment, but continued to react when unemployment fell "too low." Further, we find that monetary policy (measured by the yield curve) has significant causal impact on pay inequality - a domain where the Fed refuses responsibility. Finally, we test whether Federal Reserve policy has exhibited a pattern of partisan bias in presidential election years, with results that suggest the presence of such bias, after controlling for the effects of inflation and unemployment.

The trade-off, and therefore the misery index, differs across subgroups. For example, the young and left-leaning citizens are more concerned with unemployment than inflation.

Penulis menemukan bahwa selama masa krisis, aktifitas ini (QFA) ada dan dilakukan oleh bank sentral Indonesia. Hal ini berbeda dengan masa sebelum krisis dimana QFA memiliki besaran yang netral. Dalam kaitan interaksi kebijakan fiskalmoneter, fakta ini menunjukkan dominasi kebijakan fiskal pada masa setelah krisis. Analisa interaksi antara kebijakan fiskal dan moneter ini membawa implikasi kebijakan di Indonesia yakni perlunya disiplin dalam kebijakan fiskal dan perlunya komitmen untuk mempertahankan sustainability kebijakan tersebut. Kegagalan mencapai kebijakan fiskal yang optimal akan mengurangi efektifitas kebijakan moneter dalam rangka mengontrol inflasi meski dalam kerangka inflation targeting yang secara parsial sudah diimplementasikan oleh Bank Indonesia.Keyword: Quasi Fiscal Activities, Fiscal Policy, Monetary Policy, Inflation TargetingJEL: E11, E31, E52, E62

AU  - Smith, Peter

AB  - In this paper we examine whether or not the NKM is .t for the purpose of providing a suitable basis for the conduct of monetary policy through inflation targeting. We focus on a number of issues: the dynamic response of inflation to interest rates in a theoretical NKM under discretion and commitment to a Taylor rule; the implications for the specification of the New Keynesian Phillips equation of alternative models of imperfect competition in a closed and an open economy; the general equilibrium underpinnings of the IS function; the extent of empirical support for the NKM; what the empirical evidence on the NKM implies for inflation targeting. Our findings reveal a number of problems with the NKM. Theoretically, the NKM predicts that a discretionary increase in interest rates will increase inflation, not reduce it. This is supported by our VAR evidence. Estimates of the NKM indicate a negative relation between interest rates and inflation, but the signs in the structural equations are inconsistent with the theory. We conclude that the standard specifications of the inflation and output equations are inadequate and that these equations should be embedded in a larger model.

AB  - Central banks have a variety of tools for implementing monetary policy, but the tool that has received the most attention in the literature has been the overnight interest rate. The financial crisis that erupted in the summer of 2007 has refocused attention on other channels of monetary policy, notably the transmission of policy through the supply of credit and overall conditions in the capital markets. In 2008, the Federal Reserve put into place various lender-of-last-resort programs under section 13(3) of the Federal Reserve Act in order to cushion the strains on financial intermediaries’ balance sheets and thereby target the unusually wide spreads in a variety of credit markets. While classic monetary policy targets a price (for example, the federal funds rate), the liquidity facilities affect balance-sheet quantities. The financial crisis forcefully demonstrated that the collapse of the financial sector’s balance-sheet capacity can have powerful adverse effects on the real economy. We reexamine the distinctions between prices and quantities in monetary policy transmission.

AB  - We examine the performance and robustness properties of monetary policy rules in an estimated macroeconomic model in which the economy undergoes structural change and where private agents and the central bank possess imperfect knowledge about the true structure of the economy. Policymakers follow an interest rate rule aiming to maintain price stability and to minimize fluctuations of unemployment around its natural rate but are uncertain about the economy's natural rates of interest and unemployment and how private agents form expectations. In particular, we consider two models of expectations formation: rational expectations (RE) and learning. We show that in this environment the ability to stabilize the real side of the economy is significantly reduced relative to an economy under RE with perfect knowledge. Furthermore, policies that would be optimal under perfect knowledge can perform very poorly if knowledge is imperfect. Efficient policies that take account of private learning and misperceptions of natural rates call for greater policy inertia, a more aggressive response to inflation, and a smaller response to the perceived unemployment gap than would be optimal if everyone had perfect knowledge of the economy. We show that such policies are quite robust to potential misspecification of private sector learning and the magnitude of variation in natural rates.

AB  - The study explores the efficacy in the effective operation of monetary policy in Nigeria with emphasis in inflation. A number of monetary variables which include domestic credit, interest rate, exchange rate and broad money supply were employed for the study. Additionally, fiscal deficit and trade openness were included as a function of inflation in Nigeria. Again, to assess the impact of inflation on the country‟s growth rate, domestic credit and money supply were added to inflation as determinants of economic growth. A simple linear regression was adopted for the study and results reveal that domestic credit, fiscal deficit and a one year lag of inflation are statistically significant in explaining inflation in Nigeria. On the relationship between inflation and the explanatory variables: fiscal deficit, money supply and interest rate have a positive correlation with inflation while exchange rate, trade openness and past level of inflation have a negative impact on inflation. The findings also reveal that impact of inflation on economic growth is negative while that of money supply and domestic credit is positive. The study recommends, among other things, that since impact of inflation on economic growth is negative, policy measures aimed at curtailing such impact should include targeting of less than double digit inflation through effective monetary policy and increase in output and productivity through effective agriculture and full capacity utilization in manufacturing sector.

Monetary policy (interest rate) shocks are identified using modern Bayesian methods along with the more recent sign restrictions approach and the Panel Vector Autoregression framework. We find that contractionary monetary policy has a strong and negative effect on output, suggesting that it can lean against unexpected macroeconomic shocks even when the financial markets are yet to be well-developed. We also show that such monetary policy shock tends to stabilise inflation in these countries, albeit at a higher level due to supply-driven inflation on the back of large surge in food and fuel prices, while producing a strongly persistent negative effect on real equity prices. Our results are robust to changes in the specification, the methodology and sub-sample time horizon.

This article links economic openness to the slopes of aggregate supply (AS) and aggregate demand (AD) to explain why the openness-inflation relation can be ambiguous. Starting with a widely used assumption initiated by Romer (1993) that more open economies face greater output inflation tradeoffs, we demonstrate that greater output-inflation tradeoffs in more open economies (reflected in the steeper AS) induce policymakers to adopt more aggressive optimal monetary policy (reflected in the flatter AD). Empirical results from 15 developed countries’ data support our theoretical explanation on the recent empirical failure in finding the negative openness-inflation relation.

AB  - Sargent et Wallace (1981) ont construit un modèle d'hyperinflation qui démontre l'incapacité de la Banque Centrale à maîtriser l'inflation lorsque l'on pose explicitement la contrainte budgétaire de l'Etat. L'objectif de cet exercice était de montrer que même dans un modèle monétariste c'est la politique fiscale qui importe, en définitive, dans la lutte contre l'inflation. Cette modélisation était toutefois sujette à deux types de critiques. D'une part, les demandes d'actifs étaient mal justifiées. D'autre part, le schéma d'hyperinflation ignorait l'effet des variations du produit réel, ainsi que leur incidence sur la demande de monnaie. Le modèle que nous présentons à l'intérêt d'analyser simultanément ces mécanismes et de reposer sur des fondements micro-économiques " à la Sidranski ". De surcroît, notre formulation permet de prendre en compte les anticipations des agents relatives aux gains en capital sur leur détention de titres. La considération de coupons fixes en valeur nominale ou indexés est un aspect important du problème traité dans cet article. /// Sargent and Wallace [1981] use a hyperinflation model to challenge the ability of the Central Bank to exert a desired influence on the path of inflation either in the transition period or in the steady state when the government budget constraint is explicit. The game is to show that even in a Monetarist model it is the stance of fiscal policy which ultimately matters in the fight against inflation. Nevertheless, the formulation is vulnerable to two distinct criticisms. First, asset demands are poorly motivated. Second, the hyperinflation model ignores the effect of movements in real output and their effect on money demand. The formulation we present has the virtue that such changes could be simultaneously analysed, in addition to providing Sidrauski-type microfoundations. An additional source of richness in our formulation is that agents have to form expectations on the prospect of capital gains on outstanding bond holdings. The specification of fixed nominal or indexed coupon values on bonds is an important dimension to the problems in which we are interested. In this papers, we illustrate the circumstances under which the Central Bank can exert a desired influence on inflation path using monetary policy on its own, and provide expositions of the original Sargent and Wallace results.

AU  - Nicolay, Rodolfo

T2  - Journal of Economic Studies
AB  - Purpose Studies about the determinants of the clarity of central bank communication are still scarce. To the authors’ knowledge, there are no studies regarding emerging economies. The purpose of this paper is to contribute to the literature in the following aspects: to analyze the determinants of the clarity of the central bank communication in an inflation targeting emerging economy; observe the influence of inflation volatility over the clarity; and observe the effect of the monetary policy signaling over the clarity. Design/methodology/approach The work uses readability indexes to measure the clarity of central bank communication. The empirical analysis uses ordinary least squares and the Generalized Method of Moments with one- and two-step estimations. Findings The findings suggest the inflation volatility reduces the clarity of central bank communication. Moreover, the monetary policy signaling also affects the clarity, but the effect depends on the direction of the signal. Practical implications This paper observes the determinants of the clarity considering an emerging economy environment. The clarity of central bank communications is an important tool to access transparency. Hence, the analysis of what determines the clarity of central bank communication is a debate about the level of transparency accessed by the central bank. Originality/value There are no studies about the determinants of the clarity of central bank communication in emerging economies. Moreover, the novelty are the effects of inflation volatility and monetary policy signaling over the clarity.

T2  - Journal of Economic Studies
AB  - Purpose – This article aims to analyze if the adoption of inflation targeting in Brazil contributed to an improvement in the conduction of monetary policy capable of increasing credibility and reducing inflation without an increase in the sacrifice rate. Design/methodology/approach – Considering the Brazilian experience, this article estimates, through GMM and VAR methods, the offsetting effects of a monetary policy change on the output‐inflation and unemployment‐inflation trade‐offs. Findings – The findings denote that the disinflationary process implemented in Brazil, after the adoption of inflation targeting, is not associated with the emergence of the above‐mentioned trade‐offs. Furthermore, the development of credibility in the conduction of monetary policy is an important element responsible for the achievement of this result. Practical implications – Development of credibility is an important strategy for improving the conduction of the monetary policy. Originality/value – The results of the paper give some new insights about the conduction of monetary policy for developing countries, which have adopted inflation targeting.

AB  - This study aims to examine the effect of monetary policy to the inflation rate in Indonesia from January 2011 to December 2015 via conventional and sharia systems. Vector Error Correction Model (VECM) is adopted for that purpose. The result shows that in the long run, conventional monetary policy transmission has an effect on inflation rate in Indonesia. Interbank money market variable has negative and significant influence on the inflation rate. While the loan to deposit ratio variable does not. On the Islamic side, the results show that in the long run, Islamic monetary policy transmission has a negative effect on inflation in Indonesia and Islamic money market has significant positive effect.

TI  - Monetary Policy and the Causality Between Inflation and Money Supply in Indonesia
AU  - Ltd, ICB-InterConsult Bulgaria
T2  - Verslas: teorija ir praktika
AB  - Conceptually and empirically, inflation volatility in Indonesia is a monetary and fiscal phenomenon. This study focuses on the macroeconomic policy and public policy especially causality between two variables namely inflation and money supply in Indonesia. This study uses Indonesian macroeconomic data of inflation and money supply from the Bank of Indonesia publication during 2007.1–2017.7. Inflation is measured by the consumer price index, reflects the annual percentage change in costs of acquiring a basket of goods and services to the average consumers that may change at specified intervals. Meanwhile, money supply is measured by the currency, demand deposits, time deposits, and saving deposits. Methodically, this study uses the Granger Causality model to determine the causality between inflation and money supply. The results show that there is a one-way causality between inflation and money supply in Indonesia. These findings imply that money supply causes inflation, but not vice versa. This condition implies that the role of Indonesian Government and Bank of Indonesia were very crucial in managing and controlling macroeconomic policy and public policy. Then, analysis of money supply and inflation also related to impacting factors such as money laundering, role of banks, taxation, tax evasion, and corruption.

TI  - Modeling Monetary Policy In South Africa: Focus On Inflation Targeting Era Using A Simple Learning Rule
AU  - Naraidoo, Ruthira

T2  - International Business & Economics Research Journal (IBER)
AB  - A simple empirical nonlinear framework is used to analyze monetary policy between 1983 and 2007 in South Africa, focusing on the policy of inflation targeting introduced in Feb 2000, more precisely when the South African Reserve Bank (SARB) announced that an inflation zone targeting regime of 3-6% would be in place. We find that a model specification embodying a simple ‘inflation learning rule’ for the future inflation rate seems to provide a better understanding of the decision process made by the SARB in its interest rate setting policy. The main findings are:  1) that the adoption of inflation targeting led to significant changes in monetary policy, 2) post-2000 monetary policy is asymmetric as policymakers respond more to downward deviation of inflation away from the target, 3) post-2000 policymakers may be attempting to keep inflation within the 4.5%–6.9% range rather than pursuing a target zone of 3-6%, as generally pre-announced, and 4) the response of monetary policy to inflation is nonlinear as interest rates respond more when inflation is further from the target.

AB  - A money supply-reaction function is developed and estimated within the context of an IS-LM framework to test the responsiveness of the Federal Reserve to the government budget restraint and certain parameters of the model. The results reveal that a large portion of the recent expansion of the monetary base may be attributed to increases in government debt and provide an essential first step in quantifying the inflationary impact of deficits. The monetary base is also expanded in response to increases in inflationary expectations and previous increases in the monetary base, but is not statistically correlated to changes in the unemployment rate or potential national income, or to rises in interest rates caused by sources other than higher inflationary expectations, previous monetary policy, or the Treasury borrowing requirement.

TI  - What Can (Macro-) Prudential Policy do to Support Monetary Policy?
AU  - Borio, Claudio E. V.
AU  - Shim, Ilhyock
AB  - In the economic environment that has been emerging over the last couple of decades, it is more likely that the occasional build-up of financial imbalances, typically in the form of unsustainable credit and asset price booms, will occur against the background of low and stable inflation, posing a potential threat to financial and macroeconomic stability. This means that the scope for monetary policy to lean against the build-up may be more constrained than in the past, when those imbalances would normally develop alongside rising inflation. This puts a premium on a strengthening of the macroprudential orientation of prudential frameworks, designed to restrain the build up of the imbalances and to make the financial system better able to withstand their unwinding. In this paper, we review the progress made in this direction in recent years. We conclude that there is now a much keener awareness of the importance of a macroprudential orientation but that progress in making it operational, while considerable, has been slower. The main obstacles are of an analytical and, above all, institutional/political economy nature. We suggest ways in which these obstacles could be addressed and underline the potential complementary role that adjustments in monetary policy frameworks could play.

AB  - This chapter discusses the present state of knowledge about the phenomenon of inflation. It presents a definition of chronic inflation as a condition in which price increases of more than 20% per annum have been typical over an extended period. It turns out that only four countries—Argentina, Brazil, Chile, and Uruguay—meet that condition during the period since 1950. The close contenders are Iceland—with four consecutive years of inflation over 20% in 1973 through 1976—Paraguay with three years of over 20% inflation in 1954 through 1956, and Yugoslavia. There is a close relationship between the rate of inflation and the rate of increase in the money supply. The rate of monetary expansion tends, even in these chronic inflations, to be greater than the rate of increase of prices. If the amount of real purchasing power that is held in the form of cash is to increase through time, the money supply must rise more rapidly than the price level.

To measure financial instability, a multidimensional financial conditioning index is calculated following the ECB's approach. Using a fixed effects panel data model the study finds that adoption of IT policy in Asian economies has an adverse impact on financial stability, thus rejecting the ‘conventional wisdom’ hypothesis. Further, the Vector Autoregression (VAR) result shows that an IT regime increases housing returns and encourages investors to take higher risks.

TI  - Reputation in a model of monetary policy with incomplete information
AU  - Barro, Robert J.
T2  - Journal of Monetary Economics
AB  - Previous models of rules versus discretion are extended to include uncertainty about the policymaker's ‘type’. When people observe low inflation, they raise the possibility that the policymaker is committed to low inflation (type 1). This enhancement of reputation gives the uncommitted policymaker (type 2) an incentive to masquerade as the committed type. In the equilibrium the policymaker of type 1 delivers surprisingly low inflation — with corresponding costs to the economy — over an extended interval. The type 2 person mimics this outcome for awhile, but shifts eventually to high inflation. This high inflation is surprising initially, but subsequently becomes anticipated.

AU  - Issing, Mr Otmar
AB  - This paper outlines important lessons for monetary policy. In particular, the role of inflation targeting, which was much acclaimed prior to the financial crisis and since then has not lost much of its endorsement, is critically reviewed. Ignoring the relation between monetary policy and asset prices, as is the case in this monetary policy approach, can lead to financial instability. In contrast, giving, inter alia, monetary factors a role in central banks’ policy decisions, as is done in the ECB’s encompassing approach, helps prevent these potentially harmful side effects and thus allows for fostering financial stability. Finally, this paper makes a case against increasing the central banks’ inflation target.

AB  - Abstract A key feature of Australia’s economic performance in the 1970s and for most of the 1980s was relatively high inflation. In the 1970s, inflation rose more sharply than in other OECD countries and, in the 1980s, it came down more slowly than elsewhere. The high inflation brought with it significant real costs. It interacted with the tax system and distorted investment incentives, and it increased uncertainty surrounding relative price signals. As a result, investment flowed to property rather than to more productive uses (see Chapter 2).

TI  - Can central banks’ monetary policy be described by a linear (augmented) Taylor rule or by a nonlinear rule?
AU  - Castro, Vítor
T2  - Journal of Financial Stability
AB  - The original Taylor rule establishes a simple linear relation between the interest rate, inflation and the output gap. An important extension to this rule is the assumption of a forward-looking behaviour of central banks. Now they are assumed to target expected inflation and output gap instead of current values of these variables. Using a forward-looking monetary policy reaction function, this paper analyses whether central banks’ monetary policy can indeed be described by a linear Taylor rule or, instead, by a nonlinear rule. It also analyses whether that rule can be augmented with a financial conditions index containing information from some asset prices and financial variables. The results indicate that the monetary behaviour of the European Central Bank and Bank of England is best described by a nonlinear rule, but the behaviour of the Federal Reserve of the United States can be well described by a linear Taylor rule. Our evidence also suggests that only the European Central Bank is reacting to financial conditions.

AB  - Should inflation targeting involve some leaning against
the wind? Sweden provides a case study, since the Riksbank
has been leaning against the wind since 2010, stating concerns about risks associated with the household debt-to-income
ratio. The cost of this policy in terms of low inflation and high
unemployment is high. According to the Riksbank’s own analysis, the policy rate effect on household indebtedness is very
small, and any effect on risks associated with household debt
is miniscule. Indeed, much lower inflation than expected has
increased households’ debt burden and, if anything, increased
such risks

AB  - The rapid recovery of demand combined with supply constraints has led to rising prices during the past months. This is evident in oil and gas markets, but also in international trade, which has been thrown out of step by bottlenecks at Asian ports. This situation creates a trade-off for the European Central Bank, because a more expansionary monetary policy cannot mitigate the supply bottlenecks and supply-side restrictions, while a more restrictive monetary policy would slow down the economic recovery. For this reason, key interest rate hikes in the eurozone are not to be expected for 2022. If the supply-side factors become persistent and wage policy tries to pass the price effects on, monetary policy will be forced to become restrictive.

TI  - Inflation and economic growth: the search for a compromise for the Central Bank&#39;s monetary policy
AU  - Ltd, ICB-InterConsult Bulgaria
T2  - Banks and Bank Systems
AB  - The article analyzes the influence of inflation on economic growth and substantiates the main directions of increasing the effectiveness of the central bank&#39;s anti-inflation policy. In order to determine the limit of inflation, the excess of which has a negative impact on the economic growth, the relationship is analyzed between the inflation rate and the real GDP growth rate on the basis of IMF statistics using the example of 158 countries. It was determined that in 2010–2017, in the global economy, the 6.0% inflation was the marginal value of the inflation rate, beyond which the economic growth rate declined or slowed down. Given the inverse relationship between the inflation rate and the real GDP growth rates as well as empirical calculations for the period 1996–2017, the threshold for inflation rate for Ukraine at the level of 4.51% was determined based on empirical calculations for the 1996–2017 period. The results indicate that the National Bank of Ukraine set the inflation target above the level of the calculated threshold inflation. It has also been established that the link between the rates of nominal GDP growth, as opposed to real GDP, and the inflation rate, is more direct and more tight. It is substantiated that to analyze such dependence it is better to use GDP deflator instead of CPI. The results indicate that deflation constrains economic growth much less than inflation. In order to increase the effectiveness of the central bank’s pro-cyclical monetary policy aimed at supporting economic growth, the relationship between the rates of real GDP growth and the indicator characterizing the gap between the growth rates of M3 and inflation, which actually reflects the real money supply dynamics, is determined. The results obtained allowed to conclude that in 2009 and 2014-2017, the artificial “squeezing” of the money supply took place in Ukraine, resulting in a decrease in the level of the economy monetization by 22.0% in 2017 compared to 2013.It has been proved that in order to minimize the negative impact of inflationary processes on economic growth, the policy of the National Bank of Ukraine should be aimed at eliminating the artificial squeezing of the money supply through a reasonable increase in the economy monetization and the implementation of an effective monetary policy.

Again, interest rate, domestic investment and money supply were found to have significant positive impact on inflation in both the long and the short run for a specific period chosen for the study.The causal relationship shows that monetary policy rate granger causes money supply within the period understudyUnique contribution to theory and practice: The study recommends that policy makers need to keenly consider the levels of money supply in Ghana so as to ensure a stable retail price levels. The Government of Ghana needs to evaluate the prevailing levels of retail prices and set the interest rates on the 91-day Treasury bills because they are majorly treated as risk free rate hence determines other interest rates and inflation levels in Ghana.

AB  - Previous research on the optimal size of a monetary policy committee (MPC) focused on theoretical analyses and experimental studies. These studies suggest that the ideal monetary policy committee may not have many more than five members. In this paper we conduct an empirical cross-country study to explore whether there is a link between the size of an MPC and inflation volatility. The analysis for 75 countries which have adopted MPCs provides some support for the above suggestion: countries with less than five MPC members tend to have larger deviations from trend inflation than MPCs with five members; raising the number of MPC members above five does not contribute to a further reduction in volatility.

AB  - Over the last two decades, communication has become an increasingly important
aspect of monetary policy. These real-world developments have spawned a huge new
scholarly literature on central bank communication—mostly empirical, and almost
all of it written in this decade. We survey this ever-growing literature. The evidence
suggests that communication can be an important and powerful part of the central
bank’s toolkit since it has the ability to move financial markets, to enhance the predictability
of monetary policy decisions, and potentially to help achieve central banks’
macroeconomic objectives. However, the large variation in communication strategies
across central banks suggests that a consensus has yet to emerge on what constitutes
an optimal communication strategy.

TI  - Interaction Impact of Monetary Policy and Inflation on Corporate Debt in Developing Nations
AU  - Matemilola, Bolaji Tunde
AU  - Azali, Mohamed
AB  - Research Question: Several firms in developing countries are increasing debt capital to take advantage of debt interest tax-shield but they are also exposed to bankruptcy, especially during this recent coronavirus pandemic period. Motivation: After 60 years of scholarly research, the determination of firms’ capital structure is still a puzzle and is unending. Modigliani and Miller (1963) theory incorporates taxes and it allows for usage of 100 percent debt capital because of absence of bankruptcy costs; but Myers (1984) theory argues for the existence of an optimal capital structure that maximize firms’ value. This study provides empirical validation to the effectiveness of monetary policy to lower corporate debt in the firms’ capital structure. Idea: The article examines the moderating role of monetary policy on the relationship between corporate debt ratios and inflation rate in developing countries, and the moderating role of monetary policy on the relationship between corporate debt ratios and interest rate. Data: Monetary policy rate data are obtained from the official website of each country and from the Economics Trading Websites. Other macroeconomic data are obtained from the World Bank Databases. Institutional quality data are obtained from World Governance Indicators. The firm-level data are obtained from the Datastream databases. We use a total of 3,827 listed firms covering 2007 to 2015 periods. Method/Tools: The study applies the two-step system generalized method of moments which mitigate endogeneity problem. Findings: The findings reveal that monetary policy weakens the positive effect of inflation rate on corporate debt ratios. Conversely, monetary policy strengthens the negative effect of interest rates on corporate debt ratios. These findings suggest that that monetary policy appears effective to lower corporate debt ratios. Moreover, firms should take monetary policy signals into consideration when formulating capital structure decisions. Contributions: First, the article extends earlier studies by introducing new variable – the money market rate as a proxy for monetary policy and examine the issue of whether monetary policy moderate the relationship between inflation rate and corporate debt. Second, the article examines the issue of the moderating role of monetary policy on the relationship between interest rate and corporate debt.

TI  - Should Monetary Policy "Lean or Clean"?
AU  - OECD
AU  - White, William R.
T2  - Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas, Globalization and Monetary Policy Institute Working Papers
AB  - It has been contended by many in the central banking community that monetary policy would not be effective in “leaning” against the upswing of a credit cycle (the boom) but that lower interest rates would be effective in “cleaning” up (the bust) afterwards. In this paper, these two propositions (can’t lean, but can clean) are examined and found seriously deficient. In particular, it is contended in this paper that monetary policies designed solely to deal with short term problems of insufficient demand could make medium term problems worse by encouraging a buildup of debt that cannot be sustained over time. The conclusion reached is that monetary policy should be more focused on “preemptive tightening” to moderate credit bubbles than on “preemptive easing” to deal with the after effects. There is a need for a new macrofinancial stability framework that would use both regulatory and monetary instruments to resist credit bubbles and thus promote sustainable economic growth over time.

AB  - Brazil has put in place an inflation-targeting framework for monetary policy in mid-1999, less than six months after moving to a floating exchange rate system. This paper presents the macroeconomic background that has led to the shift in monetary policy regime, and describes the general institutional arrangements and operational framework that has been adopted. The paper also discusses the basic modeling approach that has aided the decision-making process in the initial phase of inflation targeting in Brazil. We describe the family of small-scale macroeconomic models that has been used for informing and disciplining discussions about monetary policy within the Central Bank. These models contain few equations and few variables, but carry a considerable theoretical content and provide a stylized representation of the monetary policy transmission mechanism. They are easily understood, and especially suitable for simulation of a wide range of issues. We conclude with the main lessons that may be drawn from the initial Brazilian experience with inflation targeting.

AB  - Recent evidence shows that different inflation rates have effects on long-run economic growth. We follow the increasing interest in the issue offering a new explanation for the influence of monetary policy on economic growth: cash requirements for household expenditures in education. We devise an endogenous growth model with cash-in-advance (CIA) constraints in several sectors (education, horizontal R&D, vertical R&D, and manufacturing and consumption) and study its steady-state and transitional dynamics. In particular, the CIA constraint in education expenditures of households is essential to obtain a negative relationship between inflation and economic growth on the long- run. Quantitatively, this monetary endogenous growth model replicates both the small influence of monetary policy on growth, while highlighting the effects it can have on welfare and the allocation of resources in different sectors in the economy.

AB  - This paper considers the impact of monetary policy on the inflation–output variability trade-off for Sri Lanka and in doing so, draws lessons for the formulation of early-stage monetary policy in developing economies. We examine how this trade-off has changed across different monetary policy episodes, and investigate the persistence of economic shocks on the variability of inflation and output. After exploring the contribution of monetary policy towards macroeconomic performance more generally, we use the experience of Sri Lanka to suggest that more recently formed central banks in developing economies should focus on inflation variability, especially where the impact of demand and supply shocks is less persistent.

AB  - In this study, empirical analyses are performed to study the effects of oil price changes on inflation in two groups of countries, namely the high versus low oil dependency groups. In addition, we also compare the relative effect of oil price with other types of shocks such as real exchange rate, domestic output and exporters’ production cost. We model the pass-through equation in an autoregressive distributed lag (ARDL) format and the model is estimated using pooled mean group method. Our results reveal that oil price change has its direct effect on domestic inflation in low oil dependency group but its impact is indirect on affecting the domestic inflation in the high oil dependency group through changes on the exporter's production cost. The main determinants of domestic inflation are real exchange rate and exporter's production cost (high oil dependency group) and domestic output and exporter's production cost (low oil dependency group). We suggest the policymaker to stabilize the effects of these shocks through monetary policy accommodate.

We find that activism of inflation-targeting countries tends to have increased before (not after) the adoption of the inflation-targeting policy framework and that these countries have experienced a decline in activism in recent years, albeit to different degrees. We further explore this result in terms of the constraint of an inflation target range by developing a formal theoretical model in a New Keynesian framework.

AB  - This paper examines postwar U.S. data and tests the implications of Ball and Mankiw's (1994) model of asymmetric price adjustment that monetary shocks have asymmetric effects on output and that the degree of asymmetry is positively related to movements in average inflation. The empirical analysis extends Cover's (1992) framework to allow the degree of asymmetry to depend on an expected inflation series generated from Hamilton's (1989) Markov switching model. The results indicate that monetary shocks display assymetric effects which are exacerbated by increases in average inflation and that negative monetary shocks have a larger absolute impact on output.

TI  - Monetary Policy, Inﬂation and Rational Asset Price Bubbles
AU  - Ikeda, Daisuke
AB  - This paper studies monetary policy in the New Keynesian model with rational asset price bubbles. The model features a ﬁnancial cost channel through which the shadow cost of borrowing aﬀects marginal cost and inﬂation. A bubble generates a boom by mitigating borrowing constraints and stimulating investment and hiring. But inﬂation remains moderate due to a fall in the cost of borrowing. Against this backdrop, Ramsey-optimal monetary policy calls for tightening to curb the boom. Strict inﬂation targeting is counterproductive in the short run as it exacerbates the boom. For obtaining these results the ﬁnancial cost channel and nominal wage rigidities are essential.

AB  - The paper considers optimal monetary stabilization policy in a forward-looking
model, when the central bank recognizes that private sector expectations
need not be precisely model-consistent, and wishes to choose a policy that will
be as good as possible in the case of any beliefs that are close enough to model-consistency.
It is found that commitment continues to be important for optimal
policy, that the optimal long-run inflation target is unaffected by the degree of
potential distortion of beliefs, and that optimal policy is even more history-dependent
than if rational expectations are assumed. (JEL C62, D84, E13, E31,

AB  - The interplay between policy-setting by the Federal Reserve and inflation is explored during a period with significant and diverse episodes from 1979 onwards. Our unrestricted estimates reveal a stable target path for the policy rate with a strong response to inflation and an effective control over it. We identify moments of discretionary and rule-based policy-making throughout three different chairmanships and quantify the degree of policy inertia. Including the ‘great recession’ and the first years after the crisis leaves the above-mentioned characteristics unchanged and shows that the adjustment to deviations from the target path becomes less gradual. Replacing the federal funds rate with a shadow rate yields ineffective inflation control, indicating that the dynamic behaviour of inflation is affected by the implementation of unconventional policy when the zero lower bound applies.

T2  - Journal of Monetary Economics
AB  - In a discretionary regime the monetary authority can print more money and create more inflation than people expect. But, although these inflation surprises can have some benefits, they cannot arise systematically in equilibrium when people understand the policymaker's incentives and form their expectations accordingly. Because the policymaker has the power to create inflation shocks ex post, the equilibrium growth rates of money and prices turn out to be higher than otherwise. Therefore, enforced commitments (rules) for monetary behavior can improve matters. Given the repeated interaction between the policymaker and the private agents, it is possible that reputational forces can substitute for formal rules. Here, we develop an example of a reputational equilibrium where the outcomes turn out to be weighted averages of those from discretion and those from the ideal rule. In particular, the rates of inflation and monetary growth look more like those under discretion when the discount rate is high.

TI  - Low-inflation-targeting monetary policy and differential unemployment rate: Is monetary policy to be blamed for the financial crisis? — Evidence from major OECD countries
AU  - Jean Louis, Rosmy
AU  - Balli, Faruk
T2  - Economic Modelling
AB  - Since the mid-1990s, monetary policy discussion has been centered around whether targeting inflation rate too low was responsible for the differential unemployment rate observed between major OECD countries and the US. In late 2000s with the financial crisis, critiques have argued that these economies had fallen into liquidity trap sooner because of the policy mistake of adhering to the 2% inflation target when the policy rate was already too close to zero. As the argument goes, since there was not enough room left to maneuver, central bankers were powerless in their attempt to revive the economy when aggregate demand collapsed. Using SVAR methodology, this paper formally investigates whether unanticipated deviation of OECD short-term rates from the fund rate can indeed explain differential unemployment rate with the US. It also discusses whether low-inflation targeting monetary policy is to be blamed for the financial crisis. The results show that interest rate differential shocks have no effects on unemployment in the very short-run. However, in the long-run, the cost for deviating drastically from US monetary policy is indeed higher and persistent unemployment at home, on average 30, 102, and 186 basis-points after 10, 15, and 20 quarters, respectively for the period 1989q1–2009q4. This cost is on average higher for inflation- than non-inflation targeting countries. These findings suggest that the fear of unemployment was partly the reason central bankers kept interest rate low since commodity prices were falling as a result of globalization while the economies were returning to normal partly due to positive supply shocks. Since Canada had its interest rate well aligned with the fund rate prior to the crisis while the inflation target was 2%, but did not suffer as much because sound mortgage rules and financial regulation were in place, the view that higher inflation target might have produced a different outcome does not seem to rest on firm grounds. Therefore, this paper lends support to the view that lax mortgage rules and financial deregulations in the US were the main factors responsible for the crisis.

TI  - The case for four percent inflation
AU  - Ball, Laurence M.
AB  - Many central banks target an inflation rate near two percent. This essay argues that policymakers would do better to target four percent inflation. A four percent target would ease the constraints on monetary policy arising from the zero bound on interest rates, with the result that economic downturns would be less severe. This benefit would come at minimal cost, because four percent inflation does not harm an economy significantly.

TI  - Money, Inflation, and Growth in Pakistan
AU  - Qayyum, Abdul
T2  - The Pakistan Development Review
AB  - This paper attempts to investigate the linkage between the excess money supply growth and inflation in Pakistan and to test the validity of the monetarist stance that inflation is a monetary phenomenon. The results from the correlation analysis indicate that there is a positive association between money growth and inflation. The money supply growth at first-round affects real GDP growth and at the second round it affects inflation in Pakistan. The important finding from the analysis is that the excess money supply growth has been an important contributor to the rise in inflation in Pakistan during the study period, thus supporting the monetarist proposition that inflation in Pakistan is a monetary phenomenon. This may be due to the loose monetary policy adopted by the State Bank of Pakistan to show the high priority of the growth objective. The important policy implication is that inflation in Pakistan can be cured by a sufficiently tight monetary policy. The formulation of monetary policy must consider development in the real and financial sector and treat these sectors as constraints on the policy.

T2  - International Journal of Business, Economics and Management
AB  - Oil revenues in many nations have remained largely unstable owing to factors like
volatility in global oil prices and output regulations among other international and
domestic issues, thereby affecting the stability of many oil-dependent economies. This
study examines the combined impacts of oil revenue and inflation on the economic
growth of Nigeria within the framework of the Autoregressive Distributed Lags models
(ARDL) while incorporating selected monetary policy measures in the model to fit into
the country’s inflationary scenario amidst dwindling oil revenue in recent times. The
empirical result provides evidence that both oil revenue and inflation exert significant
diametric impacts on economic growth in Nigeria. While the former demonstrates a
positive impact on growth the latter has a negative impact within the period of the
study (1981-2017). The Granger Causality test also provides complementary evidence
of causality from both oil revenue and monetary policy measures to growth.
Considering the vulnerability of oil revenue to external shocks, we strongly recommend
mapping out of aggressive diversification program to reduce the current huge
dependence on oil proceeds while the monetary authorities keep close tabs on
regulating the monetary environment to efficiently mitigate the negative impacts of
inflation to facilitate sustainable growth in the long-run

T2  - The Journal of Economic Asymmetries
AB  - This research paper aimed to assess the impact of uncertainties on the outcomes of monetary policy in Brazil after the adoption of inflation targeting. To this end, we adopted the methodology of vector autoregressions with an endogenous threshold (TVAR) and four distinct indicators to characterize regimes of high vs. low macroeconomic uncertainty. The analyzed sample varied from 2003 to 2021, with monthly data. Our results showed that uncertainty tended to increase during recessions in the country. Furthermore, in periods of higher instability, policy interest rate shocks exerted a lesser effect on aggregate production. However, the most significant influence of uncertainty occurred regarding inflation control, which was severely reduced when compared to more tranquil periods. Therefore, we concluded that uncertainty can harm monetary policy transmission in Brazil, especially for the adjustment of prices.

The inflation rate has a greater impact on the policy rate for New Zealand than for Australia and Canada whereas the output gap has a greater effect on the policy rate for Australia and Canada than for New Zealand. Since the adoption of inflation targeting, the intercept of the monetary-policy function has decreased in each of the three countries, and the slope coefficient of the inflation rate has increased for Australia and New Zealand but has decreased for Canada.

AU  - Mariscal, Iris Biefang‐Frisancho

T2  - International Review of Applied Economics
AB  - There is a widespread belief that the transparency of UK monetary policy has increased substantially as a result of the introduction of inflation targeting in 1992 and a number of procedural and institutional reforms which accompanied and followed it. Here, money market responses (and other data) are used to test the possibility that improved anticipation of policy moves may be the result of developments other than the institutional reforms popularly cited. We find overwhelming evidence that the switch to inflation targeting itself significantly reduced monetary policy surprises, while subsequent reforms have contributed little. Where we advance substantially on earlier work is to look at the cross‐sectional dispersion of agents’ anticipation. If the benefit of transparency is the elimination of policy surprise, there is little benefit if the averagely correct anticipations of agents conceal a wide dispersion of view.

TI  - Monetary Policy, Nominal Interest Rates, and Long–Horizon Inflation Uncertainty
AU  - Wright, Stephen
T2  - Scottish Journal of Political Economy
AB  - Empirical evidence presented in this paper shows that the predictability of inflation at long horizons varies considerably across countries. Both simple theory and empirical evidence suggest that the crucial factor is the extent to which systematic monetary policy succeeds in preventing a unit root in inflation. The mechanism by which it does this appears however to be complicated by strong empirical evidence that nominal as well as real interest rates have real effects, which implies that monetary policy need not be so vigorous in reactions to inflation. This helps to explain why inflation rates in the US and (especially) Germany have been relatively predictable, despite monetary policy rules which appear to have been barely stabilising. The paper also presents tentative evidence that the power of nominal interest rate effects is inversely related to long–horizon inflation uncertainty, and hence ultimately uncertainty about monetary policy.

AU  - Bean, Charles Richard
AB  - In this speech, Charlie Bean, Executive Director, Chief Economist and member of the Monetary Policy Committee, discusses the impact of globalisation on the industrialised countries and in particular the inflation process. He explains how globalisation has affected the returns to labour and capital, and the location of production in the world economy. Globalisation has also influenced relative prices, lowering the prices of imported goods but boosting the prices of oil and other commodities. And it may have changed the inflationary process, flattening the trade-off between domestic activity and inflation through a number of channels. Although globalisation has provided a benign backdrop for monetary policy, it poses a number of challenges going forward: the beneficial tailwind has waned and changes in product and labour markets have altered the determination of prices and wages in ways central bankers do not yet fully understand.

TI  - Monetary Policy Rules and Inflation Process in Open Emerging Economies: Evidence for 12 New EU Members
AU  - Vasicek, Borek
AB  - This paper has three objectives. First, it aims at revealing the logic of interest rate setting pursued by monetary authorities of 12 new EU members. Using estimation of an augmented Taylor rule, we find that this setting was not always consistent with the official monetary policy. Second, we seek to shed light on the inflation process of these countries. To this end, we carry out an estimation of an open economy Philips curve (PC). Our main finding is that inflation rates were not only driven by backward persistency but also held a forward-looking component. Finally, we assess the viability of existing monetary arrangements for price stability. The analysis of the conditional inflation variance obtained from GARCH estimation of PC is used for this purpose. We conclude that inflation targeting is preferable to an exchange rate peg because it allowed decreasing the inflation rate and anchored its volatility.

AB  - This article aims to review the monetary policy rule under inflation targeting framework focusing on Mongolia. The empirical analysis estimates the policy reaction function to see if the inflation targeting has been linked with a monetary policy rule emphasizing on inflation stabilization since its adoption in 2007. The study contributes to the literature by examining the linkage between Mongolian monetary policy rule and inflation targeting directly and thoroughly for the first time and also by taking into account a recent progress in the inflation targeting framework toward forward-looking mode. The main findings were: the Mongolian current monetary policy rule under inflation targeting is characterized as inflation-responsive rule with forward-looking manner (one quarter ahead); the inflation responsiveness is, however, weak enough to be pro-cyclical to inflation pressure; and the rule is also responsive to exchange rate due to the "fear of floating", which weakens the policy reaction to inflation and output gap.

TI  - Essays on Monetary Policy and Inflation in the United States - ProQuest
AB  - This dissertation contributes to two areas of Macroeconomics: (1) welfare effects of inflation and (2) monetary policy and asset prices. The first chapter focuses on examining the
redistributional effects of inflation in the United States in a cash-in-advance economy framework. Most literature on the welfare effects of inflation has largely focused on the aggregate
welfare effects of inflation without much assessment about it’s redistributional effects. The
first chapter examines, quantitatively, how different income brackets in the U.S. would be
impacted in terms of consumption and asset positions if long-run inflation were to rise.
The second and third chapters focus on the latter strand of macroeconomics. Recently, central bankers around the world have been debating on what should be the appropriate response of monetary policy to large swings in asset prices. In this spirit, chapter
2 examines what would have happened if the Federal Reserve had reacted to stock price
misalignments prior to crashes and major financial crises such as the Great Recession by
extending the standard New Keynesian model to include asset prices. First, the proposed
model is used to estimate the response of monetary policy to the stock market using Bayesian
techniques. We find that the Federal Reserve did not react to U.S. stock market fluctuations
during the Great moderation period. We then undertake a counterfactual experiment in which we assume that the Federal Reserve targets stock price misalignments in addition
to inflation and output gap. Our policy experiment suggests that had the Federal Reserve
raised their policy rate in response to rising stock prices, the boom-bust cycle of stock prices
would have been substantially reduced and surprisingly, this would not have been associated
with a decrease in average output. For example, the exuberance of the dotcom in the late
1990s and the boom in stock prices associated with the housing market in the mid 2000s
would have been milder. Further, the severity of the Great Recession in terms of output
loss would have been significantly lower had the policy rate been reactive to rising stock
prices prior to the crisis. In the wake of the Great Recession, this chapter contributes to
the current debate on whether central banks should target asset price misalignments.
The third chapter extends the second chapter to include financial intermediaries to
emphasize the role of credit spreads that serve as an important business cycle propagation
mechanism. This chapter asks three related questions. First, to what extent has the Federal
Reserve adjusted interest rates in response to movements in credit spreads in the past and
whether this response has evolved overtime. Second, how does the presence of financial
intermediaries that are a source of credit growth, contribute to the fluctuations in the
macroeconomy in the face of a monetary policy shock. Third, what effect does a financial
shock that tends to increase credit spreads have on macro variables in the economy?

We find that the contemporaneous Taylor rule produces a lower uncertainty and higher accuracy of interval forecasts than the forward-looking Taylor rule. The latter also produces a lower uncertainty when the reaction coefficient is high, 4, than rules with lower reaction coefficients, 1.5 and 1.35. Subjects perceive the underlying inflation uncertainty correctly in only 60% of cases, and tend to report asymmetric confidence intervals, perceiving a higher level of uncertainty with respect to inflation increases.

T2  - CESifo Economic Studies
AB  - As the Chinese economy becomes more market based and continues its rapid integration into the global economy, having an independent and effective monetary policy regime oriented to domestic objectives will become increasingly important. Employing modern principles of monetary policy in light of the current state of China's financial institutions, we motivate and present a package of proposals to guide the operation of a new monetary policy regime. Specifically, we recommend an explicit low long-run inflation objective, operational independence for the People's Bank of China (PBC) with formal strategic guidance from the government, and a minimal set of financial sector reforms (to make the Chinese banking system robust against interest rate fluctuations). We argue that anchoring monetary policy with an explicit inflation objective would be the most reliable way for the PBC to tie down inflation expectations, and thereby enable monetary policy to make the best contribution to macroeconomic and financial stability, as well as economic growth. The management and monitoring of money (and credit) growth by the PBC would continue to play a useful role in the stabilization of inflation, but a money target would not constitute a good stand-alone nominal anchor.

AB  - The paper examines the monetary policy actions through which central banks in sub-Saharan Africa have tried to eliminate the negative impacts of the shocks facing their economies. We compare two different monetary policy regimes: a currency board regime (in the CFA zone) and an inflation targeting policy regime (Ghana and South Africa) when central banks respond to demand, supply, and fiscal shocks. We extend the usual forecasting and policy analysis system models to replicate the economic features of these economies during the period 2002–12 and to evaluate the impact of several policies in response to these shocks. We find that both policies are inappropriate in helping the economies escape from the effects of negative demand shocks, both are essential when negative shocks to primary balance occur, while inflation targeting dominates the currency board regime as a strategy to cope with positive shocks to inflation.

TI  - Monetary-Fiscal Mix and Inflation Performance: Evidence from the Us
AU  - Favero, Carlo A.
AU  - Monacelli, Tommaso
AB  - There has been a lot of interest recently in developing small-scale rule-based empirical macro models for the analysis of monetary policy. These models, based on the conventional view that inflation stabilization should be a concern of monetary policy only, have typically neglected the role of fiscal policy. We start with the evidence that a baseline VAR-augmented Taylor rule can deliver recurrent mispredictions of inflation in the US before 1987. We then show that a fiscal feedback rule, in which the primary deficit reacts to both the output gap and the government debt, can well characterize the behaviour of fiscal policy throughout the sample. By employing Markov-switching methods, however, we find evidence of substantial instability across fiscal regimes. Yet precisely this happens before 1987. We then augment the monetary VAR with a fiscal policy rule and control for the endogenous regime switches for both rules. We find that in the pre-1987 period the model based on the two rules predict the behaviour of inflation better than the one based just on the monetary policy rule. After 1987, when fiscal policy is estimated to switch to a regime of fiscal discipline, the monetary-fiscal mix can be appropriately described as a regime of monetary dominance. Over this period a monetary policy rule based model is always a better predictor of the inflation behaviour than the one comprising both a monetary and a fiscal rule.

TI  - Inflation persistence and monetary policy: A simple result
AU  - Amano, Robert
T2  - Economics Letters
AB  - This note explores the interaction between monetary policy and structural inflation persistence in the context of a new Keynesian inflation model. We solve the monetary policy problem under discretion and find that optimal monetary policy is a function of the relative weight on the output gap in the welfare-theoretic stabilization objective, the responsiveness of inflation to fluctuations in the output, and the perceived degree of inflation persistence. Within our simple framework we find that underestimating inflation persistence always reduces inflation variability.

T2  - Journal of Asian Economics
AB  - This paper examines the relationship between nominal interest rates and the expected inflation rate for the Turkish economy between 2002 and 2009, a period when the inflation-targeting regime was implemented as monetary policy. We use the test of cointegrating rank with a trend-break (a method introduced by Inoue, 1999) and we also apply exogeneity tests. Empirical findings indicate that monetary policy rates depend on inflationary expectations; long-term interest rates are affected by monetary policy; and the weak form of the Fisher effect is valid. This evidence implies that monetary policy has actually influenced the real long-term interest rates; the inflation targeting regime pursued by the Central Bank of Turkey is reliable; and hence realized inflation has remained close to its targeted level.

TI  - Fiscal deficits and inflation risks: the role of fiscal and monetary policy regimes, SUERF Policy Brief .:. SUERF - The European Money and Finance Forum
T2  - SUERF.ORG
AB  - Using data from a panel of advanced economies over four decades, we show that the inflationary effect of fiscal deficits crucially depends on the prevailing fiscal-monetary policy regime. Under fiscal dominance, defined as a regime in which the government does not adjust the primary balance to stabilise debt and the central bank is less independent, the average effect of higher deficits on inflation is found to be up to five times larger than under monetary dominance. Moreover, both the mean and the variance of future inflation are higher under fiscal dominance compared to monetary dominance. Based on forecasts from our model, the high inflation experienced by many countries during the recovery from the Covid-19 pandemic appears more consistent with a regime of fiscal dominance than monetary dominance.

AB  - This paper proposes a theory of the fiscal foundations of inflation based on imperfect knowledge and learning. Because imperfect knowledge breaks Ricardian equivalence, the scale and composition of the public debt matter for inflation. High and moderate duration debt generates wealth effects on consumption demand that impairs the intertemporal substitution channel of monetary policy: aggressive monetary policy is required to anchor inflation expectations. Counterfactual experiments conducted in an estimated model reveal that the US economy would have been substantially more volatile over the Great Inflation and Great Moderation periods if US debt levels had been those observed in Italy or Japan.

TI  - Impact of monetary policy on inflation rate in Nigeria: Vector Autoregressive Analysis

AB  - The Nigerian monetary authorities have implemented several monetary management policies with the aim of achieving price stability and economic growth in the country, but without success. This study was conducted to examine the impact of monetary policy management on inflation in Nigeria during the 1985- 2019. Autoregressive distributed lag analysis was employed on time series data covering the period. It was found that while monetary policy rate and foreign exchange rate impacted negatively on inflation; broad money supply impact positively on it. Therefore, the study recommended that monetary authorities should fix the exchange rate at where the value of Naira will rise. Besides, government should direct more investment on productive activities in other to increase output of goods and services in the country. This will lead to a fall in inflation rate and hence economic growth in the country.

AB  - This article analyzes how announced surprises in monetary policy actions and macroeconomic data releases affect the average rate of inflation that economic agents expect to prevail over the 10-year period following the surprise. The analysis also addresses the effect of Federal Reserve communication and surprises in monetary policy actions on perceived inflation risk over this 10-year period. The study shows that surprises in macroeconomic data releases and monetary policy actions indeed affect the expected rate of inflation. Further, there is evidence that surprises in monetary policy actions increase perceived inflation risk, whereas Federal Reserve communication reduces it.

AB  - This paper investigates the impact of monetary policy on stock returns in 13 OECD countries over the period 1972–2002. Our results indicate that monetary policy shifts significantly affect stock returns, thereby supporting the notion of monetary policy transmission via the stock market. Our contribution with respect to previous work is threefold. First, we show that our findings are robust to various alternative measures of stock returns. Second, our inferences are adjusted for the non-normality exhibited by the stock returns data. Finally, we take into account the increasing co-movement among international stock markets. The sensitivity analysis indicates that the results remain largely unchanged.

AB  - We assess the prospects for central banks using inflation expectations as a policy tool for stabilization purposes. We review recent work on how expectations of agents are formed and how they affect their economic decisions. Empirical evidence suggests that inflation expectations of households and firms affect their actions but the underlying mechanisms remain unclear, especially for firms. Two additional limitations prevent policy-makers from being able to actively manage inflation expectations. First, available surveys of firms' expectations are systematically deficient, which can only be addressed through the creation of large, nationally representative surveys of firms. Second, neither households' nor firms' expectations respond much to monetary policy announcements in low-inflation environments. We provide suggestions for how monetary policy-makers could pierce this veil of inattention through new communication strategies as well as the potential pitfalls to trying to do so.

Using a unique database that includes quarterly balance sheet information for listed banks operating in the European Union and the United States in the last decade, we find evidence that unusually low interest rates over an extended period of time contributed to an increase in banks' risk. This result holds for a wide range of measures of risk, as well as macroeconomic and institutional controls.
