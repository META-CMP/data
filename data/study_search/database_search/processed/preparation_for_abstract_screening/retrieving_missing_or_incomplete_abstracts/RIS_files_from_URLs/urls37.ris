TI  - Financial market reaction to central bank monetary policy communications under an inflation- targeting regime: the case of Brazil
AU  - Caldas M., Gabriel
AB  - Central bank communications are important for guiding expectations. For emerging countries, however, research on this issue is scarce. Because Brazil represents an important emerging country under inflation targeting, this paper studies the influence of monetary policy and central bank communications on the term structure of interest rates in Brazil. The study uses ordinary least squares (ols), generalized method of moments (gmm) and vector autoregresion (var) to examine the direction taken by interest rates when affected by central bank communications and monetary policy. The study finds evidence that because economic agents analyse the minutes of the Monetary Policy Committee meetings, monetary policy and central bank communications significantly influence the process of expectations formation for interest rates with different maturities in Brazil.

AB  - Monetary policy communication is particularly important during unconventional times, because high uncertainty about the economy, the introduction of new policy tools and possible limits to the central bank’s toolkit could hamper the predictability of policy actions. We study how monetary policy communication should and has worked under such circumstances. Our main results relate to announcements of asset purchase programmes and the use of forward guidance. We show that announcements of asset purchase programmes have lowered market uncertainty, particularly when accompanied by a contextual release of implementation details such as the envisaged size of the programme. We also show that forward guidance reduces uncertainty more effectively when it is state‐contingent or when it provides guidance about a long horizon than when it is open‐ended or covers only a short horizon, and that the credibility of forward guidance is strengthened if the central bank also has embarked on an asset purchase programme.

T2  - PSL Quarterly Review
AB  - The present paper examines the thesis that monetary policy cannot be used as a weapon against domestic inflation in a surplus country under a regime of fixed exchange rates. The conditions under which the effective execution of domestic monetary policy is hampered by a balance-of-payments surplus are thus examined. The authors restrict their analysis to the case of a European country that is subjected to inflationary pressures because of a capital inflow from the United States. Two kinds of constraints are alleged to hinder the use of monetary policy, internal and external, both of which are considered in turn. The authors find that under certain conditions neither internal nor external constraints vitiate effective monetary action. Moreover, it is argued that the freedom of capital movements in a fixed exchange rate system necessarily eliminates the possibility of connecting national monetary policies. JEL: E31, E42, E52, F32

A2  - Cheng, Hang-Sheng
AB  - Future historians are likely to view China’s economic reform since 1978 as one of the most notable world economic developments in the last quarter of the twentieth century. In an attempt to modernize the economy, the nation of more than one billion population has tried to extricate itself from an excessively rigid planning system that had suffocated productive incentives and retarded technological progress over the previous 25 years. To date, sufficient progress has been made to suggest that, if the momentum of reform is sustained, China may well become before the end of this century another newly industrial country — except that, given the size of the economy, the significance of its rise would undoubtedly overshadow that of all the existing newly industrial countries put together.

TI  - UK Monetary Policy 1972-97: A Guide Using Taylor Rules
AU  - Nelson, Edward
AB  - In the period from the floating of the exchange rate in 1972 to the granting of independence to the Bank of England in 1997, UK monetary policy went through several regimes, including: the early 1970s, when monetary policy was subordinate to incomes policy as the primary weapon against inflation; Sterling M3 targeting in the late 1970s and early 1980s; moves in the late 1980s toward greater exchange rate management, culminating in the UK's membership of the ERM from 1990-92; and inflation targeting from October 1992. This Paper estimates simple interest rate reaction functions, or 'Taylor rules', for different UK monetary policy regimes. The inflation targeting regime that began in 1992 appears to be the only period that is characterised by the 'Taylor principle', namely a greater than one for one response of interest rates to fluctuations in inflation. In contrast to the US case, the early 1980s disinflation in the UK appears best characterised as an increase in the intercept of the authorities' interest rate rule rather than by an increased systematic response of monetary policy to inflation.

AB  - We examine the implications of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) framework for the monetary policy–equity returns relationship in the UK. Using a standard event study methodology, we do not find a significant relationship between market-based policy surprises and equity returns. After controlling for joint response bias using Thornton's (in press) framework, we find that unexpected policy rate changes enter the stock prices discovery process. Moreover, we produce evidence that the impact of MPC policy decisions on equities depends on the MPC members' voting record publication, especially when the last reveals unanimity versus dissent voting.

AB  - This paper explores a model of wage adjustment based on the assumption that information disseminates slowly throughout the population of wage setters. This informational frictional yields interesting and plausible dynamics for employment and inflation in response to exogenous movements in monetary policy and productivity. In this model, disinflations and productivity slowdowns have a parallel effect: They both cause the path of employment to fall below the level that would prevail under full information. The model implies that, in the face of productivity change, a policy of targeting either nominal income or the nominal wage leads to more stable employment than does a policy of targeting the price of goods and services. Finally, we examine U.S. time series and find that, as the model predicts, unemployment fluctuations are associated with both inflation and productivity surprises.

AU  - Beyer, Andreas

AU  - Gerberding, Christina
AU  - Issing, Otmar
AB  - During the turbulent 1970s and 1980s the Bundesbank established an outstanding reputation in the world of central banking. Germany achieved a high degree of domestic stability and provided safe haven for investors in times of turmoil in the international financial system. Eventually the Bundesbank provided the role model for the European Central Bank. Hence, we examine an episode of lasting importance in European monetary history. The purpose of this paper is to highlight how the Bundesbank monetary policy strategy contributed to this success. We analyze the strategy as it was conceived, communicated and refined by the Bundesbank itself. We propose a theoretical framework (following Söderström, 2005) where monetary targeting is interpreted, first and foremost, as a commitment device. In our setting, a monetary target helps anchoring inflation and inflation expectations. We derive an interest rate rule and show empirically that it approximates the way the Bundesbank conducted monetary policy over the period 1975-1998. We compare the Bundesbank's monetary policy rule with those of the FED and of the Bank of England. We find that the Bundesbank's policy reaction function was characterized by strong persistence of policy rates as well as a strong response to deviations of inflation from target and to the activity growth gap. In contrast, the response to the level of the output gap was not significant. In our empirical analysis we use real-time data, as available to policy-makers at the time.

AB  - The experience of the U.S. economy during the mid-1930s, when short-term nominal interest rates were continuously close to zero, is sometimes taken as evidence that monetary policy was ineffective and the economy was in a “liquidity trap.” Close examination of the historical policy record for the period indicates that the evidence does not support such assertions. The incomplete and erratic recovery from the Great Depression can be traced to a failure to pursue consistently expansionary policy resulting from an incorrect understanding of monetary policy in an environment of very low short-term nominal interest rates. Commonalities with the Japanese experience during the late 1990s, and the inadequacy of short-term interest rates as indicators of the stance of monetary policy are discussed and a robust operating procedure for implementing monetary policy in a low-interest-rate environment by adjusting the maturity of targeted interest-rate instruments is described.

We use this cross-country variation in the (local) tightness of monetary policy to examine its influence on equity and money market flows. In line with a powerful risk-shifting channel, we find that fund investors in countries with decreased real interest rates shift their portfolio investment out of the money market and into the riskier equity market, causing significant equity price inflation in countries where investment home bias is the strongest.

TI  - Inflation Targeting and Financial Stability: Monetary Policy Challenges for the Future
AU  - Heise, Michael
AB  - Since the financial crisis of 2008/09, the world’s major central banks have been struggling to return their economies to higher growth and to reach their inflation targets. This concise book analyzes the importance of central bank policies for the economy, and specifically investigates the reasons why they have failed to steer inflation as desired. The author, the Chief Economist at Allianz SE, argues that, in an environment of great uncertainty concerning the pass-through of monetary stimulus to the economy, central banks should not focus too narrowly on inflation targets, but should increasingly take the side effects of their actions into account. In particular, he contends that they must seek to minimize the risk of financial booms and busts in order to maximize long-term growth and prosperity.Building on existing research and contributing to the current debate, the book offers a valuable reference guide and food for thought for policymakers, professionals and students alike.

Thus it is impossible to find a common monetary policy that will result in price stability in all countries. Based on empirical estimates of the Balassa model, the paper calculates a minimum aggregate inflation rate which is compatible with the requirement that no country face a deflation. This minimum aggeragate inflation rate is 0.94% in the euro-11 countries and 1.13% in an extended Europe which incorporates the east European countries.

TI  - Macroeconomic Theories of Inflation
AU  - Totonchi, Jalil
AB  - The study of causes of inflation has probably given rise to one of the most significant macroeconomic debates in the field of economics. In practice; however, it is not always easy to decompose the observed inflation into its monetary, demand-pull, cost-push and structural components. The process is dynamic, and the shocks to prices are mixed. Furthermore, inflation itself may also cause future inflation. This paper, mainly attempts to review and analyze the competing and complementary theories of inflation. The theoretical survey in this research work yielded a six-blocked schematization of origins of inflation; monetary shocks, Demand side, supply-side (or real) shocks, structural and political factors (or the role of institutions). It appeared that inflation is the net result of sophisticated dynamic interactions of these six groups of explanatory factors. That is to say, inflation is always and everywhere a macroeconomic and institutional phenomenon.

Much of this discussion has been of an increasingly hysterical and political nature and has served to blur rather than inform. This book, written by a team at the ECB, including Otmar Issing the ECB's Chief Economist, provides the first comprehensive, inside, non-technical analysis of the monetary policy strategy, institutional features and operational procedures of the Eurosystem. The goals and the transmission mechanism of monetary policy are explored, as are the theoretical and empirical results underpinning the 'stability-oriented monetary policy strategy' adopted by the ECB. The characteristics of this strategy are also discussed in comparison with suggested alternatives.

We evaluate this thesis in the context of a standard New Keynesian model against a version of the model that incorporates incomplete information learning about the true state of the economy. The likelihood-based estimation of the model overwhelmingly favors the specification with indeterminacy over the alternatives with determinacy, independent of the presence and size of misperceptions.

AB  - With few exceptions the last decades have seen reductions in inflation around the world. This experience is the result of many factors. In this paper, we seek to isolate one of the factors, namely, improvements in the quality of monetary policy. We estimate a gravity—like model and propose an exhaustive analysis of the potential role for a large number of institutional factors. Briefly, we find that institutional factors help explain inflation relative to the US experience, which is used as the benchmark. Nevertheless, a role for greater central bank autonomy is a feature of the 1980s and early 1990s only.

TI  - Monetary Policy and Inflation Performance: Evidence from Exchange Rate Regimes in Sri Lanka
AU  - Harischandra, Pkg
T2  - Staff Studies
AB  - This paper examines empirical evidence on monetary policy and inflation performance across exchange rate regimes in Sri Lanka. The criterion used to examine inflation performance is the degree of inflation persistence. Three alternative definitions of inflation persistence are used to model inflation dynamics. First, autocorrelation properties of inflation process are examined. Estimates of traditional Phillips curve and the hybrid-new Keynesian Phillips curve (H-NKPC) suggest a significant upward shift in inflation persistence following the change in exchange rate system in late 1977. Recursive estimates of coefficient on lagged inflation and Chow parameter stability tests confirm these results. Second, inflation response to systematic monetary policy actions is examined. Results suggest that inflation is more persistent and monetary policy is more accommodative in the flexible exchange rate regime. However, the correlation between money growth and inflation is found to be modest. Finally, inflation response to non-systemic policy actions (i.e., policy shocks) is examined through impulse response functions of an unrestricted VAR system. Results suggest that policy shocks are more persistent in the flexible exchange rate regime, than in the fixed exchange rate regime. However, maximum lag length of inflation response to a policy shock is not significantly different across regimes, suggesting that results from the impulse response analysis are inconclusive. Overall, there is substantial evidence to suggest that the shift in inflation persistence coincides with the change in exchange rate regimes. Moreover, during the flexible regime, higher monetary accommodation has resulted in higher inflation persistence. Because of sluggish response of inflation to changes in monetary policy measures, more stringent monetary policy measures may be needed to curb inflationary pressures.

TI  - Term Structures of Inflation Expectations and Real Interest Rates: The Effects of Unconventional Monetary Policy
AU  - Aruoba, S. Boragan
AB  - Inﬂation expectations have recently received increased interest because of the uncertainty created by the Federal Reserve’s unprecedented reaction to the Great Recession. The eﬀect of this reaction on the real economy is also an important topic. In this paper I use various surveys to produce a term structure of inﬂation expectations — inﬂation expectations at any horizon from 3 to 120 months —and an associated term structure of real interest rates. Inﬂation expectations extracted from this model track actual (ex-post) realizations of inﬂation quite well, and in terms of forecast accuracy they are at par with or superior to some popular alternatives obtained from ﬁnancial variables. Looking at the period 2008—2013, I conclude that the unconventional policies of the Federal Reserve kept long-run inﬂation expectations anchored and provided a large level of monetary stimulus to the economy.

AB  - This discusses the unique experience of Peru`s Central Bank with inflation targeting in an economy characterized by a high degree of financial dollarization. The paper outlines how Peru has taken financial dollarization into consideration in the design of monetary policy, then deals with monetary policy implementation and the Central Bank`s strategy for controlling financial dollarization risks. The paper concludes with analysis and lessons drawn from the Peruvian case.

AU  - Leith, Campbell

T2  - The Economic Journal
AB  - The Fiscal Stability Pact for EMU implies that constraints on fiscal policy facilitate inflation control. In this paper we identify two stable policy regimes. When monetary policy seeks to raise real interest rates in response to excess inflation, a self-stabilising fiscal policy is required to ensure model stability. A fiscal policy which does not, by itself, ensure fiscal solvency constrains monetary policy to be relatively ‘passive’. However, in simulations we conclude that the central bank does not need to seek, on this account, the degree of debt stabilisation that appears to be implied by the fiscal stability pact.

T2  - Journal of Monetary Economics
AB  - Indeterminacy in new Keynesian models with Calvo-contracts can occur even at low trend inflation levels of 2% or 3%. The interaction of trend inflation with nominal wage rigidity and trend growth in output causes large distortions in the steady state and expands the indeterminacy region. Consequently, even interest rate rules with strong inflation responses may not be sufficient to ensure determinacy. A policy rule reacting to output growth but not to output gap significantly increases the prospect of determinacy. Although the threat of indeterminacy is less severe under Taylor-contracts, significant departures from the original Taylor Principle are required for determinacy.

AB  - This paper estimates a small open economy model for Egypt to analyze inflation, output dynamics and monetary policy during 2005-2010. The interest rate channel is found to be relatively weak in Egypt, complicating the use of interest rates as the immediate target of monetary policy. However, the paper also finds a significant level of persistence in the policy rate, making monetary policy pro-cyclical. More active use of interest rate policy, measures to improve domestic debt markets and a gradual move towards inflation targeting can help support a successful disinflation strategy for Egypt.

AB  - Most euro area countries have entered an unprecedented ageing process: life expectancy continues to rise and fertility rates have declined, while retirement age in the last twenty to thirty years hardly increased. This implies an ever smaller fraction of the working age population in total population, leading to changes in consumption and saving behaviours and having an important impact on the macroeconomy. In this paper we focus on the relationship between demographic change and inflation. We find that based on a cointegrated VAR model there is a positive long-run relationship between inflation and the growth rate of working-age population as a share in total population in the euro area countries as a whole, but also in the US and Germany. We also find that this relation is mitigated by the effect of monetary policy, which we account for by including the short-term interest rate in our analysis. One caveat of the analysis could be that the empirical relationship as found does not sufficiently take into account changes in policy settings following the high inflation experiences in the 1970s. Our findings support the view that demographic trends are among the forces that shape the economic environment in which monetary policy operates. This is particularly relevant for countries, like many in Europe, that face an ageing process. JEL Classification: E31, J11, C22

TI  - Does Inflation Targeting Reduce Inflation? An Analysis for the OECD Industrial Countries
AU  - Wu, Thomas Y.
T2  - Working Papers Series
AB  - Despite of its popularity, empirical studies have failed to find evidence of the causal effect of a country's adoption of the Inflation Targeting regime on that country's inflation rate decline. This paper applies the multi-period differences-in-differences estimation to the quarterly CPI inflation rates from the first quarter of 1985 until the third quarter of 2002 to the 22 OECD industrial countries and finds two basic sets of results. The first set of evidences is that countries that have officially adopted Inflation Targeting experience a decrease in their average inflation rates that is not only due to a reversion to mean process. The second set of results is that (1) there seems to be no evidence that Inflation Targeting countries experienced a significant increase in the level of their real interest rates after they adopted the new regime and that (2) even after controlling for the level of real interest rates there is still a causal effect from the adoption of Inflation Targeting to the reduction in inflation rates. In other words, the empirical evidence rejects the idea that the better performance in the inflation rates of the Inflation Targeting countries is only due to a more "aggressive" monetary policy.

T2  - Journal of Economic Dynamics and Control
T3  - The Role of Financial Intermediaries in Monetary Policy Transmission
AB  - The global financial crisis has reaffirmed the importance of financial factors for macroeconomic fluctuations. Recent work has shown how the conventional pre-crisis prescription that monetary policy should pay no attention to financial variables over and above their effects on inflation may no longer be valid in models that consider frictions in financial intermediation (Cúrdia and Woodford, 2009). This paper analyzes whether Taylor rules augmented with asset prices and credit can improve upon a standard rule both in terms of macroeconomic stabilization and of agents׳ welfare in a DSGE with both a firms׳ balance-sheet channel and a bank-lending channel and in which the spread between lending and policy rates endogenously depends on banks׳ leverage. The main result is that, even in a model in which financial stability does not represent a distinctive policy objective, leaning-against-the-wind policies are desirable in the case of supply side shocks, while strict inflation targeting and a standard rule are less effective. The gains are amplified if the economy is characterized by high private sector indebtedness. Robustness shows that the interaction between financial frictions and debt-deflation effects is potentially very powerful.

T2  - Economic Modelling
AB  - This paper examines the relationship between inflation and inflation expectations of analysts, business, and trade unions in South Africa during the inflation targeting (IT) regime. We consider inflation expectations based on the Bureau of Economic Research (BER) quarterly survey observed from 2000Q1 to 2013Q1. We estimate inflation expectations of individual agents as the weighted average of lagged inflation and the inflation target. The results indicate that expectations are heterogeneous across agents. Expectations of price setters (business and unions) are closely related to each other and are higher than the upper bound of the official target band, while expectations of analysts are within the target band. In addition, expectations of price setters are somewhat related to lagged inflation and the opposite is true for analysts. The results reveal that the SARB has successfully anchored expectations of analysts but that price setters have not sufficiently used the focal point implicit in the inflation targeting regime. The implication is that the SARB may be pushed to accommodate private agents' expectations.

AB  - Monetary policy in the Philippines has had multiple objectives. Moreover, shifts in money demand and the money multiplier have made base money a less reliable anchor for monetary policy. Hence, on present policies, a steady reduction in inflation is not assured, and changes to the monetary policy framework should be considered. This paper reviews the benefits as well as the constraints of an inflation targeting framework and the necessary preconditions--both in terms of the institutional infrastructure and the appropriate inflation target--for its successful implementation, including the ability to forecast inflation reasonably well over policy-relevant time horizons.

This work evaluates the initial years of the Brazilian experience with inflation-targeting. During the period the inflation rate remained in the targeted range, despite the several external and domestic adverse shocks that hit the Brazilian economy. The new monetary framework proved to be fundamental to enhance transparency and to guide expectations, thus preventing transitory inflation surges to develop into permanent inflation increases.

TI  - How Do European Monetary and Fiscal Authorities Behave?
AU  - Favero, Carlo A.
AB  - The objective of this study is to investigate the behaviour of monetary and fiscal authorities in the Euro area. Our main contribution is joint modeling of behaviour of the two authorities. Our investigation highlights a number of facts. The systematic monetary policies adopted by the non-German authorities in the seventies were not capable of stabilizing inflation. Such results have been achieved in the eighties and the nineties by anchoring more tightly domestic monetary policy to German monetary policy. All the main episodes of expansionary fiscal policy which have occurred in the course of the eighties and the nineties in Europe cannot be explained by the systematic behaviour of fiscal authorities. Stabilization of inflation has been achieved independently from the lack of fiscal discipline. There are important interactions between the two authorities but they depend exclusively on the responses of governments expenditures and receipts to interest rate payments on the public debt.

We show that an alternative specification of monetary policy, in which the interest rate tracks the Wicksellian efficient rate of return as the primary indicator of real activity, fits the U.S. data better than otherwise identical Taylor rules. This result holds for a variety of specifications of the other ingredients of the policy rule, including the output gap, and of private agents׳ behavior.

TI  - Our Perennial Issue: Monetary Policy and Inflation
AU  - Brunner, Karl
AB  - Abstract
The Shadow Open Market Committee warned in its first meeting in September 1973 against our drift into permanent inflation. The Committee's concern was motivated by the repeated failures of our policymaking in 1967,1970 and again in 1972. The monetary authorities abandoned in each case an anti-inflationary policy within less than one year of its initiation. The reversal of monetary policy in the spring of 1972 terminated the gradual decline in the rate of price changes and unleashed a new wave of inflation. From an inflation level below 4% p.a. in the spring of 1972 price movements accelerated to a rate of increase of 10% p.a. measured over the six months ending in the month of our first meeting. The failure was repeated for the fourth time in 1976/77. Inflation had been lowered to 4.5% p.a. in the second half of 1976 as a result of the financial policies pursued in 1974/75. The SOMC recommended at the time that the prevailing course in monetary growth be maintained with a gradual decline of the growth rate over subsequent years. The adoption of our recommendation would have lowered the rate of inflation by this time to at most 3% p.a. and most probably to a lower level.

AB  - This paper presents a theoretical framework that allows a decomposition of 'surprises' along the yield curve at the time of monetary policy changes. These surprises can be decomposed into news about policy variables and news about policy preferences, depending on where along the yield curve these surprises occur. On this interpretation, news about policy variables shows up in movements at the short end of the yield curve and is a signal of imperfect monetary policy transparency. News about policy preferences shows up in movements at the long end of the yield curve and is a signal of imperfect monetary policy credibility.

TI  - Assessing the Effectiveness of the Monetary Policy Instrument during the Inflation Targeting Period in South Africa
AU  - Bonga-Bonga, Lumengo
T2  - International Journal of Economics and Financial Issues
AB  - Since the adoption of inflation rate targeting policy, there has been a great concern on the effectiveness of the monetary policy instrument to curb inflation in South Africa. The effectiveness of monetary policy instruments to control the level of inflation has been widely criticised not only in the South African context but also internationally. This paper assesses how inflation react to monetary policy shocks in South Africa during the inflation targeting period by making use of the structural vector error correction model (SVECM). The results of the impulse response function obtained from the SVECM show that, on average, contractionary monetary policy that intends to curb inflationary pressure has been impotent in South Africa. However, the contractionary monetary policy shocks managed to reduce output. The paper suggests that it is time a dual target, inflation and output, be considered in South Africa to avoid the harm caused on output growth from monetary policy actions related to the constraint of inflation targeting.

TI  - The Pressures on American Monetary Policy
AU  - Havrilesky, Thomas
AB  - The basic motivation for this book is my lifelong interest in the relationship between political processes and macroeconomic outcomes, especially in the area of monetary policy. Nowadays, monetary policy is an area where political considerations are believed by scholars to regularly impact upon economic results. In contrast, when my interest in this subject began thirty years ago, the scholarly literature on monetary policy hardly ever mentioned systematic political influences. My dissertation at the University of Illinois in 1966 and my first article (in the Joumal of Political Economy in 1967) addressed the modeling and estimation of the concerns that propel monetary policy. In the political and economic turbulence of the period from the late 1960s through the early 1980s, it became clear that the directions taken by monetary policy were changing with some frequency. My research during that period dealt with models of monetary policy. In attempting to measure these changes, it suggested that monetary policy reactions to the state of the economy were not stable over time. During this period I became interested in reforms which might reduce the resulting instability in the economy. For example, my 1972 article in the Joumal of Political Economy suggested systematic penalties Federal Reserve officials who failed to meet the goal of monetary stability by tying their budgets or salaries inversely to the rate of inflation.

TI  - Domestic Political Sources of American Monetary Policy: 1955-82
AU  - Beck, Nathaniel
T2  - The Journal of Politics
AB  - This study investigates what domestic political factors affect monetary policy in the United States. Monetary policy is measured by changes in adjusted bank reserves. A reaction function is estimated using quarterly data for 1955-82. Independent economic variables in the reaction function are current and expected inflation, slackness, international reserves, the balance of payments, and the high employment surplus. Political variables examined are elections, party, administration, and the relationship between monetary and fiscal policy. Elections do not affect Fed policy. Monetary policy is easier under Democratic presidents; the Kennedy and Nixon administrations do not fit this general pattern. The effect of party and administration is linear; neither party nor administration affects the relationship between the state of the economy and Fed policy. Monetary and fiscal policy covaried during the 1960s; by the 1970s easy fiscal and tight monetary policy became more common.

T2  - International Journal of Monetary Economics and Finance
AB  - This study investigates whether the South African inflation-targeting (IT) framework has performed the role of the nominal anchor and the process through which the monetary authority determines its instrument in the economy. The study employs generalised method of moments (GMM) estimators. The results of the post-IT adoption and full sample periods are characterised by forward-looking IT rule. Furthermore, the paper uses the augmented monetary policy rule to identify the factors that determine the monetary policy instrument for South Africa. The results confirm that the South African monetary economy practised full-fledged IT principle immediately after the adoption of the IT framework and the monetary policy rule serves as a nominal anchor for the economy. The policy implication is that for South Africa to continue keeping inflation to the required single-digit target, the Reserve Bank should further strengthen the IT framework adopted in the economy.

AB  - The People's Bank of China (PBC) has made great strides in modernizing its monetary policy frameworks but their effectiveness will diminish as the sophistication of the economy increases. Empirical evidence supports maintaining a reference to money in China's monetary strategy and enhancing the role of interest rates in its conduct. We advocate adoption of an eclectic strategy involving the monitoring of several indicators, and of a short-term interest rate as the operational target. The PBC should be granted discretion to change its policy rate, and there are no technical obstacles for such a move to occur in the near future.

TI  - The impact of exchange rate volatility on inflation targeting monetary policy in emerging and advanced economies
AU  - Keefe, Helena Glebocki
T2  - International Finance
AB  - Exchange rate volatility is a stated concern for policymakers in many emerging market economies. This paper investigates whether exchange rate volatility impacts the commitment to inflation targeting monetary policy by analyzing thirteen emerging market economies and nine advanced economies from 2000 to 2016. Using a dynamic panel threshold regression model, the response of the domestic target interest rate to the inflation gap, output gap, and exchange rate condition is tested in scenarios of above-threshold and below-threshold exchange rate volatility. Both emerging and advanced economies adhere to their inflation targeting commitments when exchange rate volatility is below 1%, but are unable or unwilling to respond to deviations in the inflation gap when volatility is beyond this threshold value.

AB  - Christina and David Romer's paper ‘Does Monetary Policy Matter?’ advocates the so-called ‘narrative’ approach to causal inference. We demonstrate that this method will not sustain causal inference. First, it is impossible to distinguish monetary shocks from oil shocks as causes of recessions. Second, a world in which the Fed only announces intentions to act cannot be distinguished from one in which it in fact acts. Third, the techniques of dynamic simulation used in the Romers' study are inappropriate and quantitatively misleading. And, finally, their approach provides no basis for establishing causal asymmetry.

As individuals are allowed to exchange information on their personal mood and to persuade each other through repeated interactions, waves of optimism and pessimism emerge endogenously. The model is then used to analyze the stabilizing effect of alternative monetary policy rules.

T2  - European Economic Review
AB  - This paper reports estimates of monetary policy reaction functions for two sets of countries: the G3 (Germany, Japan, and the US) and the E3 (UK, France, and Italy). We find that since 1979 each of the G3 central banks has pursued an implicit form of inflation targeting, which may account for the broad success of monetary policy in those countries over this time period. The evidence also suggests that these central banks have been forward looking: they respond to anticipated inflation as opposed to lagged inflation. As for the E3, even prior to the emergence of the `hard ERM', the E3 central banks were heavily influenced by German monetary policy. Further, using the Bundesbank's policy rule as a benchmark, we find that at the time of the EMS collapse, interest rates in each of the E3 countries were much higher than domestic macroeconomic conditions warranted. Taken all together, the results lend support to the view that some form of inflation targeting may be superior to fixing exchange rates, as a means to gain a nominal anchor for monetary policy.

AB  - This paper tackles the monetary policy performance in Brazil, Chile and South Africa under inflation targeting framework. Furthermore, it provides an empirical assessment through using the unrestricted Vector Auto-regression (VAR) and Structural Vector Auto-regression (SVAR) approaches depending on data spans the period from the first quarter of 1970 to the fourth quarter of 2007. On the other hand, it utilizes the Likelihood Ratio (LR) Statistic to test for possible structural changes due to the adoption of inflation targeting regime in those countries. The main findings are as follows: inflation targeting does make a difference in the performance of monetary policy in those countries. Furthermore, the experience of Brazil, Chile and South Africa provides important lessons for other emerging market economies to adopt such a framework.

AB  - Fiscal and Monetary Policy in a Monetary Union: Credible Inflation Targets or Monetized Debt? —The paper examines the interrelationship between fiscal and monetary policy in a two-country monetary union. The worst scenario occurs when an independent central bank sets the nominal interest rate and responds to rising government debt/GDP ratios by monetization. The result is high inflation, high debt/GDP ratios and a large public sector. Government debt and inflation are contained if the governments bear sole responsibility for solvency, but the public sector remains excessively large. The best scenario occurs if the central bank removes the incentive for the governments to engineer surprise inflation by credible inflation targeting.

TI  - Fiscal Dominance and Inflation Targeting: Lessons from Brazil
AU  - Blanchard, Olivier
AB  - A standard proposition in open-economy macroeconomics is that a central-bank-engineered increase in the real interest rate makes domestic government debt more attractive and leads to a real appreciation. If, however, the increase in the real interest rate also increases the probability of default on the debt, the effect may be instead to make domestic government debt less attractive, and to lead to a real depreciation. That outcome is more likely the higher the initial level of debt, the higher the proportion of foreign-currency-denominated debt, and the higher the price of risk. Under that outcome, inflation targeting can clearly have perverse effects: An increase in the real interest in response to higher inflation leads to a real depreciation. The real depreciation leads in turn to a further increase in inflation. In this case, fiscal policy, not monetary policy, is the right instrument to decrease inflation. This paper argues that this is the situation the Brazilian economy found itself in in 2002 and 2003. It presents a model of the interaction between the interest rate, the exchange rate, and the probability of default, in a high-debt high-risk-aversion economy such as Brazil during that period. It then estimates the model, using Brazilian data. It concludes that, in 2002, the level and the composition of public debt in Brazil, and the general level of risk aversion in world financial markets, were indeed such as to imply perverse effects of the interest rate on the exchange rate and on inflation.

T2  - African Journal of Economic and Management Studies
AB  - Purpose The sharp rise in non-performing loans (NPLs) with its associated effect on financial institutions in Ghana has become very alarming. This has led to the collapse of distressed institutions and associated repercussions such as loss of private savings, investments, businesses and livelihoods. The purpose of this paper is to test the hypothesis that the monetary policy rate can be used to influence NPLs in Ghana. Design/methodology/approach Using quarterly data spanning from 2000 to 2016, the authors used the autoregressive distributed lag econometric approach to estimate the effect of monetary policy on the percentage growth of NPLs in Ghana. The results are presented for both short-run and long-run periods. Findings In the short run, the authors find evidence of no statistically significant effect of monetary policy on the percentage growth of NPLs. However, in the long run, the authors find a statistically significant effect of monetary policy on the percentage growth of NPLs. Practical implications The authors recommend that policymakers should focus on building a strong financial environment, so that monetary policy can be used to influence the commercial bank’s interest rate. In effect, this will help reduce the growth of NPLs, reduce risk and attract competitors into the financial market, increase asset base, increase credit to support viable ventures and subsequently boost economic growth in Ghana. Originality/value The paper shows its value by using quarterly data whereas most literature have considered annual data. Also, the paper includes a policy variable measured by the Monetary Policy Rate (MPR) as the key variable of interest which is normally not the case with most studies.

AB  - Purpose – The purpose of this paper is to study if the central bank (BC) communications affect the effectiveness of the monetary policy. Design/methodology/approach – For this analysis, a new Keynesian theoretical model and the ordinary least squared methodology were used. The objective to be achieved was to determine if there is some effect of economic transparency on accountability, inflation average, output gap, interest and central bank credibility. Findings – The results highlighted that central banks with greater transparency contribute to decrease inflation rate and interest rate. The findings denote that an increase in the information quality (clarity) implies a significant change in the rate of readjustment of market expectations. Furthermore, central bank transparency contributes to anchor the public expectations and to affect long‐run interest rates. Research limitations/implications – Impulse‐answer research was employed to show how the central bank transparency affects the credibility of monetary authorities. Practical implications – This paper suggests that the central bank publicizes its outlook, its policy monetary decisions, its expectations and its preferences. Originality/value – The originality of the paper resides in the fact that empirical and theoretical studies were made in the single work. Also, new results were found denoting that economic transparency reduces uncertainty effect and increases the power of incentive contract made between the BC and public.

In both cases, the hypothesis is found wanting: groups are not slower than individuals. In both experiments, we also find that group decisions are on average better than individual decisions. This holds regardless of whether the groups make decisions by unanimity or majority rule. Simple mechanical theories of group decisionmaking-that the group follows its average player, median player, or best player-do not explain the results. Group interactions seem to matter.

AB  - We estimate how US monetary policies, namely the current fed funds rate, forward guidance, and large-scale asset purchases, affect inflation. The effect of large-scale asset purchases on inflation is found to be much smaller than the other policies and can have the opposite sign in the short run. This difference is accounted for by the responses of fiscal policy. While fiscal policy is eased in response to monetary tightening in the short run, the long-term fiscal consolidation is less intense under unconventional monetary policies.

We show that the second-order approximation to the welfare of the representative agent depends on inflation and "gaps" that involve current and lagged unemployment. Our approximation makes explicit how welfare costs are generated by the presence of search frictions. These costs are distinct from the costs associated with relative price dispersion and fluctuations in consumption that appear in standard new
Keynesian models. We show the labor market structure has important implications for optimal monetary policy. (JEL E24, E31, E52)

AU  - Güney, Pelin Öge
T2  - Central Bank Review
AB  - This paper investigates the role of inflation and output uncertainties on monetary policy rules in Turkey for the period 2002:01–2014:02. In the literature it is suggested that uncertainty is a key element in monetary policy, hence empirical models of monetary policy should regard to uncertainty. In this study, we estimate a forward-looking monetary reaction function of the Central Bank of the Republic of Turkey (CBRT). In addition to inflation and output gap variables, our reaction function also includes both the inflation and output growth uncertainties. Our results suggest that the Central Bank of the Republic of Turkey (CBRT) concerns with mainly price stability and significantly responds to inflation and growth uncertainties.

TI  - Stock returns and inflation: The role of the monetary sector
AU  - Kaul, Gautam
T2  - Journal of Financial Economics
AB  - This paper hypothesizes that the relation between stock returns and inflation is caused by the equilibrium process in the monetary sector. More importantly, these relations vary over time in a systematic manner depending on the influence of money demand and supply factors. Post-war evidence from the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom and Germany indicates that the negative stock return-inflation relations are caused by money demand and counter-cyclical money supply effects. On the other hand, pro-cyclical movements in money, inflation, and stock prices during the 1930's lead to relations which are either positive or insignificant.

AB  - Yes, they would. In a randomized control trial, we provide groups of respondents from the Bundesbank Online Panel Households with information about a hypothetical alternative ECB monetary policy regime akin to the Federal Reserve’s flexible average inflation targeting (AIT). Inflation expectations significantly increase for the treated individuals. When we provide additional information about near-term inflation, for low levels of trust in the ECB the adjustment of inflation expectations tends to be negative while it is positive for intermediate and higher levels of trust. We assess the economic significance of our findings by comparing two model economies under different monetary policy strategies, calibrated to match the difference in medium-term inflation expectations from our survey results. Under AIT, inflation is substantially less volatile and the frequency of hitting the lower bound on interest rates is considerably reduced.

TI  - The Great Inflation of the Seventies: What Really Happened?
AU  - Nelson, Edward
T2  - Topics in Macroeconomics
AB  - This paper revisits the issue of what factors produced the macroeconomic policies that led to the Great Inflation of the 1970s. I emphasize that a satisfactory explanation should satisfy two important criteria. First, it must be consistent with the record of views on the economy, manifested in statements by policymakers and prominent financial commentators. Second, it should work for countries beside the United States. I show that the monetary policy neglect hypothesis–which claims that policymakers took a nonmonetary view of the inflation process–meets these criteria. Other explanations of the Great Inflation are ruled out, with one exception (the output gap mismeasurement hypothesis), which supplements the monetary policy neglect hypothesis. The study covers the Great Inflation in both the United Kingdom and the United States, with policymakers’ views on the economy documented using 1970s news reports.

AB  - One of the main goals of state intervention is to maintain price stability. There is no doubt that active use of monetary policy instruments (exchange rates, money supply, interest rate) has a significant effect on inflation. The most important monetary instrument for stopping inflation is money supply and its control. Therefore, interventions to increase liquidity in the economic circuit must be made with great caution. In this context, in this study we sought to achieve the most important problems related to inflation rate that exists in Romania.

T2  - Working Papers
AB  - This paper attempts to provide some facts about the current environment where inflation seems to be originating from supply-side factors. It aims in particular to answer whether or not there is a role for monetary policy to contain such inflation and, if yes, how. From this study, it is found that in the past Thailand’s inflation dynamics were largely governed by temporary supply disruptions whose effects on inflation tended to quickly disappear on their own, unless assisted by some other factors such as accommodative monetary policy. During the past five years, however, the nature of these supply shocks has changed in line with the structural shifts in the demand and supply of oil and farm products. As a result, changes in oil and farm prices have themselves become more protracted. Under the circumstance, accommodative monetary policy could keep the impact of supply shocks on inflation even more lasting, and thus the inflation process could become more persistent as well. Therefore, the authorities must maintain high priority on monetary policy discipline and be mindful that persistently high inflation expectations could cause people to become inflation tolerant and ultimately allow inflation to stay high over an extended horizon.

AB  - This paper examines the response of the term structure of interest rates to weekly money announcements. Estimated responses for both the pre- and post-October 1979 periods are first presented. Then, two competing hypotheses involving the policy anticipations and expected inflation effects are formally specified and compared with the estimated responses. Both hypotheses are found to be consistent with the responses, but they have sharply different implications about the Federal Reserve's short-run monetary policy. By exploiting these different implications, additional empirical results focusing directly on the money stock process support the policy anticipations hypothesis.

AU  - Green, John H.
T2  - Staff Papers
AB  - As with many monetary policy frameworks, inflation targeting is subject to the well-known problem of inflation bias. With inflation targeting, however, the bias becomes apparent not as inflation above desired levels but as a wedge between the announced target and observed inflation. This inconsistency could render the framework neither credible nor enforceable because the target is overshot on average. The problem can be addressed by assigning price stability as the single policy objective or by assigning dual targets for inflation and output, provided that they are consistent. Many inflation-targeting countries take the joint target approach implicitly through transparency measures that publicly assess monetary conditions in terms of potential output and output gaps.

AB  - The paper discusses the role of fiscal policy as an instrument for macroeconomic stabilisation when monetary policy pursues inflation targeting. Within a theoretical model of an open economy with a traded and non-traded sector, we show that inflation targeting may lead to large sectoral imbalances when fiscal policy is passive. There is a potentially large welfare gain from an active fiscal policy, in particular when sectoral stability is included in the welfare function. However, with reasonable parameter values, a small cost of adjusting fiscal policy reduces the optimal degree of activism considerably. The reason is that a given change in output requires a large change in the fiscal policy stance under inflation targeting, because of the monetary policy reaction function.

AB  - Have conventional monetary policy instruments maintained the same ability to accommodate undesirable effects of shocks throughout the postwar period? Or has the changed economic environment characterizing the last 30 years diminished the sensitivity of macroeconomic volatility to systematic changes in the conduct of monetary policy? The answer is no to the first question and, consequently, yes to the second question. We estimate a medium-scale New-Keynesian model in two subsamples, 1955–79 and 1984–2012, and find that the sensitivity of inflation variance to changes in conventional monetary policy has declined. We document that the changed properties of the labour market largely contributed to this decline.

T2  - The B.E. Journal of Macroeconomics
AB  - Using data from U.S. states, this paper examines empirically how the effects of monetary policy on output depend on banking conditions. I find that when a state’s banking sector starts out with a low capital-asset ratio, its subsequent lending and output growth are both more sensitive to changes in the federal funds rate or other indicators of monetary policy. This result is consistent with the existence of a ‘bank capital channel’ as well as a conventional bank lending channel. Other evidence favors the capital channel, as bank liquidity is not associated with variation in the impact of monetary policy on output at the state level. Consistent with the theory, the importance of state-level measures of bank capital weakens significantly after the removal of regulatory barriers to interstate banking.

TI  - Does money matter in Africa? New empirics on long- and short-run effects of monetary policy on output and prices
AU  - A. Asongu, Simplice
T2  - Indian Growth and Development Review
AB  - Purpose The purpose of this paper is to examine the effects of monetary policy on economic activity using a plethora of hitherto unemployed financial dynamics in inflation-chaotic African countries for the period of 1987-2010.Although in developed economies, changes in monetary policy affect real economic activity in the short-run, but only prices in the long-run, the question of whether these tendencies apply to developing countries remains open to debate. Design/methodology/approach Vector autoregresion (VARs) within the frameworks of Vector Error Correction Models and simple Granger causality models are used to estimate the long- and short-run effects, respectively. A battery of robustness checks are also used to ensure consistency in the specifications and results. Findings The tested hypotheses are valid under monetary policy independence and dependence, except few exceptions. H1: Monetary policy variables affect prices in the long-run but not in the short-run. For the first-half (long-run dimension) of the hypothesis, permanent changes in monetary policy variables (depth, efficiency, activity and size) affect permanent variations in prices in the long-term. But in cases of disequilibriums, only financial dynamic fundamentals of depth and size significantly adjust inflation to the cointegration relations. With respect to the second-half (short-run view) of the hypothesis, monetary policy does not overwhelmingly affect prices in the short-term. Hence, but for a thin exception, H1 is valid. H2: Monetary policy variables influence output in the short-term but not in the long-term. With regard to the short-term dimension of the hypothesis, only financial dynamics of depth and size affect real gross domestic product output in the short-run. As concerns the long-run dimension, the neutrality of monetary policy has been confirmed. Hence, the hypothesis is also broadly valid. Practical implications A wide range of policy implications are discussed. Inter alia: the long-run neutrality of money and business cycles, credit expansions and inflationary tendencies, inflation targeting and monetary policy independence implications. Country-/regional-specific implications, the manner in which the findings reconcile the ongoing debate, measures for fighting surplus liquidity and caveats and future research directions are also discussed. Originality/value By using a plethora of hitherto unemployed financial dynamics (that broadly reflect monetary policy), we provide significant contributions to the empirics of money. The conclusion of the analysis is a valuable contribution to the scholarly and policy debate on how money matters as an instrument of economic activity in developing countries.

AB  - This article investigates the relationship between inﬂation and output, in the data and in standard models. The article reports that empirical cross-country studies generally ﬁnd a nonlinear, negative relationship between inﬂation and output, a relationship that standard models cannot come close to reproducing. The article demonstrates that the models’ problem may be due to their standard narrow assumption that all money is held by the public for making transactions. When the models are adjusted to also assume that banks are required to hold money, the models do a much better job. The article concludes that researchers interested in studying the effects of monetary policy on growth should shift their attention away from printing money and toward the study of banking and ﬁnancial regulations.

TI  - The Industry Effects of Monetary Policy in the Euro Area
AU  - Peersman, Gert
AU  - Smets, Frank
T2  - The Economic Journal
AB  - We first estimate the effects of a euro area‐wide monetary policy change on output growth in eleven industries of seven euro area countries over the period 1980–98. On average the negative effect of an interest rate tightening on output is significantly greater in recessions than in booms. There is, however, considerable cross‐industry heterogeneity in both the overall policy effects and the degree of asymmetry across the two business cycle phases. We then explore which industry characteristics can account for this cross‐industry heterogeneity. Differences in the overall policy effects can mainly be explained by the durability of the goods produced in the sector. This can be regarded as evidence for the conventional interest rate/cost‐of‐capital channel. In contrast, differences in the degree of asymmetry of policy effects are related to differences in financial structure, in particular the maturity structure of debt, the coverage ratio, financial leverage and firm size. This suggests that financial accelerator mechanisms can partly explain cross‐industry differences in asymmetry.

We then extend our previous work by expanding the sample period and identifying an additional policy shift in December 1988. With this extension, the estimated effects of monetary policy shifts are large and highly significant for all reasonable specifications of oil shocks. We also demonstrate that Hoover and Perez's other objections have little bearing on our conclusions.

T2  - Reserve Bank of New Zealand Bulletin
AB  - This article looks at how interest rates and inflation affect growth in the capital stock, labour supply, and technology, the main determinants of long-run economic growth. Many additional factors affect long-run economic growth, but most of these factors lie outside the sphere of monetary policy. Monetary policy therefore has only a limited capacity to contribute to economic growth over the longer term. However, the evidence does indicate that keeping inflation low and stable makes a positive contribution to long-run economic growth, and that this is the most effective contribution that monetary policy can make to the economy's performance over time. This finding supports the monetary policy framework operational in New Zealand, which is focused on keeping inflation between 1 and 3 per cent on average over the medium term.

T2  - Economic Inquiry
AB  - This article presents a dynamic stochastic new Keynesian model with real balance effects. I find a number of results that would not appear in the traditional framework. It is shown that the real balance effect makes the so-called Taylor principle not necessary for determinacy of rational expectations equilibrium and that “passive” monetary rules may be feasible. In addition, within a class of policy rules constrained to be a linear function of state variables, “active” interest rate rules are more likely to be optimal under commitment rather than under discretion.

AB  - Given the importance of output growth in Nigeria and the need for monetary policy decisions to be guided by the knowledge of the asymmetric effects of positive and negative monetary policy shocks, this study investigates the asymmetric effects of monetary policy shocks on output growth in Nigeria using quarterly data from 1981Q1 to 2018Q4. The study employs the recently developed Lee and Strazicich unit root test with structural breaks, Nonlinear ARDL, and the Hatemi-J causality tests. The result reveals the presence of long-run and short-run asymmetries in the effect of monetary policy shocks on output growth in Nigeria. The results of the long-run effect show that both positive and negative monetary policy rate shocks have positive, elastic, and statistically significant effect on output growth. For the short-run, the results indicate that the effect of negative monetary policy shocks dominate the effects of positive monetary policy rate shocks, while the effect of positive money supply shocks dominates the effect of negative money supply shocks. Furthermore, the study finds evidence in support of the expansionary monetary policy in the long-run. Hence, the recommendations for expansionary monetary policy decision to enhance output growth.

AB  - We estimate a time-varying coefficient VAR model for the US economy to analyse (i) if the effect of monetary policy on output has been changing systematically over time, and (ii) if monetary policy has asymmetric effects over the business cycle. We find that the impact of monetary policy shocks has been gradually declining over the sample period (1962 to 2002), as some theories of the monetary transmission mechanism imply. In addition, our results indicate that the effects of monetary policy are greater in a recession than in a boom.

TI  - Effects of Anticipated and Unanticipated Monetary Policy on Output in Nigeria
AU  - Ajisafe, Rufus A.

T2  - African Journal of Economic Review
AB  - Controversy abounds in both theoretical and empirical literature on the relative importance, and the real effects of anticipated and unanticipated monetary policy on output. Early authors argue that outputs are affected only by unanticipated monetary policy shocks while Keynesian theorists believe in the efficacy of the anticipated monetary policy shocks to orchestrate real effects on the economy. On this backdrop, this present study examines the effects of anticipated and unanticipated monetary policy on output in Nigeria using annual secondary data from 1986 to 2020. The study employs Autoregressive Distributed Lag (ARDL) model to estimate how anticipated and unanticipated monetary policy affects output in Nigeria. Our results show that there exists a long run level relationship among anticipated and unanticipated monetary policy and output in Nigeria. The results also show that the effect of anticipated monetary policy is neutral on output while unanticipated monetary policy has a significant positive effect on output. Therefore, the study aligns with the rational expectation theory that only the unanticipated monetary shocks affect the real economy.

TI  - Financial globalisation and monetary policy effectiveness
AU  - Georgiadis, Georgios

AB  - In theory financial globalisation has an ambiguous effect on monetary policy effectiveness. On the one hand, exposure to global financial cycles dampens the output effect of a tightening in monetary policy in financially integrated economies and thereby reduces monetary policy effectiveness. On the other hand, another salient feature of financial globalisation is that economies have become increasingly net long in foreign currency, which amplifies monetary policy effectiveness: economies experience larger valuation losses and wealth effects on their external balance sheets in response to an exchange rate appreciation when monetary policy is tightened, hence triggering stronger output effects. We quantify empirically the net impact of financial globalisation on monetary policy effectiveness through these two opposing channels. We find that since the 1990s the second channel has dominated so that financial globalisation has amplified monetary policy effectiveness in the typical advanced and emerging market economy. By our estimates, the output effect of a tightening in monetary policy has increased by 25% due to financial globalisation. Our results imply that financial globalisation has modified the transmission of monetary policy by strengthening the importance of the exchange rate channel.

TI  - The Effect of Monetary Policy on Private Sector Investment in Kenya
AU  - Olweny, Tobias
AU  - Chiluwe, Mambo
AB  - The study explores the relationship between monetary policy and private sector
investment in Kenya by tracing the effects of monetary policy through the
transmission mechanism to explain how investment responded to changes in
monetary. Several studies have offered a means to understand the manner in
which monetary policy actions affect investment, prominent among them are the
Classical school, Majumder (2007), the Keynesian, Barro (1997), and recently the
Credit Channel Approach, Kahn (2010), Bernanke and Gertler (1995). The study
utilises quarterly macroeconomic data from 1996 to 2009 and the methodology
draws upon unit roots and cointegration testing using a vector error correction
model to explore the dynamic relationship of short run and long run effects of the
variables due to an exogenous shock. The variables are stationary in first
differences and using ordinary least squares the estimated long run relationship is:
LRPSC = 1.84 - 0.54LRGDD + 0.62LRGDS + 0.75LRMS - 0.04LTBILL  Implying that government domestic debt and Treasury bill rate are inversely
related to private sector investment, while money supply and domestic savings
have positive relationship with private sector investment consistent with the
IS-LM model. Based on the empirical results the study suggests that tightening of
monetary policy by -1 percent has the effect of reducing investment by -2.63 while
the opposite loose monetary policy tends to increase investment by 2.63.The error
correction term (ECT) of -0.55 is negatively signed indicating a move back to
equilibrium suggesting that following an exogenous shock, 55 percent of the
disequilibrium is corrected after one quarter.

TI  - Efficient Rules for Monetary Policy
AU  - Ball, Laurence
T2  - International Finance
AB  - This paper defines an efficient rule for monetary policy as one that minimizes a weighted sum of output variance and inflation variance. It derives several results about the efficiency of alternative rules in a simple macroeconomic model. First, efficient rules can be expressed as ‘Taylor rules’ in which interest rates respond to output and inflation. But the coefficients in efficient Taylor rules differ from the coefficients that fit actual policy in the United States. Second, inflation targets are efficient. Indeed, the set of efficient rules is equivalent to the set of inflation-target policies with different speeds of adjustment. Finally, nominal-income targets are highly inefficient: they create great volatility in both inflation and output.

AB  - In this paper, I present empirical evidence for …ve European countries (Germany, France, UK, Spain and Italy) and the Euro-zone on whether monetary policy shocks produce diferent ejects on real output growth depending on the phase of the business cycle that the economy is undergoing (the socalled ´state´ asymmetry). To do so, I apply a multivariate extension of the Hamilton(1989)´s Markov switching methodology. I …nd evidence in favour of ´state´ asymmetries at the aggregate level in all the countries whereby interest-rate shocks have larger e¤ects in recessions than in expansions. I also carry out the analysis at the sectorial level and observe that this asymmetric effect seems to be diferent in the analysed countries when I focus on a sectorial analysis.
