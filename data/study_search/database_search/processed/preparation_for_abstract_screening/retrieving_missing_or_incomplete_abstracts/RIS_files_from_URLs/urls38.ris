AB  - The agricultural sector in Eswatini is viewed as an engine to foster economic growth, reduce poverty and eradicate inequality. The purpose of the study was to investigate the effects of monetary policy on the agriculture Gross Domestic Product (GDP) in Eswatini using annual data for the period starting from 1980 to 2016. Using the Vector Error Correction model (VEC), the empirical results indicated that in the long run, agriculture GDP, exchange rate, interest rate, inflation, broad money supply, and agriculture credit have a negative effect on agriculture GDP in Eswatini. In the short run the study indicated that the variation in agriculture GDP is largely significant caused by the lagged agricultural GDP, interest rate, exchange rate as well as inflation. Money supply and agriculture credit contribute 0.46% and 0.55%, respectively to the variation in agricultural GDP. The study recommends that programs aimed at availing affordable credit to farmers should be prioritized to cushion the agriculture sector against adverse monetary policy shocks in the short to medium term, specifically interest rates, to ensure continuous production.

AB  - This paper investigates the relationship between financial development and the effectiveness of monetary policy using panel data from 41 economies. The results show that the effects of monetary policy on output and inflation are significantly and negatively correlated with financial development, indicating that the effectiveness of monetary policy declines as the financial system becomes more developed. This finding is robust across all the different specifications and estimation methods examined. Our paper provides new evidence and insights to the long-standing debate on the relationship between financial development and the effectiveness of monetary policy.

AB  - This paper investigates regime switching in the response of U.S. output to a monetary policy action. We find substantial, statistically significant, time variation in this response that corresponds to "high response" and "low response" regimes. We then investigate whether the timing of the regime shifts are consistent with three particular manifestations of asymmetry by modeling the transition probabilities governing the switching process as functions of state variables. We find strong evidence that policy actions taken during recessions have larger effects than those taken during expansions. We find less evidence of asymmetry related to the direction or size of the policy action.

AB  - This paper investigates the macroeconomic effects of monetary and fiscal policies in three South Eastern European economies: Bulgaria, Croatia and Macedonia. We employ recursive vector autoregressions in order to study the linkages among fiscal policy, monetary policy and economic activity based on quarterly data on primary cyclically adjusted balance, monetary policy indicators, inflation rate and output gap. We obtain the following main results: first, domestic economic activity exerts significant effects on inflation, provoking a strong reaction of monetary policy, especially in case of procyclical or erratic behavior of fiscal policy; second, we find evidence for the expansionary effects of fiscal consolidation since fiscal tightening leads to an increase in economic activity; third, the effects of monetary policy on output and inflation are generally as expected; fourth, monetary policy acts as a strategic substitute to tight fiscal policy, while in case of monetary tightening, fiscal authorities behave in a countercyclical manner.

AB  - This paper raises doubts about the proposition that monetary policy is effective, under flexible exchange rates, in stabilizing domestic output. It is argued that if the price elasticities of the demands for exports and imports are affected by the transition to flexible rates, and capital flows are assumed to be dependent on the exchange rate, the efficacy of monetary policy under flexible rates will not necessarily follow.

AB  - This paper has analysed the impact of rising crude oil prices on output. Crude oil prices and real output are found to be strongly related, and this relationship has a bell-shape. That is, when crude oil prices are below the critical level (i.e., 22 $ s/bbl), the relationship between crude oil prices and real output is positive; whereas when the crude oil price rises and exceeds that critical level the relationship becomes negative. Moreover, high debt-GDP ratio, high deficit spending, and high real effective exchange rate would have a negative impact on output. While the existence of foreign exchange reserves and capital investment would cause output to rise.

AB  - This survey provides an updated review of the empirical literature on the regional effects of monetary policy in economic activity by means of undertaking a threefold perspective. First, the main methodological dimensions of this literature are examined while pinpointing those modelling or methodological traits that constitute a source of diverging estimates and thereby produce inconclusive evidence. Secondly, the estimates yielded by the literature are summarized by carrying out a cross-study analysis of the results for each monetary union. By drawing on empirical regularities that are robust across studies, the conclusiveness of the results is assessed, while those monetary unions for which conclusive evidence is still lacking are also identified. Lastly, the sources of regional heterogeneity identified by these studies are reviewed in order to shed some light on the linkage between monetary policy and territorial heterogeneity. As a result of this threefold perspective, this survey delivers overall structured conclusions and updated policy-relevant lessons. Moreover, various research gaps and emerging topics in the literature are also identified.

T2  - The Journal of Economic Asymmetries
AB  - We empirically test the effects of anticipated and unanticipated monetary policy shocks on the growth rate of real industrial production and explicitly test for different types of asymmetries in monetary policy implementation for two major international economies, the U.S. and Brazil. We depart from the conventional method of VAR analysis to estimate unanticipated monetary shocks, and instead, we use a combination of alternative methodologies. We first identify the Taylor rule that best describes the reaction of both central banks and then we test both forward looking linear and nonlinear models. We conclude that a Logistic Smooth Transition Autoregressive (LSTAR) forward looking model of the Taylor rule best describes the US FED Funds rate while a linear Taylor rule with the inclusion of a dummy variable best describes the reaction of the Central Bank of Brazil (BCB). We then use in-sample forecast errors in order to derive and identify the unexpected monetary policy shocks for both countries. In line with Cover (1992), we use these shocks to explore any asymmetries in the conduct of monetary policy on the growth rate of the real industrial production. We also find asymmetries between anticipated and unanticipated monetary shocks as well as between effects of positive and negative shocks.

T2  - Journal of Economic Integration
AB  - Since the inception of EMU, a common concern is that European monetary policy may have differential effects on EMU member countries. However, the reliance on cross-country evidence in the empirical literature risks overemphasizing the importance of cross-country differences in monetary transmission. This paper therefore takes a regional approach. Data from 58 European regions show significant cross-regional differences in the effects of monetary policy within the five largest EU countries. For all regions combined, I find a significant relationship between the impact of monetary policy and the industrial composition of regions, supporting earlier findings for the US. I conclude that at present the large European countries are regionally well-diversified enough to minimize the risk that ECB policy will produce a markedly different impact across countries.

AU  - Pestova, A. A.
T2  - VOPROSY ECONOMIKI
AB  - This paper investigates the influence of monetary policy shocks in Russia on the basic macroeconomic and financial indicators. To identify the shocks of monetary policy, the Bayesian approach to the estimation of vector autoregressions (VARs) is applied, followed by extraction of the unexplained dynamics of monetary policy instruments (shocks) using both recursive identification and sign restrictions approach. The estimates show that the monetary policy shocks, apparently, cannot be attributed to the key drivers of cyclical movements in Russia, as they explain only less than 10% of the output variation and from 5 to 10% of the prices variation. When applying recursive identification, no restraining effect of monetary policy on prices is found. Respective impact on output is negative and statistically significant in all identification procedures employed; however, the relative contribution of monetary shocks to output is not large. In addition, no significant effect of monetary policy tightening on the stabilization of the ruble exchange rate was found.

AB  - This paper uses the historical record to isolate episodes in which there were large monetary disturbances not caused by output fluctuations. It then tests whether these monetary changes have important real effects. The central part of the paper is a study of postwar U.S. monetary history. We identify six episodes in which the Federal Reserve in effect decided to attempt to create a recession to reduce inflation. We find that a shift to anti-inflationary policy led, on average, to a rise in the unemployment rate of two percentage points, and that this effect is highly statistically significant and robust to a variety of changes in specification. We reach three other major conclusions. First, the real effects of these monetary disturbances are highly persistent. Second, the six shocks that we identify account for a considerable fraction of postwar economic fluctuations. And third, evidence from the interwar era also suggests that monetary disturbances have large real effects.

TI  - Monetary Policy, Land Prices, and Collateral Effects on Economic Fluctuations: Evidence from Japan
AU  - Kwon, Eunkyung
T2  - Journal of the Japanese and International Economies
AB  - This paper attempts to analyze empirically how impact on collateral values can magnify effects of monetary tightening on the economy. Theoretically, this paper is motivated by “financial accelerator” effects stemming from impacts of monetary policy on financing conditions. In this context, recent economic conditions in Japan deserve our special attention for several reasons. One, a large fraction of business investment financed by bank loans is secured by land. Two, excessively sharp increases in the land dependence of small firms with the asset price inflation in the late 1980s may make a collateral effect bigger, if it exists. Extending existing work to a model with land prices, I find a strong effect of monetary policy on land prices: monetary tightening associated with a rise in the short-term interest rate produces a significant and persistent decline in land prices. I then analyze a role of land prices in the monetary transmission mechanism. Two results are interesting. One, after monetary tightening, output falls. But the impact on output appears more severe and deeper than was predicted in existing studies. Two, the monetary policy shock turns out to be an important source of output variation, as opposed to the findings of existing work in which monetary policy explains output fluctuations very little. The implication is that together with reduced flows of credit after monetary contraction, movements in land prices may play a significant propagating role in the monetary transmission mechanism.J.

AB  - In this paper, we study the role played by central bank communication in monetary policy transmission. We employ the Swiss Economic Institute’s Monetary Policy Communicator to measure the future stance of the European Central Bank’s monetary policy. Our results indicate, first, that communication has an influence on inflation (expectations) similar to that of actual target rate changes. Communication also plays a noticeable role in the transmission of monetary policy to output. Consequently, future work on monetary policy transmission should incorporate both a short-term interest rate and a communication indicator. A second finding is that the monetary policy transmission mechanism changed during the financial crisis as the overall effect of monetary policy on (expected) inflation and output is weaker and of shorter duration during this period compared to the overall sample period.

AB  - Monetary policy comprises the rules and actions adopted by the central bank to achieve its objectives. In most countries the primary goal of monetary policy is price stability. However, the mandate of many central banks also encompasses other objectives, including attainment of fullemployment, domestic financial stability, and normal operation of foreign payments. The priority of price stability over other policy goals tends to be politically accepted in most countries, if not actually enshrined in the laws governing the central bank.

TI  - The Industrial Impact of Monetary Policy Shocks: Some Stylised Facts
AU  - Ganley, Joe
AU  - Salmon, Chris
AB  - This paper investigates the disaggregated effects of monetary policy shocks on the output of 24 sectors of the UK economy. The paper's principal aim is to provide stylised facts about the sectoral responses to unexpected changes in monetary policy and to help assess how monetary policy developments feed through the economy. It also provides indirect evidence about the underlying nature of the transmission mechanism. The first set of results relates to the largest industrial sectors - construction, services, production industries (including utilities and manufacturing) - which sum together to form the output measure of GDP. Thereafter the paper focuses on the manufacturing sector alone. Data sources for manufacturing are richer than for other sectors of the economy, which allows a more detailed analysis of the factors that might account for the pattern of responses to monetary shocks which we observe across manufacturing. Focusing first on the main industrial sectors, the paper finds that the effects of an unanticipated monetary policy tightening seem to be unevenly distributed across sectors of the economy. As might be expected, sectors such as construction show a sizeable and rapid decline in output, whereas others, like services, show a much more muted reaction. Manufacturing as a whole also responds quite sharply to a monetary tightening, but some large industrial sectors, notably the utilities, show a subdued reaction. Turning finally to the manufacturing sector alone, the paper shows that the (2 digit SIC) sectors that comprise manufacturing also exhibit diverse responses to a monetary shock. The paper shows the pattern of manufacturing sector responses seems correlated with the size characteristics of the firms in each sector. In particular, sectors which mainly comprise "small" firms tend to exhibit a stronger reaction to monetary shocks than sectors that mainly comprise "larger" firms. This might indicate that credit market imperfections play a role in the monetary policy transmission process.

TI  - The credit channels of monetary policy transmission: implications on output and employment in Nigeria
AU  - Ltd, ICB-InterConsult Bulgaria
T2  - Banks and Bank Systems
AB  - There has been an increasing trend in the unemployment rate despite the growth rate witnessed. Monetary policy is presumed as one of the ways to improve the situation. Likewise, the relationship between monetary policy and employment has generated controversial debates in the literature. Though its connection has been extensively studied, however, the implications of monetary policy in respect to time frame perspectives on employment and output have not been widely addressed in the literature. This study provides evidence on shock effects, long and short-run impacts of monetary policy transmission through the credit channels on output and employment in Nigeria within the period of 1981 to 2016 using the Structural Vector Autoregression and Autoregressive distributed lags (ARDL). Evidence from the forecast error shock showed that variations in monetary policy indicators affect output more than employment in the first two periods; however, it affects employment more afterwards. The ARDL results show no evidence of co-integration when output is used as the dependent variable; conversely, cointegration exists when employment is used as the dependent variable. The monetary policy indicators: money supply, bank deposit liability and interest rate are statistically and economically significant with employment in the long run. In the short run, money supply and interest rate are economically and statistically significant. The findings revealed that the Nigerian government can maximize the long-run benefits of monetary policy through the credit channels on employment. Hence, there is a need for policymakers to look beyond short-run gain and promote long-run employment via monetary policy among others.

AB  - We explore two issues triggered by the crisis. First, in most advanced countries, output remains far below the pre-recession trend, suggesting hysteresis. Second, while inflation has decreased, it has decreased less than anticipated, suggesting a breakdown of the relation between inflation and activity. To examine the first, we look at 122 recessions over the past 50 years in 23 countries. We find that a high proportion of them have been followed by lower output or even lower growth. To examine the second, we estimate a Phillips curve relation over the past 50 years for 20 countries. We find that the effect of unemployment on inflation, for given expected inflation, decreased until the early 1990s, but has remained roughly stable since then. We draw implications of our findings for monetary policy.

AB  - Bank Indonesia and the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) co-hosted a research conference on "Expanding the boundaries of monetary policy in Asia and the Pacific" on 20-21 August 2015 in Jakarta. The event was the wrap-up conference of a research programme of the BIS Representative Office for Asia and the Pacific that had been approved by the Asian Consultative Council of central bank Governors in February 2014. The topic was motivated by the increased importance of financial stability in the conduct of monetary policy and the expanding set of monetary policy tools being employed. Within this overall theme, the following issues for the Asia-Pacific region were identified: (i) monetary policy objectives and strategies; (ii) instruments to manage monetary conditions; (iii) the assessment of monetary conditions; and (iv) transmission mechanisms. The conference brought together senior officials and researchers from central banks, international organisations and academia. This volume is a collection of the speeches, papers and prepared discussant remarks from the conference. This foreword summarises the contents of the conference and provides a synopsis of the discussions for time-constrained readers

AB  - The idea that the effectiveness of monetary policy measures may depend on the state of the economy is examined for four Asian economies using a generalized Hamilton Markov switching model of output due to Garcia and Schaller (2002). The null hypothesis of symmetry is rejected for these economies and monetary policy is seen to have larger effects during downturns than during upswings.

TI  - The Effect of Adverse Supply Shocks on Monetary Policy and Output

AB  - The aim of the present research is to use a model economy built for Brazil, based on an optimizing dynamic general equilibrium model, in order to perform numerical simulations to derive the ability of the artificial economy to explain the impact of monetary policy interventions on short run economic performance in terms of the inflation rate, output gap, interest rate and level of economic activity in the face of an adverse supply shock. Alternative specification of monetary reaction functions are introduced into the model economy in order to perform a sensitivity analysis of derived impulse responses to those interventions facing the negative productivity shock. The preliminary results suggest that the introduction of habit persistence into the consumption hypothesis does not make much difference. However the introduction of different monetary reaction functions does alter the impulse response of output, inflation rate, and nominal interest rate. A common result is the decline in potential output for all models. Additionally, the only case where a reduction in the output gap is observed is when using the Taylor rule that takes into consideration the output gap and past interest rates with high persistence.

AU  - Pragidis, Ioannis

AU  - Tabak, Benjamin M.
AB  - We empirically test the effects of anticipated and unanticipated monetary policy shocks on the growth rate of real industrial production and explicitly test for different types of asymmetries in monetary policy implementation for two major international economies, the U.S. and Brazil. We depart from the conventional method of VAR analysis to estimate unanticipated monetary shocks and instead we use a combination of other methods. We first identify the Taylor rule that best describes the reaction of both central banks and then we test both forward looking linear and nonlinear models concluding that a Logistic Smooth Transition Autoregressive (LSTAR) forward looking model of the Taylor rule best describes the US FED Funds rate while a linear Taylor rule with the inclusion of a dummy variable best describes the reaction of the Central Bank of Brazil (BCB). We then use in-sample forecast errors in order to derive or identify the unexpected monetary shocks for both countries. In line with Cover (1992), we use these shocks to explore any asymmetries in the conduct of monetary policy on the growth rate of real industrial production. We also find asymmetries between anticipated and unanticipated monetary shocks as well as between effects of positive and negative shocks.

AB  - This paper develops a semi-structural modelling approach to study asymmetric monetary transmission in Europe. A system of dynamic equations containing reaction functions for monetary policy as well as output gap and inflation equations is simultaneously estimated for France, Germany and Italy. We find asymmetries on the demand side in the strength of interest rate transmission and on the supply side in the effects of the output gap on inflation. The responses are similar in Germany and Italy and generally stronger than in France. Out-of-sample tests do not find a structural break in the transmission mechanisms prior to the establishment of the European Monetary Union.

TI  - Are the Eﬀects of Monetary Policy Asymmetric in Australia?
AU  - Bodman, Philip M
AB  - This paper examines whether monetary policy shocks have asymmetric effects on
output in Australia. Using methods similar to Cover (1992) together with some
other simple threshold models, evidence is found of certain types of asymmetries
when comparing monetary contractions to monetary policy expansions.
Unanticipated decreases in interest rates appear to significantly raise GDP
growth rates, whilst unexpected increases in rates do not appear to significantly
lower growth. These findings are also found in a brief examination of the
investment and consumption channels within the monetary policy transmission
process. Economic growth is also significantly higher in a low interest rate regime
(when interest rates are below a certain threshold, such as the sample average or
average over some longer time period) than in a high interest rate environment.
These results appear to refute the idea that monetary policy is like ‘pushing on a
string’, at least for Australian data over the period 1973:1-2005:1.

TI  - Animal spirits and monetary policy
AU  - De Grauwe, Paul
T2  - Economic Theory
AB  - I develop a behavioral macroeconomic model in which agents have cognitive limitations. As a result, they use simple but biased rules (heuristics) to forecast future output and inflation. Although the rules are biased, agents learn from their mistakes in an adaptive way. This model produces endogenous waves of optimism and pessimism (“animal spirits”) that are generated by the correlation of biased beliefs. I identify the conditions under which animal spirits arise. I contrast the dynamics of this model with a stylized DSGE-version of the model and I study the implications for monetary policies. I find that strict inflation targeting is suboptimal because it gives more scope for waves of optimism and pessimism to emerge thereby destabilizing output and inflation.

AU  - Goodhart, Charles

T2  - Applied Economics
AB  - In this paper, the performance of the New Keynesian IS curve for the G7 countries is assessed. It is found that there is an IS puzzle for both the purely backward-looking as well as for the forward-looking IS curve. The real interest rate does not have a significantly negative effect on the output gap. Based on an extended specification of the IS curve, also including asset prices and monetary aggregates, a significantly negative interest rate effect on aggregate demand is found for all countries. This finding suggests that a richer specification of the IS curve in empirical work may be necessary in order to obtain an unbiased estimate of the effect of monetary policy on aggregate demand.

AB  - The paper examines whether monetary policy has similar effects across major states in the Indian polity. Impulse response functions from an estimated Structural Vector Auto Regression (SVAR) reveal two sets of states: a core of states that respond to monetary policy in a significant fashion vis-à-vis others whose response is less significant. The paper attempts to trace the reasons for the differential response of these two sets of states in terms of financial deepening and differential industry mix.

TI  - Monetary Policy and the Well-Being of the Poor
AU  - Romer, Christina D.
AU  - Romer, David H.
AB  - This paper investigates monetary policy's influence on poverty and inequality in both the short run and the long run. We find that the short-run and long-run relationships go in opposite directions. The time-series evidence from the United States shows that a cyclical boom created by expansionary monetary policy is associated with improved conditions for the poor in the short run. The cross-section evidence from a large sample of countries, however, shows that low inflation and stable aggregate demand growth are associated with improved well-being of the poor in the long run. Both the short-run and long-run relationships are quantitatively large, statistically significant, and robust. But because the cyclical effects of monetary policy are inherently temporary, we conclude that monetary policy that aims at low inflation and stable aggregate demand is the most likely to permanently improve conditions for the poor.

AB  - The objective of this study is to determine the impact of monetary policy on real output in China and its provinces using the vector error correction (VEC) method for the 1980–2004 period. It compares and contrasts two alternative indicators of monetary policy — M2 and interest rates. Our findings indicate that the bank lending rate is a better indicator of the direction of monetary policy in China. Using VEC-generated impulse response functions, we find that coastal provinces respond more to shocks in monetary policy than inland provinces. We also determine that the differential provincial responses to monetary policy changes are positively related to the share of loans accounted by industrial firms and to the primary sector’s GDP share. Finally, the percentage of firms that are state-owned (a proxy for the soft budget constraint) has a negative, albeit statistically insignificant, relationship to a province’s response to monetary policy shocks.

AB  - This paper examines monetary transmission in Jordan using the vector autoregressive approach. We find that the real 3-month CD rate, the Central Bank's operating target, affects bank retail rates and that monetary policy, measured by the spread between the 3-month CD rate and the U.S. Federal Funds rate, is effective in influencing foreign reserves. We do not find evidence of monetary policy affecting output. Output responds very little to changes in bank lending rates. Furthermore, equity prices and the exchange rate are not significant channels for transmitting monetary policy to economic activity. The effect of monetary policy on the stock market seems insignificant.

T2  - Journal of Monetary Economics
AB  - We estimate the interdependence between US monetary policy and the S&P 500 using structural vector autoregressive (VAR) methodology. A solution is proposed to the simultaneity problem of identifying monetary and stock price shocks by using a combination of short-run and long-run restrictions that maintains the qualitative properties of a monetary policy shock found in the established literature [Christiano, L.J., Eichenbaum, M., Evans, C.L., 1999. Monetary policy shocks: what have we learned and to what end? In: Taylor, J.B., Woodford, M. (Eds.), Handbook of Macroeconomics, vol. 1A. Elsevier, New York, pp. 65–148]. We find great interdependence between the interest rate setting and real stock prices. Real stock prices immediately fall by seven to nine percent due to a monetary policy shock that raises the federal funds rate by 100 basis points. A stock price shock increasing real stock prices by one percent leads to an increase in the interest rate of close to 4 basis points.

T2  - SSRN Electronic Journal
AB  - Are there limits to how far reductions in interest rates can boost aggregate demand? In particular, as interest rates fall to very low levels, does the effectiveness of monetary policy in boosting the economy wane? We provide evidence consistent with this hypothesis. Based on a panel of 18 advanced countries starting in 1985, we find that monetary transmission to economic activity is substantially weaker when interest rates are low. The results hold even when controlling for potential confounding nonlinearities associated with debt levels and the business cycle as well as for the trend decline in equilibrium interest rates. We also find evidence that the effectiveness of monetary policy wanes the longer interest rates stay low. These findings suggest that the observed flattening of the Phillips curve has gone hand in hand with a corresponding steepening of the IS curve. Monetary policy trade-offs may have become more challenging.

TI  - Institutional Arrangements for Monetary Policy When Output Is Persistent
AU  - Røisland, Øistein
T2  - Journal of Money, Credit and Banking
AB  - A discretionary monetary policy gives rise to a constant average inflation bias, a state-contingent inflation bias, and a stabilization bias when output is persistent. The paper considers institutional arrangements ("contracts") for central banks that remove these policy imperfections. The average and state-contingent inflation biases can be removed by directing the central bank to target the growth of nominal income and appoint a central banker with a specific relative weight attached to output stabilization. An alternative to this institutional solution is to direct central banks to aim for a feasible output target. Although this would remove the inflationary biases, the government must appoint a "liberal" (as opposed to "conservative") central banker in order to implement optimal stabilization.

AU  - Fiordelisi, Franco

AU  - Ricci, Ornella
T2  - Journal of Financial Stability
AB  - Since 2007, monetary authorities around the globe have reduced their key policy interest rates to unprecedented low levels and intervened with non-standard policy measures (i.e., monetary easing and liquidity provision) to support funding conditions for banks, enhance lending to the private sector and contain contagion in financial markets (e.g., European Central Bank, 2011). Using a detailed dataset of monetary policy interventions between June 2007 and June 2012 in the most advanced monetary areas (the Euro area, Japan, the U.S., the UK and Switzerland), we analyze their effects at three different levels, including (1) the interbank credit market, considering the 3-month LIBOR-OIS spread as a measure of financial distress (e.g., Taylor and Williams, 2009); (2) the stock market, represented by wide equity indices; and (3) the banking sector, focusing on global systematically important financial institutions (G-SIFIs). We demonstrate that different monetary policy interventions from single central banks have produced a diverse market reaction. Standard measures have been more effective than non-conventional ones in restoring the interbank market, which is fundamental for maintaining a fully operational traditional interest rate channel and for guaranteeing the normal functioning of financial intermediation. Non-traditional measures have registered a stronger stock market reaction with respect to standard interest rate decisions, both in terms of broad equity indices and single prices of large banks.

AU  - Cecchetti, Stephen G.
AB  - Among the many challenges facing the new Eurosystem is the possibility that the regions of the euro area will respond differently to interest rate changes. In this essay, I provide evidence that differences in financial structure are the proximate cause for these national asymmetries in the monetary policy transmission mechanism, and that these differences in financial structure are a result of differences in legal structure. My conclusion is that unless legal structures are harmonized across Europe, the financial structures and monetary transmission mechanisms of the European union countries will remain diverse.

AB  - As African countries await the birth of her monetary union, the link between economic policies and the real economy will continue to dominate policy debate. This paper investigates whether financial development influences the effectiveness of monetary policy on output and inflation in Africa. We apply standard panel data techniques to annual data from 1990–2015 for a panel of 39 African countries, and find a weak relationship between financial development and monetary policy effectiveness in Africa. The results show no statistical evidence of the relationship for output growth, whereas a negative relationship exists in the case of inflation, but only at their contemporaneous levels. Thus, there is need to strengthen the monetary transmission mechanism in African countries through deliberate efforts to deepen financial sector development.

TI  - The identification of fiscal and monetary policy in a structural VAR
AU  - Dungey, Mardi
AU  - Fry, Renée
T2  - Economic Modelling
AB  - Good economic management depends on understanding shocks from monetary policy, fiscal policy and other sources affecting the economy and their subsequent interactions. This paper presents a new methodology to disentangle such shocks in a structural VAR framework. The method combines identification via sign restrictions, cointegration and traditional exclusion restrictions within a system which explicitly models stationary and non-stationary variables and accounts for both permanent and temporary shocks. The usefulness of the approach is demonstrated on a small open economy where policy makers are actively considering the interaction between monetary and fiscal policies.

T2  - The Quarterly Review of Economics and Finance
AB  - This paper employs smooth transition autoregressive (STAR) models to investigate the nonlinear effect of monetary policy on stock returns. The change in the Federal funds rate is used as an endogenous measure of monetary policy, and the growth rate of industrial production is also considered in the model. Our results show that the relationship between the monetary policy and excess returns on stock prices is positive and nonlinear. A decrease in the Federal funds rate causes a larger increase in excess returns if excess stock returns are located in the extreme low excess returns regime.

AB  - This paper applies regime-switching methods to the problem of measuring monetary policy. Policy preferences and structural factors are specified parametrically as independent Markov processes. Interaction between the structural and preference parameters in the policy rule serves to identify the two processes. The estimates uncover policy episodes that are initiated by switches to “dove regimes,” shown to Granger-cause both NBER recessions and the Romer dates. These episodes imply real effects of monetary policy that are smaller than those found in previous studies.

TI  - Uncertainty, Learning, and Gradual Monetary Policy
AU  - Sack, Brian P.
AB  - This paper argues that interest-rate smoothing may be optimal when the effect of monetary policy is uncertain. A model is presented in which the Federal Reserve rationally learns about the policy multiplier by observing the reaction of the economy to recent choices of the interest rate. As a result of this learning process, the Fed faces greater uncertainty about the impact of its policy as it moves the interest rate away from its previous level. The optimal policy response to macroeconomic developments therefore involves gradual adjustment of the interest rate over a period of time during which the Fed is learning about the effect of its policy, consistent with the smoothness of interest rate movements found in estimated policy rules. The model also suggests that periods of active interest rate movements, by allowing the Fed to learn more effectively, may be followed by a more aggressive policy rule.

AB  - We exploit data on historical revisions to real-time estimates of the output gap to examine the implications of measurement error for the design of monetary policy, using the Federal Reserve’s model of the U.S. economy, FRB/US. Measurement error brings about a substantial deterioration in economic performance, although the problem can be mitigated somewhat by reducing the coefficient on the output gap in policy rules. We also show that it is usually optimal to place some weight on the level of the output gap in the conduct of policy, but under extreme conditions it may be preferable to focus on output growth.

TI  - Output Composition of the Monetary Policy Transmission Mechanism in Japan
AU  - Fujiwara, Ippei
T2  - Contributions in Macroeconomics
AB  - In this paper, we investigate the output composition of the monetary policy transmission mechanism in Japan. The predominant channel through which monetary policy affects output in Japan is usually thought to be the investment channel, namely the process whereby a change in the interest rate alters the cost of capital and therefore investment. In the United States, however, the consumption channel, which works through intertemporal substitution, is commonly considered the more significant of the two. The aim of this paper is twofold: 1) based on analysis using VAR models to understand which of the two channels, the consumption channel or the investment channel, plays the more important role in the transmission of the Japanese monetary policy; and 2) to contribute to the research on what Angeloni, Kashyap, Mojon and Terlizzese (2003) term the "Output Composition Puzzle," referring to the fact that whereas in the United States the predominant driver of output changes is the consumption channel, in the Euro area it is the investment channel. Results obtained from the Japanese models imply that the investment channel is more important.

AB  - With the aid of the St. Louis equation and the general method of moments (GMM) approach, this study investigates the relative effect of monetary and fiscal policy on economic development in Africa within the period 1995–2016. The study shows that money supply has significant positive relationship with GDP per capita while interest rate has significant negative effects. Government spending has significant negative relationship with GDP per capita while taxation has significant positive effects. Other macroeconomic variables such as primary enrollment and openness to trade have significant positive effects while inflation has negative effects. The environmental variable, carbon emissions, has significant negative effects. Among the institutional variables, corruption has significant negative effects. The results therefore support both Keynesian and monetarist positive policy assertions: Money supply, interest rate, government spending and taxation are viable instruments to stabilize output. However, this study shows that utilizing monetary policy and interest rate as policy tools is more powerful than using government spending and taxation. This is in line with the predictions of Milton Friedman and Schwartz (1963) and other advocates of the St. Louis equation. Therefore, in order to attain higher economic development, African economies should rely more on monetary policy as compared to fiscal policy.

AB  - We study the implications for optimal monetary policy of introducing habit formation in consumption into a general equilibrium model with sticky prices. Habit formation affects the model's endogenous dynamics through its effects on both aggregate demand and households’ supply of output. We show that the objective of monetary policy consistent with welfare maximization includes output stabilization, as well as inflation and output gap stabilization. We find that the variance of output increases under optimal policy, even though it acquires a higher implicit weight in the welfare function. We also find that a simple interest rate rule nearly achieves the welfare-optimal allocation, regardless of the degree of habit formation. In this rule, the optimal responses to inflation and the lagged interest rate are both declining in the size of the habit, although super-inertial policies remain optimal.

AB  - The study examinee the effect of monetary policy on agricultural sector in Nigeria, utilizing time series data for the periods spanning from 1970 to 2010. The study captures both monetary and non-monetary policy variables such as lending rate, commercial banks credit to agriculture, exchange rate, government expenditure in agriculture and inflation rate in examining the effect of monetary policy on agricultural output. The methodology adopted is the Auto- Regressive Distributed Lag (ARDL) Bound Testing Approach. The results obtained shows that exchange rate and government expenditure had positive and significant effect on agricultural output and, hence agricultural sector in Nigeria. It is recommended that a sound exchange rate policy should be implemented aimed at boosting agricultural exports in Nigeria. Also, government investment to provide the basic infrastructure and institutions should be sustained because without the appropriate institutions, monetary policy cannot impact positively on real sector.

AB  - The study examines the impact of switching from direct to indirect monetary policy on industrial growth in Nigeria, using the annual time series data sourced from the Central Bank of Nigeria’s (CBN) statistical bulletin between 1960 and 2015. The study adopts the Autoregressive Distributed Lag (ARDL) bound testing approach developed by Pesaran, Shin and Smith (2001) for estimating the relevant relationships. The result of the long-run estimates shows that domestic credit, interest rate and trade balance have positive impact on industrial output while money supply, inflation and exchange rate have negative impact on industrial growth. The result of the short-run dynamics shows that change in the previous (one and second lagged) periods of indirect monetary policy (interest rate, money supply, domestic credit and exchange rate) and industrial output were negatively related to change in industrial output. The error correction term indicates the speed of adjustment of equilibrium to their longrun position, which was found to be negative and significant. The study recommends that policy makers use both conventional and non-conventional monetary policies to speed up industrial output growth and enhance economic recovery by manipulating the macro-economic fundamentals.

T2  - International Journal of Economics and Finance
AB  - This paper presents a short-term forecasting model of monthly South African macroeconomic variables to estimate the effects of monetary policy on output growth from a Structural Vector Autoregression (𝑆𝑉𝐴𝑅) perspective. A set of forecasting experimentations are carried out to evaluate the out-of-sample static and dynamic forecast for the post-apartheid period. We carried out a combined forecast in order to compare the static with dynamic forecasting approach for improving output growth. The findings reveal that money supply is observed to exert a significant positive impact on output growth from about the eighth month. In addition, the dynamic forecasting is observed to have a more robust result and outperforms the static forecasting. It clearly brings out the growth patterns (increase and decrease) and can be justified and recommended to policymakers in calculating or in predicting the outcome of monetary policy actions for future development. However, in order to improve the predictive forecasting accuracy, the study recommends combined forecasting as dynamic forecasting is associated with risk and uncertainty that is central to its prediction and expected reliability.

We find robust evidence that financial development has a significantly negative impact on the growth effect of monetary policy. We also find that the growth effect of monetary policy tends to be more pronounced as the financial structure of a country becomes more market-based. These results not only add interesting new evidence to the recent literature on the growth effects of monetary policy, but also provide some important insights into the financial determinants of monetary policy effects on economic growth, which have largely been ignored in the previous literature.

AB  - This note merges the fact that real activity is persistent with a Barro-Gordon type model of endogenous monetary policy. It shows that persistence crucially affects policy choices. This applies in non-cooperative games with a finite horizon, and in games with an infinite horizon. Always, enforceable inflation announcements move higher when output persistence increases. Policymakers who discount future utility by 10% annually produce about ten times as much inflation under near-hysteresis as in a natural-rate scenario. A change in the policymaker's time preference may affect inflation both ways, depending on present time preference and persistence.

We first present VAR evidence confirming that this channel exists and is particularly significant on the bank funding side. Then, to rationalize this evidence we build a macroeconomic model where banks subject to runs endogenously choose their funding structure (deposits vs. capital) and risk level. A monetary expansion increases bank leverage and risk. In turn, higher bank risk in steady state increases asset price volatility and reduces equilibrium output.

T2  - South Asian Journal of Macroeconomics and Public Finance
AB  - Every economy comprises of different sectors with divergent characteristics. These different sectors respond heterogeneously to identical unanticipated macroeconomic stimuli. Using a Vector Autoregression model this study finds that the impact of a monetary policy shock at the sectoral level is heterogeneous with manufacturing being the most responsive. The sectors such as Manufacturing, Mining and Quarrying, Construction and Trade are the fastest to respond. The differential sectoral effects depend upon factors such as capital intensity, interest sensitivity, export-orientation, production planning strategies among others. The sectors also differ in terms of the most effective channel of monetary transmission. The interest rate channel has emerged as the most efficient channel of the monetary policy transmission in most of the sectors followed by the credit channel. Therefore, the heterogeneous sectoral responses indicate the need for a more sector-specific monetary policy.JEL Classification: E50, E52, E58, O53

AB  - This paper provides evidence on the role played by monetary policy in the transmission of oil shocks to the US economy. We show that for the period since 1986, oil shocks have had a negative effect on stock returns, regardless of whether the oil shock is defined as the percentage change in the price of oil or a nonlinear transformation of that series. We then demonstrate that there is no relationship between the reaction of individual stock prices to oil shocks and to monetary policy shocks. This implies that oil shocks do have effects on the economy beyond their effect on monetary policy. We conclude that systematic monetary policy is not as effective as suggested in some previous studies.

AB  - There is widespread evidence that monetary policy exerts asymmetric effects on output over contractions and expansions in economic activity, while price responses display no sizeable asymmetry. To rationalize these facts we develop a dynamic general equilibrium model where households’ utility depends on consumption deviations from a reference level below which loss aversion is displayed. State-dependent degrees of real rigidity and elasticity of intertemporal substitution in consumption generate competing effects on output and inflation. Contractions face the Central Bank with higher responsiveness of output to interest rate changes, as well as a flatter aggregate supply schedule.

T2  - European Economic Review
AB  - Empirical evidence indicates that monetary policy is not super-neutral in many countries. In particular, in high inflation economies, inflation is negatively related to economic activity. By comparison, inflation may be positively correlated with output in low inflation countries. We present a neoclassical growth model with money in which the incidence of liquidity risk is inversely related to aggregate capital formation. Interestingly, there may be multiple monetary steady-states where the effects of monetary policy vary. In poor economies, the financial system is highly distorted and higher rates of money growth are associated with less capital formation. In contrast, in advanced economies, a Tobin effect is observed. Since inflation exacerbates distortions from a coordination failure in the low-capital steady-state, individuals become much more exposed to liquidity risk. Consequently, optimal monetary policy depends on the level of development.

TI  - Monetary Policy, the Output Gap and Inflation:
AU  - Djivre, Joseph
AU  - Ribon, Sigal
AB  - This paper presents a quarterly structural model of the Israeli economy
which delineates the transmission mechanism of the monetary policy
during the years 1989-1999 and allows to evaluate the short run
consequences of various exogenous shocks on both the nominal and the
real sectors of the economy.
 The main endogenous variables of the model are the business sector
output gap, the real exchange rate, the inflation rate, the Bank of Israel
(BoI) short-term nominal interest rate and the rate of change of the
business sector nominal wages.
 The estimated model is stable and exhibits to a large extent the
expected properties in response to supply and demand shocks.
The model specification and the estimation results give rise to a
nominal transmission channel and a real activity transmission channel of
the monetary policy to prices. Unlike large and relatively closed
economies in which monetary policy affects prices through its effect on
economic activity, in the case of Israel, the evolution of prices is affected
first, through the nominal exchange rate channel, and only at a later stage
is their effect felt on economic activity.
The estimation results of the BoI nominal interest rate equation suggest a
decreasing weight of short run economic activity in the interest rate
evolution and a rising output and inflation volatility over time following
supply side shocks.

T2  - Scottish Journal of Political Economy
AB  - The COVID-19 recession that started in March 2020 led to an unprecedented decline in economic activity across the globe. To fight this recession, policy makers in central banks engaged in expansionary monetary policy. This paper asks whether the measures adopted by the US Federal Reserve (Fed) have been effective in boosting real activity and calming financial markets. To measure these effects at high frequencies, we propose a novel mixed frequency vector autoregressive (MF-VAR) model. This model allows us to combine weekly and monthly information within a unified framework. Our model combines a set of macroeconomic aggregates such as industrial production, unemployment rates, and inflation with high-frequency information from financial markets such as stock prices, interest rate spreads, and weekly information on the Fed's balance sheet size. The latter set of high-frequency time series is used to dynamically interpolate the monthly time series to obtain weekly macroeconomic measures. We use this setup to simulate counterfactuals in absence of monetary stimulus. The results show that the monetary expansion caused higher output growth and stock market returns, more favorable long-term financing conditions and a depreciation of the US dollar compared with a no-policy benchmark scenario.

It will be shown that monetary policy potentially can affect output, not only in the short run but also with regard to long-run average output. Even though the policy rule is fully known by the rational firm, perfectly anticipated monetary policy intervention may have a permanent real effect in the long run.

AB  - We explore the implications of asset price volatility for the management of monetary policy. We show that it is desirable for central banks to focus on underlying inflationary pressures. Asset prices become relevant only to the extent they may signal potential inflationary or deflationary forces. Rules that directly target asset prices appear to have undesirable side effects. We base our conclusions on (i) simulation of different policy rules in a small scale macro model and (ii) a comparative analysis of recent U.S. and Japanese monetary policy.

Design/methodology/approach Because of the unavailability of the empirical models in the existing study, the authors used past studies review and proposed a new theoretical model. Findings Majority of these studies have documented the negative effects with the exception of a few. The transmission of the monetary policy has been taken place through interest rate risk, asset-liability mismatch, as well as deposit and financing instability. Furthermore, the examined studies have confirmed the viability of the Islamic monetary policy. Originality/value The proposed model may offer some insights to policy makers if it is examined empirically.

AU  - Seth, Rama

AB  - This paper looks at the effect of financial development on output and bank
liquidity by doing a cross-country analysis of 119 countries across 18 years
from 1997-2014. We develop three hypotheses by combining multiple strands
of literature which have heretofore existed in parallel. The main research
question is whether financial development serves to provide greater bank liquidity
and whether it does indeed stimulate output growth. This question is
of particular relevance when there are changes in monetary policy. This paper
goes to the heart of examining whether monetary policy is transmitted more
effectively with better financial development and whether the goal to achieve
output changes via monetary policy is better effected in an environment of
developed financial markets. Our results support the hypotheses that financial
development positively impacts output, and negatively affects bank liquidity.
We also show that with financial development, the effect of bank liquidity on
output is heightened.

AB  - The implications of monetary policy on agricultural performance have not been given adequate attention in literature to date, especially in connection with employment and export in the agricultural sector. Determining the right channels of monetary policy can help to achieve sustainable growth in developing economies. This study examines the impact of monetary policy channels on agricultural performance in Nigeria using structural vector autoregression (SVAR) and dynamic ordinary least squares (DOLS). The study uses output employment and export as metrics for agricultural performance, and the channels of monetary policy considered are credit, interest rate, money and exchange rate. The SVAR variance decomposition findings show that the forecast error shocks of monetary policy channels affect agricultural performance. Likewise, the long-run equations from the DOLS show that output has a positive relationship with money supply, a negative relationship between employment and interest rate, and a negative relationship between exchange rate and export. Based on the findings, the study suggests that the Nigerian government should look beyond the primary objective of stabilizing the economy via money supply and interest rate and consider the secondary benefits of bolstering output and employment in the agricultural sector.

AB  - Inflation targeting is an increasingly popular monetary regime among industrialized and developing central banks. However, there is little cross-country comparative information about commonalties and differences in monetary policy implementation and results across inflation-targeting countries. This paper presents the results of a survey on monetary policy conducted among the world’s twenty central banks that currently target inflation. Survey responses highlight operational features of monetary policy implementation, the ways monetary decisions are made and communicated to the public, and the models on which monetary policy decisions and macroeconomic forecasts are based. The paper also reports the dynamic simulation effects of monetary policy changes on output and inflation reported by individual central banks.

AB  - Employing a time-varying parameter vector autoregression (VAR) model, which is identified by high frequency monetary policy surprises, we examine the effects of monetary policy on the exchange rates. Our results indicate that a contractionary monetary policy shock leads to an appreciation of the exchange rate during both conventional and unconventional monetary policy periods in the US. During the period 2008–2012, when unconventional monetary policy was practiced, monetary policy shocks produced greater negative effects on the exchange rate compared with other periods. We find that the maximal appreciation of the exchange rate occurs within 3–4 months during most of the period, providing favorable evidence to support Dornbusch’s (1976) overshooting hypothesis.

We show that the responsiveness of output toward monetary policy innovations has decreased gradually since the early to mid-2000s, but monetary policy remains effective in boosting output even for the most recent sample. In addition, we find that the volatility of exogenous disturbances has decreased dramatically in the post-2000 period, and that this is the main driver of the recent volatility reductions of both output and inflation.

AB  - Forward-looking behavior on the part of the monetary authority leads least squares estimates to understate the true growth consequences of monetary policy interventions. We present instrumental variables estimates of the impact of interest rates on real output growth for several European countries, using German interest rates as the instrument. We show that the difference between least squares and instrumental variables estimates provides bounds for the degree of endogeneity in monetary policy. The results confirm a considerable downward bias of estimates that do not account for potential forward-looking monetary policy decisions. The bias is higher for countries whose monetary policy was more independent of Germany.

Compared to the benchmark model, we show that the interaction of these two frictions leads to a powerful mitigation of the effects of monetary policy, which is more pronounced at long horizons, and offers a potential rationalization of the "forward guidance puzzle." Each of these frictions, in isolation, would lead to no or much smaller departures from the benchmark model.

The monetary authority extends long-term credit against risky collateral along with its traditional monetary operations. The value of collateral depends on traditional monetary policy and agents can optimally choose to default depending on the relative value of the collateral to the face value of the loan. Default results in foreclosure, higher borrowing costs, inefficient investment and a decrease in total output. We show that pre-crisis contractionary monetary policy interacts with Fisherian debt-deflation dynamics and can increase the probability that a crisis occurs.

To that end, we carry out a structural vector autoregression analysis on macroeconomic variables and private-sector expectations variables, using a time-varying parameters estimation technique with stochastic volatility. We show empirical evidence on two points. First, the BOJ's policy commitment regarding the future course of short-term interest rates, associated with only a small reduction in policy interest rates, succeeded in altering private-sector expectations. Second, the BOJ's policy commitment alone, nevertheless, was not sufficient to restore the previous trends in prices and output.

We use a unique industry level data set that measures the financial characteristics of firms operating at the industry level through time. We bring these financial characteristics formally into the regression analysis, thus allowing for a more precise identification of the two channels. The evidence indicates that both channels are active in the Canadian economy.

AB  - The main characteristics of an Islamic financial system are described relying on recent writings on the subject and on the actual practice of Islamic banking. A theoretical model of an Islamic economic system is developed by generalizing the standard IS-LM model in order to study the effects of monetary policy on the macro-economic variables of an Islamic economy. Whether the authorities attempt to influence monetary conditions through changing the money supply or use the flow of Mudarabah financing as an intermediate objective, there would be no fundamental change in the way monetary policy affects economic variables. An expansionary monetary policy would reduce rates of return and increase output.

TI  - On mergers, monetary policy and output durability
AU  - Adra, Samer
T2  - Applied Economics Letters
AB  - This article examines the causal relation between monetary policy decisions and the variation in the US mergers and acquisitions (M&A) activity in the durable and nondurable goods sectors between 1990 and 2013. The deviation of the monetary policy-set federal funds rate from the natural interest rate estimated by Laubach and Williams (2003) is shown to have significant causal effects on the M&A activity. In the nondurable goods sector, the funds rate’s deviation from the natural rate, rather than the funds rate itself, is the main macroeconomic factor influencing the M&A activity. In the durable goods sector, the variation in the funds rate, only when this rate is significantly below the natural one, is the main macroeconomic factor influencing the M&A activity. Setting the funds rate below the natural rate reflecting long-term fundamentals (a) leads to relatively lower financing costs which, in turn, lead companies to favour M&A relative to internal growth and (b) makes the M&A activity in the durable goods sector, which is sensitive to the variation in the cost of capital, highly dependent on the monetary policy-set rate.

TI  - Expectations and Monetary Policy: Experimental Evidence
AU  - Kryvtsov, Oleksiy
AU  - Petersen, Luba
AB  - The effectiveness of monetary policy depends, to a large extent, on market expectations of its future actions. In a standard New Keynesian business-cycle model with rational expectations, systematic monetary policy reduces the variance of inflation and the output gap by at least two-thirds. These stabilization benefits can be substantially smaller if expectations are non-rational. We design an economic experiment that identifies the contribution of expectations to macroeconomic stabilization achieved by systematic monetary policy. We find that, despite some non-rational component in expectations formed by experiment participants, monetary policy is quite potent in providing stabilization, reducing macroeconomic variance by roughly half.

The result is a book that captures the state of macroeconomic thinking at a transformational moment.The crisis and the weak recovery that has followed raise fundamental questions concerning macroeconomics and economic policy. These top economists discuss future directions for monetary policy, fiscal policy, financial regulation, capital-account management, growth strategies, the international monetary system, and the economic models that should underpin thinking about critical policy choices.

TI  - Income Inequality and Monetary Policy: An analysis on the Long Run Relation
AU  - Davtyan, Karen
AB  - The distributional effect of monetary policy is estimated in the case of the USA. In order to identify a monetary policy shock, the paper employs contemporaneous restrictions with ex-ante identified monetary policy shocks as well as log run identification. In particular, a cointegration relation has been determined among the considered variables and the vector error correction methodology has been applied for the identification of the monetary policy shock. The obtained results indicate that contractionary monetary policy decreases income inequality in the country. These results could have important implications for the design of policies to reduce income inequality  by giving more weight to monetary policy.

TI  - Large Datasets, Small Models and Monetary Policy in Europe
AU  - Favero, Carlo A.
AU  - Marcellino, Massimiliano Giuseppe
AB  - Nowadays a considerable amount of information on the behaviour of the economy is readily available, in the form of large datasets of macroeconomic variables. Central bankers can be expected to base their decisions on this very large information set. Yet the academic profession has shown a clear preference for using small models to highlight stylized facts and to implement policy simulation exercises. Omitted information is then a potentially relevant problem. Recent time-series techniques for the analysis of large datasets have shown how vast an amount of information can be captured by few factors. In this paper we combine factors extracted from large datasets with more traditional small-scale models to analyse monetary policy in Europe. In particular, we model hundreds of macroeconomic variables with a dynamic factor model, and summarize their informational content with a few estimated factors. These factors are then used as instruments in the estimation of forward-looking Taylor rules, and as additional regressors in structural VARs. The latter are then used to evaluate the effects of unexpected and systematic monetary policy.

TI  - Trilemma, Not Dilemma: Financial Globalisation and Monetary Policy Effectiveness
AU  - Georgiadis, Georgios
AU  - Mehl, Arnaud
AB  - We investigate whether the classic Mundell-Flemming "trilemma" has morphed into a "dilemma" due to financial globalisation. According to the dilemma hypothesis, global financial cycles determine domestic financial conditions regardless of an economy's exchange rate regime and monetary policy autonomy is possible only if capital mobility is restricted. We find that global financial cycles indeed reduce domestic monetary policy effectiveness in more financially integrated economies. However, we also find that another salient feature of financial globalisation has the opposite effect and amplifies monetary policy effectiveness. Economies increasingly net long in foreign currency experience larger valuation effects on their external balance sheets in response to exchange rate movements triggered by monetary policy impluses. Overall, we find that the net effect of financial globalisation since the 1990s has been to amplify monetary policy effectiveness in the typical advanced and emerging market economy. Specifically, our results suggest that the output effect of a tightening in monetary policy has been stronger by 40% due to financial globalisation. Insofar as valuation effects can only play out if an economy's exchange rate is flexible, the choice of the exchange rate regime remains critical for monetary policy autonomy under capital mobility and in the presence of global financial cycles. Thus, our results suggest that the classic trilemma remains valid.

AB  - Within an affine model of the term structure of interest rates, where bond yields get driven by observable and unobservable macroeconomic factors, parameter restrictions help identify the effects of monetary policy and other structural disturbances on output, inflation, and interest rates and decompose movements in long-term rates into terms attributable to changing expected future short rates versus risk premia. When estimated, the model highlights a broad range of channels through which monetary policy affects risk premia and the economy, risk premia affect monetary policy and the economy, and the economy affects monetary policy and risk premia.

T2  - Romanian Economic Journal
AB  - The study focussed on the effect of monetary policy on the performance of Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) in three West African countries, Nigeria, Ghana and Gambia over the period of 1981 to 2016. Variables like credit to the private sector, interest rate, inflation rate and exchange rate were employed as explanatory variables, while SMEs output was employed as dependent variable. It was observed that credit to the private sector and inflation rate have negative effect on SMEs output, while exchange rate and interest rate have negative effect on SMEs output over the period. Among all the monetary policy indicators, only interest rate had direct impact on the performance of SMEs in Ghana while exchange rate reported positive impact on SMEs output in Gambia. Consequently, it is concluded that monetary policy in the three countries had not been favourable to the performance of the SMEs sector in West African countries.

TI  - Monetary policy with heterogeneous agents: Insights from TANK models
AU  - Debortoli, Davide
AU  - Galí, Jordi
AB  - How does heterogeneity affect the effectiveness of monetary policy and the properties of economic fluctuations? Using the distinction between constrained and unconstrained households at each point in time, we identify three channels at work in Heterogeneous Agent New Keynesian (HANK) models: (i) changes in the average consumption gap between constrained and unconstrained households, (ii) variations in consumption dispersion within unconstrained households, and (iii) changes in the share of constrained households . We analyze the quantitative importance of each of those factors for output fluctuations in a baseline HANK model. We show that a simple Two-Agent New Keynesian (TANK) model, with a constant share of constrained households and no heterogeneity within either type, approximates reasonably well the implications of a HANK model regarding the effects of aggregate shocks on aggregate output..

TI  - Comparing the Transmission of Monetary Policy Shocks in Latin America: A Hierarchical Panel VAR
AU  - Pérez, Fernando
T2  - Working Papers
AB  - This paper assesses and compares the effects of monetary policy shocks across Latin American countries that put in practice the Inflation Targeting scheme (Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Mexico and Peru). An estimated Hierarchical Panel VAR allows us to use the data efficiently and, at the same time, exploit the heterogeneity across countries. Monetary shocks are identified through an agnostic procedure that imposes zero and sign restrictions. We find a real short run effect of monetary policy on output (with a peak around 12-15 months); a significant medium run response of prices with the absence of the so-called price puzzle and a hump-shaped response of the exchange rate, i.e. weak evidence of the so-called delayed overshooting puzzle phenomenon. Nevertheless, we find some degree of heterogeneity on the impact and propagation of monetary shocks across countries. In particular, we find stronger effects on output and prices in Brazil and Peru relative to Chile, Colombia and Mexico and a stronger reaction of the exchange rate in Brazil, Chile and Colombia relative to Mexico and Peru. Finally, we present a weighted-averaged impulse response after a monetary shock, which is representative for the region. *Note: Winning article in the 2015 Rodrigo Gómez Central Bank Award, organized by the Center for Latin American Monetary Studies (CEMLA).

AB  - We study the design of monetary policy in an estimated model with sticky prices, search and matching frictions, and staggered nominal wage bargaining. We find that the estimated natural rate of unemployment is consistent with the NBER description of the U.S. business cycle, and that the inflation/unemployment trade-off facing monetary policymakers is quantitatively important. We also show that parameter uncertainty has a limited effect on the performance or design of monetary policy, while natural rate uncertainty has more sizeable effects. Nevertheless, policy rules that respond to the output or unemployment gaps are more efficient than rules responding to output or unemployment growth rates, also in the presence of uncertainty about the natural rates.

TI  - Does inflation increase after a monetary policy tightening? Answers based on an estimated DSGE model
AU  - Rabanal, Pau
T2  - Journal of Economic Dynamics and Control
AB  - This paper estimates the importance of the cost channel of monetary policy in a New Keynesian model of the business cycle. A model with nominal and real rigidities is extended by assuming that a fraction of firms need to borrow money to pay their wage bill. Hence, a monetary policy tightening increases effective unit labor costs of production, and might imply an increase in inflation. The paper examines the conditions under which the model can generate a positive response of inflation to a monetary contraction, and estimates the model's parameters using Bayesian methods. The paper shows that the estimated demand-side effects of monetary policy dominate the estimated supply side effect, even if restrictions are imposed that make occurrence of a positive inflation response to a monetary contraction more likely.

AB  - An interesting strand of the theoretical literature on measuring competition posits that when competition increases in an industry, output is reallocated to more efficient firms. Our first contribution is on the methodology for the empirical implementation of this theoretical test of a change in competition. This contribution moves from the relationship between a change in competition and a single all-encompassing efficiency, to a set of relationships between a change in competition and multiple efficiencies that measure different components of economic performance. Our second contribution is to apply our empirical methodology to large U.S. banks. The results suggest that competition intensified between these banks during the financial crisis and beyond (2008−15), vis-à-vis our pre-crisis period (1994−07). This points to an increase in competition that has exogenous origins such as the decrease in the loan-deposit rate spread, which represented the collateral damage to banks from monetary policy to moderate the Great Recession.

TI  - EMPIRICAL INVESTIGATION OF THE IMPACT OF MONETARY POLICY ON MANUFACTURING SECTOR PERFORMANCE IN NIGERIA (1986 – 2012)
AU  - Ehikioya, Lawrence
AB  - Monetary policy is one of the macroeconomic instruments with which monetary authority in a country employed in the management of their economy to attained fundamental objectives of price stability, maintenance of balance of payments equilibrium, and promotion of employment, output growth and sustainable development. These objectives are necessary for the attainment of internal and external balance of value of money and promotion of long run growth of the real economic sectors such as the manufacturing sector. It is against this background, that this study examines the impact of monetary policy on Nigeria’s manufacturing sector performance for the period 19862012. Data were collected from the Statistical Bulletin and Annual Report and Statement of Accounts of the Central Bank of Nigeria as well as the Annual Abstracts of statistics (various issues) published by the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS). Unit root test, Granger Causality test, co integration and VAR model were some of the econometrics techniques used for data estimation. Augmented Dickey Fuller (ADF) test statistic revealed that the time series properties of the variables attained stationarity at level and first order. The variables were co integrated at most 2 with at least 3 co integrating equations. The individual variables: external reserve, exchange rate and inflation rate were statistically significant to manufacturing sector output while broad money supply and interest rate were not statistically significant to manufacturing sector output in the previous and current year. However, interest rate, exchange rate and external reserve impacted negatively on the sector output but broad money supply and inflation rate affect the sector positively. The pair-wise Granger Causality results suggest that real exchange rate and external reserves granger cause Nigeria’s manufacturing output to each other unidirectional. The paper also found that the manufacturing sector contribute insignificantly to the Nigerian economy. Therefore, the study recommended among others that monetary authority should create and implement monetary policies that favoured efficient provider of favourable investment climate by facilitating the emergency of market based interest rate and exchange rate regimes that attract both domestic and foreign investment to the manufacturing industrial sector that are currently operating far below installed capacity. However, in order to maintain and exploit the current investment climate, the Central Bank of Nigeria should introduce more monetary instruments that are flexible enough to meet the supply and demands needs of the manufacturing sector.

T2  - The Review of Economic Studies
AB  - We estimate the effect of shifts in monetary policy using the term structure of interest rates. In our no-arbitrage model, the short rate follows a version of the Taylor's (1993, “Discretion Versus Policy Rules in Practice”, Carnegie-Rochester Conference Series on Public Policy, 39, 195–214) rule where the coefficients on the output gap and inflation vary over time. The monetary policy loading on the output gap has averaged around 0·4 and has not changed very much over time. The overall response of the yield curve to output gap components is relatively small. In contrast, the inflation loading has changed substantially over the last 50 years and ranges from close to zero in 2003 to a high of 2·4 in 1983. Long-term bonds are sensitive to inflation policy shifts with increases in inflation loadings leading to higher short rates and widening yield spreads.
