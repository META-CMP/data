AB  - I develop a methodology that uses the forecasts of market participants and of policy makers to estimate the effects of monetary policy on output and inflation. My approach has advantages over the standard practice of fitting a vector autoregression to the data. I apply my methodology to data on output, interest rates and prices. I find that, even using the Federal Reserve Board's Greenbook forecasts to control for the policy maker's information set, prices rise initially in response to a monetary contraction. This finding undermines the standard justification for including an index of commodity prices in VARs.

TI  - Japan's Monetary Policy in the 1990s and Implications
AU  - Lee, Jaejoon
AB  - It can be seen that the lingering slump and deflation that gripped Japan in the 1990s were basically triggered by the failure to deliver appropriate policies to support its weak demand. Based on optimistic views on economic conditions in the early days of the recession, the Japanese government chose to continue to respond with laid-back policies, and as a result, it failed to prevent long-term slump and deflation from arriving. Its policy authority did miss the early signs of deflation, and underestimate the risks to be caused by misjudgement.

AU  - Aban, Maria Josefina Angelica C.
T2  - International Journal of Trade, Economics and Finance
AB  - This paper empirically tests the presence of a bank lending channel of monetary policy in the Philippines. It aims to demonstrate that bank lending channel is present in the Philippines by showing that loan growth is affected by monetary policy shocks. This study uses quarterly data from 2008-2011 of the country’s 35 commercial and universal banks. The banks are segregated according to the size of their assets: >P300B(large),P200B<size<P300B(large1),P100B<size<P200B( large2),P50B<size<P100B(medium1),P25B<size<P50B(medium 2) and P<25B(small). Panel ordinary least squares method is used to check the relationship between loan growth and monetary policy. Results show that loan growth of small banks is sensitive to movements in monetary policy, thus providing evidence for a bank lending channel in the Philippines. Increase in policy rates result in a decrease in loan supply of small banks. This paper also presents that bank characteristics, particularly size, can have influence in the existence of the bank lending channel.

TI  - Housing and the Changing Impact of Monetary Policy
AU  - Miles, William
AB  - Housing is the leading indicator of the business cycle. The impact of monetary policy on housing has thus unsurprisingly been the subject of numerous studies. Some have also investigated whether the impact of monetary policy has changed since the mid-1980s. These papers to date have relied on vector-autoregressions (VARs). To avoid some of the specification issues of VARs, we employ the local projection method. We find a clear effect of monetary shocks on housing variables over the entire sample.  However, we also find that since 1983, there is no significant impact of policy shocks on either home prices or investment. Moreover, as the difference between the estimated impact of monetary policy on GDP before and after 1983 was not as large as the same difference for housing variables, we infer that changes to housing finance, rather than simply more stable monetary policy, deserve some credit for the lesser impact of Fed shocks.

AB  - There is an ongoing debate on how to identify monetary policy shocks in SVAR models. Graphical modelling exploits statistical properties of data for identification and offers a data based tool to shed light on the issue.  The information set of the monetary authorities, which is essential for the identification of the monetary shock seems to depend on availability of data in terms of higher frequency with respect to the policy instrument.

AB  - This article utilises state-level data for 1961–2012 to examine the interlinkage between informal finance and monetary policy. The analysis suggests that in response to a monetary contraction, borrowing from moneylenders declines, whereas that from landlords and relatives increases. In addition, the evidence also supports a hierarchy among the preferred financing choices. A key takeaway is that monetary policy needs to take on board its impact on the hitherto neglected informal sector.

AU  - Rahman, Mr Shakir
AB  - The central objective of this paper is to find the validity of cost push and monetary factors on GDP deflator through empirical analysis. The empirical analysis has been conducted by using the technique of Ordinary Least Square using annual data for the period from 1971-72 to 2006-07. Before applying OLS the stationary of the data was checked by Augmented Dickey Fuller (ADF) test. Regression analysis proves that both cost push and monetary factors are influenced on wholesale price index. The monetary variables have significant impact on GDP deflator. There is no single remedy to control the raise of wholesale price index. Government should do opt multipurpose strategy such as improvement in tax and revenue structure, improving fiscal and monetary discipline, removing supply side disruptions, eradication of anti-competitive market practice.

AU  - Brown, Stephen

T2  - Economic and Financial Policy Review
AB  - Considerable research finds oil price shocks have had major effects on U.S. output and inflation. Several recent studies argue that the response of monetary policy-rather than the oil price shocks themselves-caused the fluctuations in economic activity. Stephen Brown and Mine Yucel show that an oil price increase will lead to a decline in real GDP and an increase in the price level that are of a similar magnitude if the federal funds rate is unconstrained-a finding consistent with the definition of monetary neutrality in which nominal GDP is constant. Brown and Yucel also find that holding the federal funds rate constant in the face of an oil price increase is an accommodative policy that boosts real GDP, the price level, and nominal GDP. In short, the monetary authority can use accommodative policy to cushion the negative effects of higher oil prices on real GDP, but at the expense of higher inflation.

AU  - Georgios, Karras
T2  - International Economic Journal
AB  - This paper examines whether the effects of monetary police on the exchange rate depend on the openness of the economy. Theoretically, openness can be shown to have an ambiguous effect on the ability of money to influence the exchange rate, so the issue has to be resolved empirically. Using annual data from the 1953-1990 period for a panel of 37 countries, the empirical results indicate that the effects of monetary policy on the exchange rate are negatively affected by the economy’ s openness. Therefore, the more open the economy, the smaller the (short-run) depreciation effects of a given increase in the money growth rate (in the long run, relative PPP applies). This finding is robust to a number to different specifications. [E52, F41]

AB  - Instruments of monetary and fiscal policy are beyond the control of the management but they do influence the short-term as well as long-term decision making of the firm. Empirical studies with respect to their effect on financing decisions of the firm are somewhat under researched particularly in the context of developing countries. The aim of the study was to analyse the effect of these instruments on the financing decisions of the non-financial firms listed on PSX for the period 2008-2015. Fixed effect model was used to analyse the effect of instruments of monetary policy and fiscal policy on the financing decisions of firms. Based on sample of 338 firms, the findings of the study revealed that instruments of monetary policy and fiscal policy do influence the financing decisions of the firm. M2, tax revenue and government debt has a significant effect on the debt ratio of listed firms whereas real interest rate is insignificantly related. Moreover, the relationship between real interest rate, M2 and tax revenue and debt ratio is negative whereas in case of government debt it is positive.

the second proposition is model dependent. It is exactly true in some of the simpler
models we use to think about monetary policy, such as the benchmark newKeynesian model. In that model there is, as Jordi Gali and I have christened it, a
‘divine coincidence’.1 Stabilizing inflation in the face of either taste or technology
shocks indeed yields the right level of output from a welfare viewpoint.

This literature, however, does not provide a clear and consensual explanation for the modalities of this stylized fact. In this paper, two independent empirical models are performed to shed more light on the cross-sectoral impacts of monetary policy. The results of first study indicate that there is no straightforward qualitative relationship between the degree of durability and the interest-sensitivity of durables. While, the second study shows that, in response to monetary policy shocks, productive durables behave differently from consumer durables. For both studies, two models have been estimated using the quarterly data of the U.S. over the period 1954:III – 2007:II JEL Classification: E52, L68.

T3  - Department of Economics Working Paper Series
AB  - This article investigates how market participants adjust their expectations of interest rates at different maturities in response to a monetary policy and a central bank information shock for the US economy. The results show that market participants adjust their expectations faster to changes in interest rates compared to new releases of information by the central bank. This finding could imply that central bank information shocks are more opaque whereas a change in interest rates provides a stronger signal to the markets. Moreover, financial market agents respond with an initial underreaction to both shocks, potentially resembling inattention or overconfidence. Last, we find that the adjustment of expectations for yields with higher maturities takes considerably longer than for short-term yields. This finding is especially important for central banks since in the current low-interest rate environment monetary policy actions mainly consist of policies aimed at the long-end of the yield curve.

TI  - Distributional E↵ects of Monetary Policy on Housing Bubbles: Some Evidence
AU  - Limjaroenrat, Vorada
AB  - Empirical asset pricing has always considered housing only as an investment good. This paper explores empirically the e↵ect of monetary policy on housing bubbles when there exists a duality in housing markets: invest (own) vs. consume (rent). Using both simple and time-varying structural vector autoregression (SVAR and TVC-SVAR) with the U.S. housing market data between 1983-2017, this paper studies monetary transmission separately in the homeowners’ market and the renters’ market. Major ﬁndings are: (i) house price is sticky in that it takes more than 2.5 years for the full impact of monetary policy to occur; (ii) there is heterogeneity in the two housing markets: house price dynamic is more consistent with its fundamental in the renters’ market rather than in the homeowners’ market. This suggests that the two markets di↵er in their vulnerability to housing bubbles. (iii) monetary policy can play a useful role in stabilizing housing bubbles. Results are robust to alternative identiﬁcations of monetary policy shock.

AB  - The financial crisis of 2007-11 has now been analysed and explained from almost every conceivable standpoint. Far less attention has been paid to the long business cycle expansion that started in 1992 and provided an exceptional period of macroeconomic stability in the UK. To many it seemed that the main problem of the UK economy had been solved: that of sustained non-inflationary economic growth. This book brings together senior macroeconomists from universities and the Bank of England to look at what policy-making lessons can be learned from looking at the period of expansion that preceded the financial crisis. It does so with the twin aims of encouraging more policy-focused research on the UK and encouraging policy debate in the aftermath of the financial crisis and the prolonged economic recession. Students, researchers and practitioners with an interest in the UK economy will need to absorb the lessons of this book.

T2  - Journal of Economic Studies
AB  - This paper presents an empirical analysis of the monetary transmission mechanism in four Caribbean countries: Jamaica, Trinidad and Tobago, Barbados and Guyana. This research is timely since little is known about the transmission mechanism of monetary policy in developing countries in general and in the Caribbean in particular. In developing countries financial markets tend to be relatively unsophisticated hence monetary policy is likely to affect the real sector by altering the quantity and availability of credit rather than the price of credit. The results show that the credit and exchange rate channels are more important than the money channel in transmitting impulses from the financial sector to the real sector. The findings can assist policy makers in other developing countries in the design and implementation of monetary policy.

					This article compares the out-of-sample forecasting ability of a new Keynesian DSGE (Dynamic Stochastic General Equilibrium) model, specified and estimated for Brazil, with a Vector Autoregression (VAR). The article innovates in relation to other similar studies made for Brazil (Castro et al. (2011) e Caetano e Moura (2013), by choosing a specification for the DSGE model that, allowing the use of a richer information set, made possible to compute the predictive ability of the DSGE from forecasts that are, truly, out-of-sample forecasts. Moreover, unlike other articles that used Brazilian data, it also verifies to what degree the responses of variables to a monetary and an exchange rate shock. The estimated DSGE model is similar to the ones adopted by Justiniano e Preston (2005) and Alpanda (2009, 2010a, 2010b). The BVAR model was estimated using a Bayesian procedure like those proposed by Sims and Zha (1998) and Rubio-Ramíres, Waggoner and Zha (2005). The results show that the estimated DSGE model is capable of making out-of-sample forecasts, for some variables, that are competitive when compared to a VAR model.

AB  - In the long run, monetary policy has price stability as an objective, while fiscal policy is the instrument of growth policy. But monetary and fiscal policies, by their influence on aggregate demand, affect output and employment in the short run. Near term the economy may slow to trend quickly enough to stabilize unemployment at its current level, but whether we are below NAIRU is uncertain. How in the long run can we successfully juggle the objectives of full employment and modest, stable inflation. The Taylor Rule and "opportunistic disinflation" are discussed as possible approaches.

TI  - The Impact of the Crisis and Unconventional Monetary Policy on European Inflation Dynamics: Evidence from a Three-Period Structural Model and Six Countries
AU  - Schäfer, Benjamin
T2  - Review of Economics
AB  - This study investigates the impact of the economic crisis in the late 2000s and early 2010s on European inflation dynamics using a hybrid New-Keynesian Phillips Curve (NKPC) during three distinct periods. The pre-crisis period from 1999 through mid-2007, the crisis period until August 2012, and finally the “Whatever-It-Takes”-period after the remark by ECB president Mario Draghi. The structural hybrid NKPC is estimated for six countries of the Euro area (Germany, France, Italy, Spain, The Netherlands and Austria) and for each of the three periods. The crisis and the subsequent reaction of the ECB both seem to have had a profound impact on the dynamics, as estimated parameters differ markedly between the periods. A discussion and interpretation of the results is provided.

TI  - The distributive effects of conventional and unconventional monetary policies
AU  - Davtyan, Karen
AB  - The paper evaluates the distributional effects of conventional and unconventional monetary policies for the USA. The distributional effects are evaluated for the overall impact on the income distribution, using Gini index. The paper also assesses the effects of conventional and unconventional monetary policies on the different parts of income distribution, employing corresponding percentile ratios. The obtained results show that contractionary conventional monetary policy reduces income inequality while expansionary unconventional monetary policy raises it. In particular, the results indicate that the distributional impact of conventional monetary policy is stronger. Nevertheless, its impact on the lower part of income distribution is not significant while unconventional monetary policy has a significant effect on it. In addition, the variance decomposition analysis reveals that unconventional monetary policy explains the higher share of the variation in Gini index of income inequality.

AB  - A New Keynesian model estimated for India yields valuable insights. Aggregate demand reacts to interest rate changes with a lag of three quarters, while inflation takes four quarters to respond to demand conditions. Inflation thus responds to monetary policy actions with a lag of seven quarters. Inflation is inertial and persistent when it sets in, irrespective of the source. Exchange rate pass-through to domestic inflation is low. Inflation turns out to be the dominant focus of monetary policy, accompanied by a strong commitment to the stabilization of output.

T2  - European Economic Review
AB  - We use data on UK banks׳ minimum capital requirements to study the interaction of monetary policy and capital requirement regulation. UK banks were subject to both time-varying capital requirements and changes in interest rate policy. Tightening of either capital requirements or monetary policy reduces the supply of lending. Lending by large banks reacts substantially to capital requirement changes, but not to monetary policy changes. Lending by small banks reacts to both. There is little evidence of interaction between these two policy instruments. The differences in the responses of small and large banks identify important distributional consequences within the financial system of these two policy instruments. Finally, our findings do not corroborate theoretical models that raise concerns about complex interactions between monetary policy and macro-prudential variation in capital requirements.

AB  - This paper estimates the effects of monetary policy on the UK economy based on a new, extensive real-time forecast data set. Employing the Romer–Romer identification approach we first construct a new measure of monetary policy innovations for the UK economy. We find that a 1 percentage point increase in the policy rate reduces output by up to 0.6% and inflation by up to 1.0 percentage point after two to three years. Our approach resolves the price puzzle for the United Kingdom and we show that forecasts are crucial for this result. Finally, we show that the response of policy after the initial innovation is crucial for interpreting estimates of the effect of monetary policy. We can then reconcile differences across empirical specifications, with the wider vector autoregression literature and between our United Kingdom results and the larger narrative estimates for the United States.

AB  - We document that the transmission of monetary policy to real house prices and housing investment is heterogeneous across the US states during the period 1983-2008 and relate this heterogeneity to various state level observable factors. We find that an expansionary monetary policy raises real house prices and residential investment at the national level, the increase being much larger for some states but smaller for others. For states with higher percentage of older people, population density, income inequality the responses are above those of the national aggregates; for states with higher poverty rates and more educated people the responses are below those of the national aggregates. Higher property tax rates are also associated with lower responses of housing investment and house prices.

We estimate a time-varying Bayesian VAR model that allows for quantifying the impact of monetary policy shocks on asset prices and bubbles. The energy sector is measured through the S&P Energy Index, while bubbles are measured through the difference between asset prices and the corresponding dividends for the energy sector. We find significant differences in the impact of monetary policy shocks for the aggregate economy and for the energy sector. The findings seem sensitive to the interest rate use, i.e., whether one uses the shadow interest rate or the long-term interest rate.

TI  - MAINTENANCE OF THE MONETARY SYSTEM STABILITY IN UZBEKISTAN | European Journal of Business and Economics
AB  - During the years of independence, the Republic of Uzbekistan has succeeded in building the modern monetary system. The national currency was introduced, monetary and currency markets have been developed along with the provision of independence of the Central Bank. However, the stability of national monetary system has not been ensured yet. In particular, the monetization level of the economy remains low, while the GDP deflator is rather high. In addition, high level of national currency devaluation is observed in recent years.Eventually all these urgent problems will negatively influence the stability of macroeconomic growth. The relatively high level of the GDP deflator (GDP deflator reflects a more realistic rate of inflation) has led to the significant growth of the money supply, which resulted in a strong devaluation of the national currency of Uzbekistan. For example, in 2012 the devaluation level of the national currency against the U.S. dollar was 10.5%. In addition, because of the low monetization coefficient, a crisis of defaulted payments among business entities has arisen.The author proposes to increase the volume of foreign currency swap and Gold Swap operation of the Central Bank of Uzbekistan in order to decrease the devaluation of the national currency. The author also suggests increasing the flexibility of monetary policy instruments such as an open market policy and reserve requirements to ensure the stable growth of the money supply.

AU  - Alcidi, Cinzia
AU  - Busse, Mathias
AU  - Gros, Daniel
AB  - Central banks in the developed world are being misled into fighting the perceived dangers of a ‘deflationary spiral’ because they are looking at only one indicator: consumer prices.

This Policy Brief finds that while consumer prices are flat, broader price indices do not show any sign of impending deflation: the GDP deflator is increasing in the US, Japan and the euro area by about 1.2-1.5%. Nor is the real economy sending any deflationary signals either: unemployment is at record lows in the US and Japan, and is declining in the euro area while GDP growth is at, or above potential. Thus, the overall macroeconomic situation does not give any indication of an imminent deflationary spiral.

In today’s high-debt environment, the authors argue that central banks should be looking at the GDP deflator and the growth of nominal GDP, instead of CPI inflation. Nominal GDP growth, as forecasted by the major official institutions, remains robust and is in excess of nominal interest rates.

They conclude that if the ECB were to set the interest rate according to the standard rules of thumb for monetary policy, which take into account both the real economy and price developments of broader price indicators, it would start normalising its policy now, instead of pondering over additional measures to fight deflation, which does not exist. In short, economic conditions are slowly normalising; so should monetary policy.

AB  - This work provides evidence on the potential effects of monetary policy on the income class structure via stimulating economic activity and employment in the Eurozone countries over the period 2007Q3-2016Q1. Based on European Union Statistics on Income and Living Conditions (EU-SILC) data, we compute the size of income classes (lower, lower-middle, upper-middle, and upper) for the stats that originated the Economic and Monetary Union (EMU-11) and analyse the impact of monetary policy impulses under a Bayesian Vector Autoregressive approach. We focus on the earnings heterogeneity and the income composition channel and find that a monetary easing shock involving a decrease short-term nominal interest rate has diverse effects on the different income classes, which seems to have led to a more equal income distribution. As theoretically argued by these monetary policy transmission mechanisms, our results confirm the GDP growth and the decrease in unemployment caused by the monetary policies implemented by the European Central Bank since the onset of the financial crisis have had a positive effect for those households located at the bottom of the income-class structure as well as for the middle class.

AB  - We examine the relative dominance of credit and monetary policy shocks in influencing asset prices in emerging markets. Estimates from panel VAR models for 22 EMEs provide evidence of a significant impact of bank credit on house prices in contrast to trivial impact on stock prices, possibly due to prudential regulations on banks’ exposure to stock markets. Contractionary monetary policy triggers sizeable and persistent decline in stock than housing prices as higher interest rates may render the funding of leverage costlier. Global shocks play an important role in explaining fluctuations in domestic stock prices rather than house prices since the latter class of asset is largely non-tradable across countries.

AB  - How do varying degrees of information frictions affect the transmission mechanism of monetary policy? Using non‑linear methods, I empirically find that during heightened disagreement, monetary policy has a smaller effect on inflation, yet more influence over output. As a proxy for information frictions, I use real GDP nowcast disagreement across professional forecasters. Significant nowcast disagreement indicates when it is difficult to observe the current economic state, or a period of high information rigidities. I develop a tractable theoretical model that shows rationally inattentive price‑setters produce this result. Improved central bank communication that reduces disagreement among economic agents can mitigate output losses when implementing disinflationary monetary policies.

T2  - Australian Economic Review
AB  - Monetary policy has steadily become tighter over the past twelve months. In various statements, the Government has indicated its view that monetary policy needs to be tight in order to subdue an ‘excessively high’ rate of growth of domestic demand. This article asks whether the current stance of monetary policy is now too restrictive and, if so, what the consequences might be for the pattern and growth of economic activity during 1989-90. A number of scenarios based on alternative settings of monetary policy in 1989-90 are derived from a short-term simulation model of the Australian economy. The scenarios suggest that, if monetary policy remains at the current degree of tightness, the Australian economy may well experience a recession in 1989-90. Some easing of monetary conditions is mandatory if a sharp and unnecessary slowdown of economic activity is to be avoided. Exactly how far monetary policy should be eased depends crucially on the rate of growth of autonomous investment.

AB  - What are the effects of monetary policy on the housing market? Is the response of the housing market similar across different states? We explore the impact of monetary policy shocks on real house prices and housing investment, using US state-level data. To this end we estimate VAR models for the period 1988-2009, to assess the differential effect - if any - of a common monetary policy shock on house prices and investment. Our VAR models also allow us to explore the macroeconomic effect of wealth shocks that originate in the housing market (housing prices). Our empirical models include key macroeconomic variables, namely personal income, prices and the federal funds rate, as well as housing market variables, e.g. real house prices, given by the FHFA house price index, and housing investment, proxied by the number of housing starts. Our baseline estimates suggest that transmission of monetary policy is heterogeneous across US states. Moreover, our VAR models indicate the presence of a wealth effect across most US states, as a positive housing price innovation leads to a strong, negative response of personal income.

AU  - Wieland, Volker
AB  - This note argues that the European Central Bank should adjust its strategy in order to consider broader measures of inflation in its policy deliberations and communications. In particular, it points out that a broad measure of domestic goods and services price inflation such as the GDP deflator has increased along with the euro area recovery and the expansion of monetary policy since 2013, while HICP inflation has become more variable and, on average, has declined. Similarly, the cost of owner-occupied housing, which is excluded from the HICP, has risen during this period. Furthermore, it shows that optimal monetary policy at the effective lower bound on nominal interest rates aims to return inflation more slowly to the inflation target from below than in normal times because of uncertainty about the effects and potential side effects of quantitative easing.

AB  - There has always been an interest in analyzing the effects of fiscal policy on the main macroeconomic variables such as GDP, inflation, interest rate, employment, but compared with the empirical literature on the effects of monetary policy on economic activity, fiscal policy has received less attention. With the recent economic recession fiscal policy was regarded with more interest since it was expected to be effective in economic recovery. An approach commonly used to estimate the effects of fiscal policy shocks on economic activity is based on vector autoregressive (VAR) models with different scheme of identification of the shocks. This paper analyzes the effects of a government expenditure shock and tax revenue shock on economic activity by applying a VAR methodology to Romanian data. For identification of fiscal policy shocks I first used a recursive approach (Cholesky decomposition) and second I apply the methodology proposed by Perotti (2002), based on Blanchard and Perotti (1999). The results obtained are consistent with other studies on emergent economies. The impact of fiscal shocks on macroeconomic variable is reduced and the fiscal multipliers are very small.

TI  - A WIN-WIN MONETARY POLICY IN CANADA
AU  - Ltd, ICB-InterConsult Bulgaria
T2  - Journal of Applied Economic Sciences (JAES)
AB  - The Lucas critique has exposed the problem of the trade-off between changes in monetary policy and structural breaks in economic time series. The search for and characterization of such breaks has been a major econometric task ever since. We have developed an integral technique similar to CUSUM using an empirical model quantitatively linking the rate of inflation and unemployment to the change in the level of labour force in Canada. Inherently, our model belongs to the class of Phillips curve models, and the link between the involved variables is a linear one with all coefficients of individual and generalized models obtained by empirical calibration. To achieve the best LSQ fit between measured and predicted time series cumulative curves are used as a simplified version of the 1-D boundary elements (integral) method. The distance between the cumulative curves (in L2 metrics) is very sensitive to structural breaks since it accumulates true differences and suppresses uncorrelated noise and systematic errors. Our previous model of inflation and unemployment in Canada is enhanced by the introduction of structural breaks and is validated by new data in the past and future. The most exiting finding is that the introduction of inflation targeting as a new monetary policy in 1991 resulted in a structural break manifested in a lowered rate of price inflation accompanied by a substantial fall in the rate of unemployment. Therefore, the new monetary policy in Canada is a win-win one.

TI  - Impacts of monetary policy shocks on the Ethiopian economy
AU  - Benti, Temesgen
AB  - This thesis analyses the impacts of monetary policy shocks on Ethiopian macro economy, and the channels through which these shocks will be transmitted to the overall economy using annual data running from 1981/82-2011/12.In order to achieve this objective; unit roots (ADF and PP), cointegration (Johansen procedure), Vector Autoregressive (VAR), Error correction model and Granger Causality (Wald Coefficient restriction test, X2 and F-statistics) are carried out. The results of the unit root tests show that the series of interest are stationary in first differences. Cointegretion and causality between the variables are tested and compared using tri-variate vector Autoregressive model (VAR). The results of co-integration tests on the tri-variate models show that two Granger-causality alternative models (VAR in first difference and Error Correction Models) fit for this study. In both types of models, Granger-causality (unidirectional or bidirectional causations) between monetary policy instrument on one side and price and economic growth on the other side are tested using Chi – square and F – statistics from Wald coefficient restriction test. The results of cointegration test shows that there is a long run equilibrium relation between the variables. The error correction model and the Wald Granger causality indicates the existence of short run bidirectional causality between money supply and price level, and unidirectional causation running from output to price level that shows that price level is a monetary phenomenon in the short run. Based on the short run causation results, all the foregoing discussion leads to put exchange rate as an important channel of monetary policy instrument to be considered as a supplementary, through which shocks in monetary policy transmits to the real economy.

AB  - We examine the potential policy role of monetary aggregates by attempting to use them as effectively as possible in the analysis of empirical relationships. We focus on their role as information variables, since any more ambitious use, such as in a policy rule, would presuppose some information content in the aggregates. Our results show that in the United States since 1979, the monetary aggregates fall considerably short of those requirements, and results with German M3 are hardly more favorable. We also investigate whether empirical relationships are not reflective of information relationships because of the use of these variables in countercyclical policy. The results are not consistent with that interpretation.

TI  - The impact of monetary and non-monetary factors on GDP dynamics of the Visegrád Group countries
AU  - Goliuk, Viktoriia
T2  - World Scientific News
AB  - ABSTRACT The aim of the article is to identify the factors affecting economic growth of the Visegroup countries. Linear regression have been exploited to analyze the impact of both monetary and non-monetary factors on gross domestic product dynamics of Poland, Check Republic, Slovakia and Hungary. The study have revealed that both monetary and non-monetary factors have impact on GDP dynamics of the Visegrad Group countries, but household final consumption, exports of goods and services, inflation, high-technology exports and broad money growth show the highest correlation with GDP of the countries. All regression models consider GDP dynamics as dependent variable. Collinearity of certain predictor variables have not allowed using the most significant factors to develop linear regression models. As a result, independent variables sets are not those of the highest statistical significance. Therefore, regression model of Poland includes inflation, high-technology exports and real interest rate as predictor variables. Regression model of Check Republic shows the correlation between GDP dynamics as dependent variable and high technology exports, domestic credit provided by financial sector and broad money growth as independent ones. The following independent variables are used to develop the regression line of Slovakia: domestic credit provided by financial sector and broad money growth. Linear regression model of Hungary includes inflation and foreign direct investment as predictors. The study have confirmed the strong positive effect making by foreign direct investment on economic growth of the post-communist countries. The research results also contribute to the thesis about low inflation as one of the key factors of economic growth in the Central European countries. The study also have proved the significant effect on economic growth made by domestic credit provided by financial sector and significant correlation between GDP dynamics and export of goods and services.

AU  - Moneta, Alessio
AB  - The causal inﬂuence of the monetary policy on interest rate, inﬂation, and output (or unemployment) is traditionally studied by assuming that the monetary authority follows a ‘Taylor rule’, which formalizes the dependence of interest rate setting on the macroeconomic situation with respect to the equilibrium of the system. In this paper, we aim at comparing the empirical reliability of this rule with an alternative interpretation of the actual manners in which central banks set monetary policy variables. In particular we consider the ‘solvency rule’, which puts into direct relationship the interest rate set by the central bank with the average solvency conditions of ﬁrms. To make this comparison, we ﬁrst spell out the different causal relationships that they imply. We focus on the role played by nonperforming loans on inﬂuencing both the interest rate setting and macroeconomic conditions. The empirical investigation is conducted following a structural vector autoregressive approach, based on a speciﬁc data-driven identiﬁcation procedure. In this manner, we are able to identify the causal structure among the contemporaneous variables without imposing economic-theoretical restrictions on the model. The results contradict some crucial features of the Taylor rule and provide sufﬁcient support to the alternative causal explanation of monetary policy suggested by the solvency rule.

AB  - This study provides new insights on the allocative effect of monetary policy. It shows that contractionary monetary policy exerts an important reallocation effect by cleansing unproductive firms and enhancing aggregate productivity. At the same time, however, reallocation involves a reduction in the number of product variety that is central to consumer preferences and hurts welfare. A contractionary policy prevents the entry of new firms and insulates incumbent firms from competition, reducing aggregate productivity. We provide empirical evidence on U.S. data that corroborates the relevance of monetary policy for product variety resulting from firm entry and exit.

TI  - Monetary Policy Over Fifty Years: Experiences and Lessons
AU  - Herrmann, Heinz
AB  - This book is based on a conference celebrating the 50th anniversary of the Deutsche Bundesbank. Since the 1950s, there have been fundamental changes in the monetary order and financial systems, in our understanding of the effects of monetary policy, the best goals for central banks and the appropriate institutional setting of central banks. Prominent monetary economists and central bankers give their views on the most significant developments during this period and the lessons we should draw from them.  The book contains four sections on central issues. The first part discusses the main successes and failures of monetary policy since the 1950s. The second part asks what economists have learned about monetary policy over the past 50 years. It gives an overview on experiences with various monetary strategies, focusing in particular on monetary targeting and its problems, on inflation targeting and why it was successful and the institutional framework for monetary policy. The next section outlines the progress that monetary economists have made since the Bundesbank was founded and discusses the extent to which central banks can rely on "scientific" principles. The final part describes the interaction between monetary policy, fiscal policy and labour markets.   The book provides a comprehensive overview of the main challenges faced by central bankers in the past and how and to what extent monetary economics have been helpful in tackling them. It outlines our current knowledge about the effects of monetary policy and the appropriate institutional framework for central banks and raises some open questions for the future. It will be of great interest to monetary economists, central bankers and economic historians.

TI  - The Impact of Monetary Surprise and Systematic Monetary Policy in Developing Countries: Empirical Results from an International Perspective
AU  - Odedokun, M.O.
T2  - Social and Economic Studies
AB  - The study examines whether (in developing economies), in accordance with the macro rational expectations hypothesis, it is only the unanticipated monetary growth, and not anticipated monetary growth, that has a significant positive impact on the real GDP. We conduct a cross-country annual-data-based study that embraces 16 developing countries over periods that fall within 1957-1989. We employ the anticipated and unanticipated monetary growth as regressors in explaining variations in the cyclical part of real GDP and find that the unanticipated monetary growth does not necessarily explain variations in the real GDP better than the anticipated monetary growth, particularly in the low-income developing countries. Our findings show that while the hypothesis is somewhat supported in the high-income LDCs, it is generally contradicted in the low-income LDCs. A conclusion emanating from the findings is that the extent of the level of economic development of a country positively affects the degree of relevance of the hypothesis there. El estudio examina si (en las economías en desarrollo) de acuerdo a la hipótesis de expectativas racionales a nivel macro, sólo el crecimiento monetario anticipado (y no el crecimiento monetario anticipado), tiene un impacto significativo en el Producto Bruto Interno (PBI) real. Realizamos un estudio cruzado con datos anuales de los países involucrados que abarca 16 países en desarrollo, durante el período 1957-1989. Utilizamos el crecimiento monetario anticipado y no anticipado como regresores al explicar las variaciones en la parte cíclica del PBI y observamos que el crecimiento monetario no anticipado no explica necesariamente mejor las variaciones en el PBI real que el crecimiento monetario anticipado, paraticularmente en países en desarrollo de bajos ingresos. Nuestras observaciones muestran que mientras la hipótesis es hasta cierto punto válida para algunos países en desarrollo con altos ingresos, en general se contradice en los países en desarrollo de bajos ingresos. La conclusión que emana de esta observaciones es que el alcance del nivel de desarrollo económico de un país afecta positivamente el grado de relevancia de la hipótesis en el mismo. L'étude examine si (dans les économies en voie de développement), suivant le macro hypothèse d'expectations rationelles, c'est seulement la croissance monétaire non prévue, et non pas la croissance monétaire prévue, qui a un impact positif important sur le PIB réel. Nous conduisons une étude à base de données annuelles à travers des pays qui inclut 16 pays en voie de développement pendant des périodes entre 1957-1989. Nous employons la croissance prévue et non prévue comme régresseurs pour expliquer les variations dans la partie cyclique du PIB réel et nous trouvons que la croissance monétaire non prévue n'explique pas forcément les variations dans le PIB réel mieux que la croissance monétaire prévue, surtout dans les pays en voie de développement aux faibles revenus. Nos résultats démontrent que pendant que l'hypothèse est un peu supporté dans les LDCs (pays moins développés) a revenue élevés, c'est en général contredit dans les LDCs économiquement faibles. Une conclusion provenant des résultats c'est que le niveau de développement économique d'un pays a un effet positif sur le degré de pertinence de l'hypothèse là.

TI  - South Africa: The Cyclical Behavior of the Markups and its Implications for Monetary Policy
AU  - Klein, Nir
AB  - The study looks at the cyclical behavior of the markups and assesses its impact on inflation dynamics. The analysis finds that the aggregate level of the private sector's markup is relatively high, thus pointing to the lack of strong competition in South Africa's product markets. Additionally, the results suggest that the markups tend to move in a countercyclical manner, with a short-term positive impact on inflation. This implies that the countercyclical pattern of the markups is one factor among others that contribute to the relatively weak output gap-inflation co-movement. In the context of South Africa's inflation targeting framework, the counter-cyclical markups may also generate an asymmetric response of monetary policy to the fluctuations in economic activity.

AB  - This study examines the effects of the monetary policy of the United States on commodity prices. Using a Bayesian Structural VAR, we identify the interest rate shocks as a measure of the stance of the U.S. monetary policy and evaluate their impacts on different types of commodity prices. The empirical evidence suggests that a U.S. monetary contraction has a negative and significant effect on the aggregate commodity prices, which takes place with a substantial lag (i.e., eight quarters after the shock). However, the aggregate response masks the existence of significant heterogeneity in the responses of the different types of commodities. More specifically, a positive interest rate (contractionary) shock leads to: i) an initial increase in the prices of non-fuel commodities, which later reverts path and becomes negative (as in the case of the prices of agricultural raw materials); ii) a positive and persistent rise in the food prices; iii) a fall in the beverage prices; and iv) a persistent reduction in the prices of metals and the prices of fuel (energy) prices.

AB  - This paper assesses the effect of monetary policy on major components of aggregate demand. We use three different macromodels, all estimated on Hungarian data of the past 10 years. All three models indicated that after an unexpected monetary policy tightening investments decrease quickly. The response of consumption is more ambiguous, but it is most likely to increase for several years, which may be explained by the slow adjustment of nominal wages. On the other hand, we could not detect any significant change in net exports during the first couple of years after the shock. The weak response of net exports can be due to the fact that the drop in exports is coupled with a fall in imports of almost the same magnitude, highlighting the relative importance of the income-absorption effect, as opposed to the expenditure-switching effect.

T2  - Journal of Economic Dynamics and Control
AB  - This paper investigates the empirical relevance of a new framework for monetary policy analysis in which the decision makers are allowed, but not required, to weight differently positive and negative deviations of inflation and output from the target values. The estimates of the central bank's Euler equation indicate that the preferences of the Fed had been asymmetric only before 1979, with the interest rate response to output contractions being larger than the response to output expansions of the same magnitude. We show that this asymmetry on output implied an average inflation bias around 1.5%. While the implicit inflation target also declined, the asymmetric preferences induced inflation bias appears to account for a sizable fraction of the historical decline in the inflation mean.

TI  - The housing market channel of monetary policy transmission in the Euro area
AU  - Milcheva, Stanimira
AU  - Sebastian, Steffen
T2  - Journal of European Real Estate Research
AB  - Purpose The purpose of this paper is to explore the role of the housing market in the monetary policy transmission to consumption among euro area member states. It has been argued that the housing market in one country is then important when its mortgage market is well developed. The countries in the euro area follow unitary monetary policy; however, their housing and mortgage markets show some heterogeneity, which may lead to different policy effects on aggregate consumption through the housing market. Design/methodology/approach The housing market can act as a channel of monetary policy shocks to household consumption through changes in house prices and residential investment – the housing market channel. The authors estimate vector autoregressive models for each country and conduct a counterfactual analysis to disentangle the housing market channel and assess its importance across the euro area member states. Findings The authors find little evidence for heterogeneity of the monetary policy transmission through house prices across the euro area countries. Housing market variations in the euro area seem to be better captured by changes in residential investment rather than by changes in house prices. As a result, the authors do not find significantly large house price channels. For some of the countries however, they observe a monetary policy channel through residential investment. The existence of a housing channel may depend on institutional features of both the labour market or with institutional factors capturing the degree of household debt as is the loan-to-value ratio. Originality/value The study contributes to the existing literature by assessing whether a unitary monetary policy has a different impact on consumption across the euro area countries through their housing and mortgage markets. The authors disentangle monetary-policy-induced effects on consumption associated with variations on the housing markets due to either house price variations or residential investment changes. The authors show that the housing market can play a role in the monetary transmission mechanism even in countries with less developed mortgage markets through variations in residential investment.

TI  - Output Decomposition and the Monetary Policy Transmission Mechanism in Bangladesh: A Vector Autoregressive Approach
AU  - Suranjit, K.
AB  - This paper investigates the output composition of the monetary policy transmission mechanism for Bangladesh. Vector Auto-regression (VAR) models are used to analyse the data from 1973 to 2015. Although the central bank’s policy interest rate shock does not significantly affect the major compositions of the output, investment channel still works better than consumption. However, exchange rate shock effects more significantly on the real economy mainly through consumption than investment. This research, on one hand, demonstrates the potential channels of the monetary policy transmission mechanism. On the other hand, methodologically, it proposes a minor modified model that suite for economy of the developing countries like Bangladesh where the net export component of output is negative which creates some complexity in using the standard model used for developed countries like the USA, the EU, Japan and Australia.

TI  - Output Composition of Monetary Policy Transmission in Mongolia
AU  - Chuluunbayar, Delgerjargal
AB  - The transmission of monetary policy has been found to differ between countries in the empirical literature. Understanding the degree to which each gross domestic product (GDP) component - investment, consumption and net export - is affected by policy changes is essential to conducting monetary policy. This paper examines the output composition of monetary policy transmission in Mongolia based on data from 2005Q1 to 2019Q2 and three kinds of benchmark VAR models. It is also comparing the results with other countries, finding Mongolian monetary policy transmission is dominated by the investment channel and its response is quicker than comparator countries.

TI  - Interest-Rates-Free Monetary Policy Rule
AU  - Raffinot, Thomas
AB  - Interest rates are unreliable indicators of appropriate monetary policy; low nominal rates do not indicate easy money. This paper attempts to assess the stance of monetary policy without relying on interest rates. A new monetary policy rule is developed based on a forward-looking generalization of the Taylor rule. Two complementary approaches are investigated. First, this new monetary indicator is used to evaluate the stance of monetary policy in real time, based on expectations from the Survey of Professional Forecasters in the euro area and in the United States. Second, an ex post analysis based on the latest available data gauges the monetary policy stance in retrospect. The real-time analysis evaluates how the monetary policy stance was judged, and the ex post analysis offers a more objective evaluation of the monetary policy stance. This study highlights that conventional wisdom on monetary policy is often incorrect, even when rates are high. Furthermore, tight monetary policy explains the historical collapse in nominal gross domestic product during the Great Recession, the slow recovery, and the resulting low nominal interest rates.

TI  - National Accounts Revisions and Output Gap Estimates in a Model of Monetary Policy with Data Uncertainty
AU  - Mahadeva, Lavan
AU  - Muscatelli, Alex
AB  - This paper looks at some implications of data uncertainty for monetary policy. We combine national accounts data revisions with optimal control and filtering experiments on a calibrated model to discuss policy implications of price-versus-volume data uncertainty in GDP data for the United Kingdom. We find some degree of negative correlation between revisions to real GDP and GDP deflator data. We develop a methodology for estimating the output gap which takes account of the benefit of hindsight and decreasing measurement errors through time. Our optimal control experiments reveal that monetary policy makers would be led to place greater weight on nominal GDP data and correspondingly less weight on separate, uncertain estimates of prices and volume growth. However, estimates of real growth and also the output gap matter even when there is much uncertainty of this type. Our results also suggest that estimates of the level of inflationary pressure and nominal GDP data become more important when the economy is prone to inflationary overreactions to shifts in technological progress

T2  - Journal of Money, Credit and Banking
AB  - We use a Bayesian time-varying parameters structural VAR with stochastic volatility for GDP deflator inflation, real GDP growth, a 3-month nominal rate, and the rate of growth of M4 to investigate the underlying causes of the Great Moderation in the United Kingdom. Our evidence points toward a dominant role played by good luck in fostering the more stable macroeconomic environment of the last two decades. Results from counterfactual simulations, in particular, show that (i) “bringing the Monetary Policy Committee back in time” would only have had a limited impact on the Great Inflation episode, at the cost of lower output growth; (ii) imposing the 1970s monetary rule over the entire sample period would have made almost no difference in terms of inflation and output growth outcomes; and (iii) the Great Inflation was due, to a dominant extent, to large demand non-policy shocks, and to a lesser extent—especially in 1973 and 1979—to supply shocks.

We use a forward-looking Taylor rule model to examine if monetary policy since the 19 October 1987 stock market crash has been influenced by the valuation of the stock market. We estimate the model using revised and real-time data and find no empirical evidence that the Federal Reserve policy attempted to moderate stock market valuations during the late 1990s despite the “irrational exuberance” comments by Chairman Greenspan. Actually, the empirical evidence suggests that the Fed accommodated the high valuations of the stock market during this period.

TI  - The effects of oil price shocks on U.S. inflation
AU  - Kilfoil, Natasha M.
AB  - During the 1970’s the United States experienced several periods of high inflation that have been at least partially attributed to positive oil price shocks. The effectiveness of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries at controlling the price of oil has varied over time, as well as the responsiveness of U.S. inflation to an oil price shock. Current economic theory, supported by empirical data, suggest that oil price shocks can lead to short run changes in inflation. Since the GDP deflator can be considered the average price of final goods produced in an economy, the effects from an input price change can be quite different on the GDP deflator from the Consumers Price Index which measures the average price of consumption. As the price of oil rises, nominal value added falls while domestic real value added remains constant, creating a short run deflation in value added measures such as the GDP deflator. The CPI experiences rising inflation because the consumer’s goods basket has now become more expensive from the rising price of oil. In the long run, inflation is not affected by an oil price shock because it is controlled by monetary policy.

AB  - This paper makes an attempt to develop a model on effects of monetary and fiscal stimulus in Pakistan economy. The well-trodden technique Vector autoregressive (VAR) has been applied on the annual time series data for the period from 1972-2007, including both fiscal and monetary sides using data on output gap, inflation, short term interest rate, and government fiscal deficit over the period. This paper makes the contribution in the literature by considering the impact of both monetary and fiscal policies together. We have found positive effect of fiscal stimulus on inflation; but that on output gap the effect is negative. Effect of interest rate on output gap and inflation has been found to be negative. For policy reaction, we have found countercyclical response of monetary policy; but that of fiscal policy is pro-cyclical. The response of interest rate to deficit financing is negative while fiscal deficit positively responds to changes in interest rate.

Even after controlling for institutional quality, we find no evidence that the central bank makes use of the Taylor framework in devising monetary policy. Our results also suggest that by and large the focus of the monetary policy has been on containing inflation.

AB  - This paper studies the relative performance of alternative monetary policy rules in the presence of oil price shocks in a small open economy optimizing model. Our analysis shows that it is important to distinguish between alternative price indices (CPI, core CPI, and GDP deflator) when modeling the effects of oil price increases. This distinction has important implications for monetary policy as the central bank has to decide which inflation rate to target. Our results demonstrate that targeting the change in the GDP deflator is an inferior monetary policy strategy in the presence of oil price shocks.

AB  - We find that during the sample period 1999–2011 monetary policy easing in the Euro area has favoured loan provision relative to other banks’ activities in Germany, Italy and France, but not in Spain with a largest extent of unobserved heterogeneity in France and Italy. The impact on the balance sheets of banks also operates through size in Germany, Italy and France; liquidity in Germany; and capital in Spain. During the financial crisis, the direct impact of monetary easing on loan provisions relative to other assets has decreased in Germany and France, while its indirect impact has increased for smaller banks in France and less liquid banks in Germany. These results suggest that monetary policy easing has supported relatively more French small banks and German banks with liquidity constraints.

AU  - Lee, Dong Jin
AU  - Yoon, Jai Hyung
T2  - Economic Modelling
AB  - This paper empirically explores the New Keynesian Phillips Curve (NKPC) in multiple quantiles and examines the uncertainty structure of the inflation process focusing on its relation to the asymmetry of monetary policy. We propose a multi-quantile version of the Generalized Method of Moments using the Laplace-type estimator. The empirical findings support the canonical NKPC with larger coefficients for marginal cost and expected inflation in the upper quantiles of the inflation distribution, while the hybrid NKPC fits better with the mid and lower quantiles. Accordingly, the risk of high inflation, measured by the right side tail of the conditional density, is more responsive to a change in expected inflation compared with the center and the left side. These results imply that monetary policy affects the future path of inflation in an asymmetric way, such that a tightening of monetary policy reduces high-inflation risks more than what we expect based on the point path, whereas the effect of expansionary policy on downside risk is minor. We also perform structural break tests and find that the model is unstable through 1983. There is a moderate change in the post-break data such that the downside risk of inflation becomes less responsive to expected inflation, which may reduce the cost of contractionary monetary policy.
