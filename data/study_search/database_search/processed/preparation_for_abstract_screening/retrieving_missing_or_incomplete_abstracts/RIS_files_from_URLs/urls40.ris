AB  - The empirical analysis of monetary policy requires the construction of instruments for future expected inflation. Dynamic factor models have been applied rather successfully to inflation forecasting. In fact, two competing methods have recently been developed to estimate large-scale dynamic factor models based, respectively, on static and dynamic principal components. This paper combines the econometric literature on dynamic principal components and the empirical analysis of monetary policy. We assess the two competing methods for extracting factors on the basis of their success in instrumenting future expected inflation in the empirical analysis of monetary policy. We use two large data sets of macroeconomic variables for the USA and for the Euro area. Our results show that estimated factors do provide a useful parsimonious summary of the information used in designing monetary policy. Copyright © 2005 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

TI  - Spillover effects from Euro area monetary policy across Europe: A factor-augmented VAR approach
AU  - Potjagailo, Galina
T2  - Journal of International Money and Finance
AB  - I analyze spillover effects from a Euro area monetary policy shock to fourteen European countries outside the Euro area. The analysis is based on a factor-augmented VAR model with two blocks, which exploits a large cross-country data set. After a Euro area monetary policy expansion, production increases in most non-Euro area countries, whereas short-term interest rates and financial uncertainty decline. These effects are on average comparable to the responses in the aggregate Euro area. However, the size of spillover effects varies with country characteristics. Spillovers on production are larger in non-Euro area economies with higher trade openness, whereas financial variables react to a higher extent in countries with higher financial integration. Regarding the exchange rate regime, countries with fixed exchange rates show stronger spillovers both in terms of production and interest rates. Finally, prices increase in Western European economies outside the Euro area, but decline or do not respond in Central and Eastern Europe.

AB  - Laubach and Williams (2003) employ a Kalman filter approach to jointly estimate the neutral real federal funds rate and trend output growth using an IS relationship and an output-gap-based inflation equation. They find a positive link between these two variables, but also much error surrounding neutral real rate estimates. We modify their approach by including variables for regulations on deposit interest rates and on wages and prices. These variables are statistically significant and notably affect estimates of two policy-relevant coefficients: the sensitivity of output to the real interest rate and that of inflation to the output gap.

T2  - International Journal of Central Banking
AB  - This paper examines the roles of bank capital regulation and monetary policy in mitigating procyclicality and
promoting macroeconomic and financial stability. The analysis is based on a dynamic stochastic model with imperfect
credit markets. Macroeconomic stability is defined in terms
of a weighted average of inflation and output-gap volatility, whereas financial stability is defined in terms of three
alternative indicators (real house prices, the credit-to-GDP
ratio, and the loan spread), both individually and in combination. Numerical experiments associated with a housing
demand shock show that in a number of cases, even if monetary policy can react strongly to inflation deviations from
target, combining a credit-augmented interest rate rule and a
Basel III-type countercyclical capital regulatory rule may be
optimal for promoting overall economic stability. The greater
the degree of policy interest rate smoothing, and the stronger the policymaker’s concern with financial stability, the larger is
the sensitivity of the regulatory rule to credit growth gaps.

AB  - This paper deals with the implications of factor demand linkages for monetary policy design in a two-sector dynamic general equilibrium model. Part of the output of each sector serves as a production input in both sectors, in accordance with a realistic input–output structure. Strategic complementarities induced by factor demand linkages significantly alter the transmission of shocks and amplify the loss of social welfare under optimal monetary policy, compared to what is observed in standard two-sector models. The distinction between value added and gross output that naturally arises in this context is of key importance to explore the welfare properties of the model economy. A flexible inflation targeting regime is close to optimal only if the central bank balances inflation and value added variability. Otherwise, targeting gross output variability entails a substantial increase in the loss of welfare.

TI  - The macroeconomic effects of monetary policy shocks under fiscal constrained: An analysis using a DSGE model

AU  - Maia, Sinézio Fernandes
T2  - Journal of Economic Studies
AB  - Purpose This paper aims to analyze the macroeconomic effects of a monetary policy shock considering that fiscal policy is under fiscal constraints. For that, a dynamic stochastic general equilibrium (DSGE) model was developed for Brazil, which was estimated through Bayesian econometrics. Design/methodology/approach In the basic model, the government does not have any type of fiscal restriction. The other two estimated models, however, consider that the fiscal authority implements some kind of fiscal rule. One of these rules is the Constitutional Amendment 95/2016 (EA 95/2016), which includes a limitation for government spending. The other Alternative Rule seeks to represent the characteristics of a more austere fiscal rule, as proposed by Wesselbaum (2017). Findings It was possible to verify in this paper that the implementation of EA 95/2016 by the Brazilian government does not produce statistically different results and that it reduces the welfare of the households in relation to the scenario without fiscal rule. Thus, the proportionate benefit of EA 95/2016 is less than the cost associated with this fiscal rule (less welfare). If the government adopts a fiscal constraint similar to the Alternative Rule, it is possible to considerably reduce the interaction between fiscal and monetary policy, thereby reducing the fiscal dominance policy over monetary policy. However, the cost in terms of welfare is much higher than the baseline scenario. Thus, the fiscal authority is subject to a trade-off among public debt stabilization and household welfare. Originality/value The study intends to contribute to the literature on three specific points. First, the monetary–fiscal policy interaction within a representative model of the Brazilian economy is discussed. In addition, the study considers that the government can adopt EA 95/2016 and the Alternative Rule, used in the US economy. Second, the impacts of EA 95/2016 and the Alternative Rule on household welfare will be quantified. Finally, two types of individuals (Ricardian and non-Ricardian agents) and two sectors of production (wholesalers and retailers) are considered. In this paper, the DSGE model is estimated, since the previously mentioned authors performed simulations

TI  - Trends in Monetary Policy Transparency*
AU  - Geraats, Petra M.
T2  - International Finance
AB  - Transparency has become a prominent feature of monetary policy as central banks have greatly increased the amount of information they disclose about monetary policy-making. This paper is the first to systematically analyse transparency trends throughout the world and across monetary policy frameworks. It shows that the most notable change in central bank communications has been the greater prevalence of the publication of macroeconomic forecasts and explanations of monetary policy decisions. The rise in transparency has not been confined to inflation targeters but extends to other monetary policy frameworks, although there are significant differences in information disclosure. Nevertheless, in some respects central banks remain quite opaque, in particular about policy deliberations and policy inclinations. This paper also establishes some stylized facts about the macroeconomic environment. In particular, countries with higher inflation and economic development have undergone larger increases in transparency. Moreover, countries with greater transparency have experienced lower subsequent inflation.

TI  - Estimating the Macroeconomic Effects of Monetary Unions: The Case of Trade and Output
AU  - Anyanwu, John C.
T2  - African Development Review
AB  - Abstract: This paper examines the various theories and paradigms relating to trade and output in monetary unions. Both descriptive and empirical evidence have been used to analyse the case of African regional economic groupings, especially that of the West African Economic and Monetary Union (WAEMU) and other countries in the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS). While the descriptive statistics point to greater room for improvement, especially in the areas of price stability, fiscal discipline and greater intra-trade, the empirical evidence shows that monetary union is beneficial to bilateral trade and especially economic growth. The results support the hypothesis that important beneficial effects of monetary union also come through central bank credibility. Résumé: Le présent article examine divers paradigmes et théories concernant les transactions entre les unions monétaires et le rendement de ces groupes. Ses auteurs utilisent des éléments descriptifs et empiriques probants pour analyser le cas de groupes économiques régionaux africains, notamment celui de l’Union économique et monétaire ouest-africaine (UEMOA) et d’autres groupes de pays tels que la Communautééconomique des ètats de l’Afrique de l’Ouest (CEDEAO). Alors que les données descriptives indiquent que les unions monétaires ont encore beaucoup à faire pour stabiliser davantage les prix, renforcer la discipline financière et améliorer les transactions intragroupes. En revanche, les éléments de preuve empiriques montrent que les unions monétaires offrent certains avantages pour les échanges bilatéraux et, plus particulièrement, pour la croissance économique. Leurs conclusions viennent étayer l’hypothèse selon laquelle les banques centrales peuvent, lorsqu’elles sont crédibles, peuvent produire des effets tout aussi importants et bénéfiques que les unions monétaires.

AB  - The study analyses the impact of monetary policy shocks on domestic output growth in Nigeria from 1981 to 2019, using ARDL and VECM Granger causality. Employing three monetary policy variables of interest rate, broad money supply and exchange rate, the empirical results establish that shocks in money supply have positive impact on domestic output growth in the long-run, while shocks in interest rate and exchange rate have negative impact on domestic output growth in the long-run. Furthermore, the results affirm a unidirectional causality from money supply to real gross domestic product, and from real gross domestic product and interest rate to exchange rate in Nigeria. The study recommends that the use of the interest rate channel in pursuing the goal of output growth should be applied with caution, while the money supply tools should be made more vibrant, towards achieving increased domestic output growth.

TI  - Optimal Monetary Policy in a Financially Fragile Economy
AU  - Demirel, Ufuk D.
T2  - The B.E. Journal of Macroeconomics
AB  - This paper studies optimal monetary policy in an economy where firms rely heavily on external funds to finance operational costs. In the model, financial contracts are subject to agency problems and firms can possibly default on borrowed funds. Financial frictions have two separate effects on the model. First, they introduce an indirect cost channel to the monetary transmission mechanism. Second, they exacerbate the welfare costs of output gap fluctuations. The indirect cost channel implies that a given reduction in inflation can be achieved with a smaller output loss. This effect encourages the policy maker to emphasize inflation stabilization. At the same time, agency costs also make output gap fluctuations more costly in terms of economic welfare. This second effect encourages the policy maker to place more emphasis on output gap stabilization. Whether the optimal policy requires greater inflation stabilization or output gap stabilization depends on the balance of these two effects. Under a reasonable parametrization, the first effect dominates the second and the optimizing policy maker adopts a stricter anti-inflationary stance.

TI  - Relative effectiveness of monetary and fiscal policies on output growth in Turkey: an ARDL bounds test approach
AU  - Ltd, ICB-InterConsult Bulgaria
T2  - Equilibrium. Quarterly Journal of Economics and Economic Policy
AB  - Effects of monetary and fiscal policy on output growth has been one of the major topics that economists have been investigating. Monetary and fiscal policies are tools for economists and policymakers to correctly direct the economy and facilitate the growth and development of the country. Accordingly, it is critically important for policy-makers in the area of economy to study the efficiency and the effectiveness of such policies. But, so far, there has been no generally accepted evidence suggesting the effectiveness of either the policy in Turkey or around the world. Instead, the dominance of either policy is subject to a change period to period and country to country. Purpose of the article: The purpose of this study is to analyze the growth effectiveness of fiscal and monetary policies and then determine which of these two policies is more powerful in promoting economic growth in Turkey over the period 1998 and 2016. Methods: To investigate the growth effectiveness of monetary and fiscal policies, we use some of the time series econometric techniques, such as ARDL Bounds testing, structural break unit root tests and Granger causality tests. Findings &amp; Value added: Monetary policy variable is creating only short-run effects on growth; but, it’s not causing any Granger causality on it. On the other hand, fiscal policy variable has a long-run significant effect and causing to growth. Thus, the fiscal policy seems to be more effective than monetary policy during examination period, implying the rethinking the implementation of both policies in Turkey. To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first attempt to investigate the relative effectiveness of economic policies on growth in Turkey in terms of both methods used and period chosen.

In addition, Calvo type staggering allows one to be able to consider arbitrarily slow adjustment of prices without having to work with a large state space.The third chapter investigates the ability of nominal price rigidity to explain the co-movement of inflation with the cyclical component of output observed in post-war U.S. data using Calvo type staggering. It is demonstrated that models with nominal price rigidity can explain the observed associations between movements in inflation and output much better than flexible price models. This conclusion depends little upon whether money supply is assumed to be endogenous or not.The fourth chapter analyzes the consequences of introducing nominal price rigidity and money into an otherwise standard real business cycle model for cyclical properties of optimal fiscal and monetary policy at business cycles frequencies. It is shown, among other things, that imperfect competition put more restriction on the set of preferences that leads the Friedman rule to be optimal, and the differences between the Ramsey allocations with and without nominal rigidity do not disappear even when degree of nominal price rigidity is made arbitrarily small.

TI  - Monetary policy, credit markets, and banks: A DSGE perspective
AU  - Rubio, Margarita
T2  - Economics Letters
AB  - The monetary policy transmission mechanism changed after the 2008 crisis. Evidence shows that credit markets and the banking system play now a predominant role in the pass-through of monetary policy to the real economy. This paper examines the monetary transmission mechanism in a Dynamic Stochastic General Equilibrium (DSGE) model that; on the one hand, includes a financial accelerator that operates through collateral constraints in credit markets, and, on the other hand, also presents regulatory constraints on the banking sector. Results show that the financial accelerator effects make monetary policy more effective, in line with the rest of the literature. However, the introduction of banks reduces part of this effectiveness due to regulatory requirements on bank capital, as observed during the crisis time. Furthermore, an optimal monetary policy analysis concludes that when adding all these ingredients into the model, monetary policy should respond more strongly to output and less to inflation than in a standard model new Keynesian model, due to the inclusion of extra distortions that create welfare trade-offs among agents.

AB  - What are the economic effects of an interest rate cut when an economy is in the midst of a financial crisis? Under what conditions will a cut stimulate output and employment, and raise welfare? Under what conditions will a cut have the opposite e ffects? We answer these questions in a general class of open economy models, where a financial crisis is modeled as a time when collateral constraints are suddenly binding. We find that when there are frictions in adjusting the level of output in the traded good sector and in adjusting the rate at which that output can be used in other parts of the economy, then a cut in the interest rate is most likely to result in a welfare-reducing fall in output and employment. When these frictions are absent, a cut in the interest rate improves asset positions and promotes a welfare-increasing economic expansion.

TI  - Optimal Monetary Policy with Durable and Non-Durable Goods
AU  - Erceg, Christopher J.
AU  - Levin, Andrew T.
AB  - The durable goods sector is much more interest sensitive than the non-durables sector, and these sectoral differences have important implications for monetary policy.  In this paper, we perform VAR analysis of quarterly US data and find that a monetary policy innovation has a peak impact on durable expenditures that is roughly five times as large as its impact on non-durable expenditures.  We then proceed to formulate and calibrate a two-sector dynamic general equilibrium model that roughly matches the impluse response functions of the data. While the social welfare function involves sector-specific output gaps and inflation rates, we find that performance of the optimal policy rule can be closely approximated by a very simple rule that targets a weighted average of aggregate wage and price inflation rates.  In contrast, some commonly-prescribed policy rules (such as strict price inflation targeting and Taylor's rule) perform very poorly in terms of social welfare.

AB  - This timely volume presents the latest thinking on the monetary policy rules and seeks to determine just what types of rules and policy guidelines function best. A unique cooperative research effort that allowed contributors to evaluate different policy rules using their own specific approaches, this collection presents their striking findings on the potential response of interest rates to an array of variables, including alterations in the rates of inflation, unemployment, and exchange.  Monetary Policy Rules illustrates that simple policy rules are more robust and more efficient than complex rules with multiple variables. A state-of-the-art appraisal of the fundamental issues facing the Federal Reserve Board and other central banks, Monetary Policy Rules is essential reading for economic analysts and policymakers alike.

TI  - Temporary Price Changes and the Real Effects of Monetary Policy
AU  - Kehoe, Patrick J.
AU  - Midrigan, Virgiliu
AB  - In the data, prices change both temporarily and permanently. Standard Calvo models focus on permanent price changes and take one of two shortcuts when confronted with the data: drop temporary changes from the data or leave them in and treat them as permanent. We provide a menu cost model that includes motives for both types of price changes. Since this model accounts for the main regularities of price changes, its predictions for the real effects of monetary policy shocks are useful benchmarks against which to judge existing shortcuts. We find that neither shortcut comes close to these benchmarks. For monetary policy analysis, researchers should use a menu cost model like ours or at least a third, theory-based shortcut: set the Calvo model's parameters so that it generates the same real effects from monetary shocks as does the benchmark menu cost model. Following either suggestion will improve monetary policy analysis.

TI  - The effect of monetary policy shocks on stock prices accounting for endogeneity and omitted variable biases
AU  - Farka, Mira
T2  - Review of Financial Economics
AB  - A new high frequency data set is used to estimate the impact of the Fed on the level and volatility of stock prices while accounting for endogeneity and omitted variable biases and potential asymmetries. Results show that after addressing these issues, the effect of policy shocks on the level and volatility of stock returns is higher than previously reported. GARCH findings indicate that the volatility impact is tent-shaped, spiking during policy announcements and declining before and after the release. The level and conditional volatility of stock returns is found to respond asymmetrically to the type of policy shocks (timing versus future path of monetary policy) and the type of policy action (easing versus tightening).

AB  - Applying a spatial competition model to banking, we analyze the effects of the choice of a monetary policy rule by the central bank on banks’ market power as measured by the Lerner index. We show that a procyclical monetary policy may reinforce the countercyclical movement of the Lerner index. That is, this measure of competitiveness of the banking sector may vary more over the business cycle due to the monetary policy rule.

This paper studies the industrial effects of monetary policy in China using the Vector Autoregression (VAR) model. We explore the heterogeneity of the response three pillar industries and factor intensity industries to a monetary shock. In order to capture the transmission of monetary policy, decomposing monetary policy as anticipated and unanticipated is considered. Results show evidence of the industrial effects of aggregate monetary policy shock is almost not effective. And the effectiveness of monetary policy shocks is conducted in close association with expectations and factor intensity.

Economic policy affects employment primarily through monetary and fiscal policies, which with their instruments affect aggregate supply and demand for goods and services. The aim of this article is to determine the impact of monetary policy on unemployment in Croatia. For this purpose, the bounds testing (ARDL) approach for cointegration is applied. The results indicate the existence of stable cointegration relationship between the variables and show that Croatian monetary policy is quite limited in reducing unemployment.

TI  - The Effect of Monetary Policy on Monthly and Quarterly Stock Market Returns
AU  - Durham, J. Benson
AB  - Several studies report an empirical link between changes in monetary policy and short- as well as long-run stock market performance in the United States.  Such findings are germane both to the study of market anomalies and to monetary policy transmission mechanisms.  Previous univariate time-series results on long-run data, which use the discount rate as the main policy  indicator, seem robust to alternative specifications of stock price returns given data on 16 countries from 1956 through 2000.  However, out-of-sample tests indicate that the relation has largely decreased over time. Also, panel regressions, which notably include cross-sectional variance and therefore are particularly relevant to market participants, suggest that the  relation is less sturdy, and consideration of excess as opposed to raw equity  price returns in time-series regressions indicates no relation.  Finally,  alternative measures of central bank policy suggest a weaker and a diminished correlation between monetary policy changes and long-run stock market performance.

AB  - This paper investigates the effects of limited asset market participation on the effectiveness of monetary policy in a New Keynesian Dynamic Stochastic General Equilibrium model. Although an increase in consumers who cannot access financial markets reduces the effects of interest rate policies through consumption inter-temporal allocation (neoclassical or permanent income effect), we find an opposite result: monetary policy becomes more effective as the degree of financial market participation falls. The reason has a very Keynesian flavor.

We find that monetary policy shocks have a persistent effect on house prices, real estate wealth, and private sector debt and a strong short-lived effect on risk spreads in money and mortgage markets. Moreover, the results suggest that monetary policy contributed considerably to the unsustainable precrisis developments in housing and credit markets. Although monetary policy shocks contributed discernibly at a late stage of the boom, feedback effects of other (macroeconomic and financial) shocks via lower policy rates kicked in earlier and appear to have been considerable.

The results reported are based on a carefully designed common simulation experiment involving a 100 basis point rise in the policy interest rate for two years accompanied by common assumptions regarding the path of long-term interest rates and the exchange rate. Aggregating the country level results, the fall in output is found to reach a maximum of 0.4% after 2 years. The maximum aggregate fall in prices is also 0.4%, but it occurs 2 years later. The dominant channel of transmission in the first two years is the exchange rate  channel, but in terms of the impact on output, the user cost of  capital channel becomes dominant from the third year of the simulation onwards.

T2  - Pacific Economic Review
AB  - Over the past decade, technological innovations have changed the dynamics of the financial system. As a result, firms have used cellular phones, the Internet, and digital currencies to facilitate exchanges and operate their businesses. This course of action affects the transmission mechanism of monetary policy. The goal of the present study is to examine the role that fintech plays in the transmission mechanism of monetary policy. First, we analyse the income velocity and the money multiplier during pre-fintech and post-fintech periods. The results confirm that there is no change in income velocity and the money multiplier during these periods. Second, we develop the money demand function to examine the effect of monetary policy and demonstrate that low monetary policy rates lead to an increase in money demand. When we introduce fintech components to examine their impact on money demand, we find that mobile and Internet technologies and all digital currencies considered in this study are robust predictors of money demand. Third, we analyse the product market equation and report that after the initiation of fintech, monetary policy has a significant effect. To examine the cost function, we incorporate fintech components and identify that cellular phones, Internet technology, Litecoin, and Ethereum are the determinants of the output gap. Finally, we examine the drivers of fintech and determine that the real interest rate, GDP, inflation, the financial development index, and stock market indices are significant determinants of fintech.

T2  - International Economics and Economic Policy
AB  - We study the effects of unconventional monetary policy shocks on output, inflation and uncertainty using a sign restricted panel VAR over the monthly period of 2008:1–2015:1. Our sample includes primarily OECD countries (Canada, Germany, France, Italy, Japan, Spain, UK and US) that reached the interest rate zero lower bound in response to the recent financial crisis. Central bank balance sheets are used to gauge the size of unconventional monetary policy reactions to the crisis. We control for the degree of uncertainty by estimating the economic response to balance sheet shocks in two economic states: high versus low uncertainty. We use sign restrictions to identify our shocks, but remain agnostic regarding price and output responses to balance sheet shocks. We show that the mean group response of prices and output increases in response to monetary policy. The results, however, vary by country and are sensitive to the degree of uncertainty. Prices and output do not necessarily increase uniformly across countries.

AB  - We study whether a central bank should deviate from its objective of price stability to promote financial stability. We tackle this question within a textbook New Keynesian model augmented with capital accumulation and microfounded endogenous financial crises. We compare several interest rate rules, under which the central bank responds more or less forcefully to inflation and aggregate output. Our main findings are threefold. First, monetary policy affects the probability of a crisis both in the short run (through aggregate demand) and in the medium run (through savings and capital accumulation). Second, a central bank can both reduce the probability of a crisis and increase welfare by departing from strict inflation targeting and responding systematically to fluctuations in output. Third, financial crises may occur after a long period of unexpectedly loose monetary policy as the central bank abruptly reverses course.

T2  - International Review of Economics & Finance
AB  - This paper extends Bernanke and Blinder's [Am. Econ. Rev. 78 (1988) 435] “credit-channel” model to the open economy. In particular, it examines whether the monetary policy results predicted by the popular textbook Mundell–Fleming model [e.g., Can. J. Econ. Polit. Sci. 29 (1963) 475; IMF Staff Pap. 9 (1962) 369] change with the open-economy version of the Bernanke and Blinder credit-channel model. This examination is important to consider in light of the popularity of the Mundell–Fleming model at the policymaking level and in light of recent empirical findings giving strong support to the credit channel as a monetary policy transmission mechanism. The main conclusion is that monetary policy is much more potent under the open-economy version of the Bernanke and Blinder model than under the standard Mundell–Fleming model.

AU  - Gürkaynak, Refet S.

AB  - We investigate the effects of U.S. monetary policy on asset prices using a high-frequency event-study analysis. We test whether these effects are adequately captured by a single factor - changes in the federal funds rate target - and find that they are not. Instead, we find that two factors are required. These factors have a structural interpretation as a current federal funds rate target factor and a future path of policy factor, with the latter closely associated with FOMC statements. We measure the effects of these two factors on bond yields and stock prices using a new intraday dataset going back to 1990. According to our estimates, both monetary policy actions and statements have important but differing effects on asset prices, with statements having a much greater impact on longer-term Treasury yields.

TI  - Optimal monetary policy rules with labor market frictions
AU  - Faia, Ester
T2  - Journal of Economic Dynamics and Control
AB  - This paper studies optimal monetary policy rules in a framework with sticky prices, matching frictions and real wage rigidities. Optimal policy is given by a constrained Ramsey plan in which the monetary authority maximizes the agents’ welfare subject to the competitive economy relations and the assumed monetary policy rule. I find that the optimal rule should respond to unemployment alongside with inflation. This is so since models with matching frictions (unlike standard new Keynesian models) feature a congestion externality that makes unemployment inefficiently high. A strong response to inflation remains optimal while a response to output is always welfare detrimental.

TI  - Monetary policy and exchange rate overshooting: Dornbusch was right after all
AU  - Bjørnland, Hilde C.
T2  - Journal of International Economics
AB  - Dornbusch's exchange rate overshooting hypothesis is a central building block in international macroeconomics. Yet, empirical studies of monetary policy have typically found exchange rate effects that are inconsistent with overshooting. This puzzling result has been viewed by some researchers as a “stylized fact” to be reckoned with in policy modelling. However, many of these studies, in particular those using vector autoregressive (VARs) approaches, have disregarded the strong contemporaneous interaction between monetary policy and exchange rate movements by placing zero restrictions on them. In contrast, we achieve identification by imposing a long-run neutrality restriction on the real exchange rate, thereby allowing for contemporaneous interaction between the interest rate and the exchange rate. In a study of four open economies, we find that the puzzles disappear. In particular, a contractionary monetary policy shock has a strong effect on the exchange rate, which appreciates on impact. The maximum effect occurs within 1–2 quarters, and the exchange rate thereafter gradually depreciates to baseline, consistent with the Dornbusch overshooting hypothesis and with few exceptions consistent with uncovered interest parity (UIP).

TI  - Can Monetary Policy Make a Difference for Economic Growth and Inequality?
AU  - Fortin, Pierre
T2  - Canadian Public Policy / Analyse de Politiques
AB  - L'argument favorable à une politique monétaire visant la stabilité des prix est fondé sur la perception que les avantages d'un taux d'inflation très bas sont "importants et permanents", tandis que ses coûts en chômage accru sont "faibles et transitoires". Je remets en question ces idées reçues. Je rappelle, premièrement, que la preuve quantitative qu'un taux d'inflation extrêmement bas confère des avantages macroéconomiques directs importants est loin d'être faite. Deuxièmement, je démontre que la relation d'arbitrage traditionnelle entre inflation et chômage, qui ne laisse aucune possibilité d'effet permanent de la politique monétaire sur la production et l'emploi, est carrément incompatible avec les données canadiennes de la dernière décennie. Troisièmement, je rapporte de nouveaux résultats démontrant que maintenir l'inflation sous la barre des 2 pour cent (comme la Banque du Canada a fait depuis 1991) entraîne une augmentation importante et permanente du chômage, mais que permettre à l'inflation de dépasser 4 pour cent est également générateur d'une hausse permanente du chômage. Il s'ensuit que le taux d'inflation optimal qui permettrait de réduire le chômage au plus bas niveau possible ne serait ni inférieur à 2 pour cent ni supérieur à 4 pour cent, mais se trouverait quelque part entre ces deux bornes. La Banque du Canada devrait maintenant faire preuve d'opportunisme du côté de l'expansion monétaire et porter le taux d'inflation dans cet intervalle. Comme pauvreté et chômage sont étroitement liés, cette stratégie nouvelle pourrait avoir des conséquences favorables sur le taux de pauvreté au Canada. /// The basis for central bank policy aimed at price stability is the view that the benefits from very low inflation are "large and permanent," and that the related unemployment costs are "small and temporary." I question this belief in three ways: first, I point out that the quantitative evidence of large direct macroeconomic benefits from very low inflation is flimsy. Second, I show that the traditional inflation-unemployment trade-off, which leaves no room for a permanent effect of monetary policy on output and employment, is a total failure as a description of the Canadian experience of the past decade. Third, I report on new evidence which shows that holding inflation below 2 percent (as the Bank of Canada has done since 1991) increases unemployment substantially and permanently, but that pushing inflation above 4 percent also generates higher permanent unemployment. Consequently, the optimal, unemployment-minimizing rate of inflation would be neither less than 2 percent nor greater than 4 percent, but would lie somewhere in between. I conclude that what is called for at this time is a monetary policy that is opportunistic on the expansionary side and brings the inflation rate into this range. Since poverty and unemployment are highly correlated, this new approach could also reduce poverty in Canada.

T2  - The Journal of Economic Asymmetries
AB  - Recent research has moved from the question of whether the effects of monetary policy are asymmetric to the question of why. This paper sheds some light on the nature of these asymmetries by focusing on two distinct types: sign asymmetry (monetary expansions have different effects than monetary contractions) and size asymmetry (large monetary shocks have different real effects than smaller monetary shocks). Using quarterly data from the 1964–2004 period, money-supply shocks and their effects on output, consumption, and investment are estimated for a panel of 12 OECD countries. The paper's findings support both types of asymmetries.

Contractionary monetary policy systematically increases inequality in labor earnings, total income, consumption and total expenditures. Furthermore, monetary policy shocks account for a non-trivial component of the historical cyclical variation in income and consumption inequality. Using detailed micro-level data on income and consumption, we document some of the different channels via which monetary policy shocks affect inequality, as well as how these channels depend on the nature of the change in monetary policy.

TI  - Dynamics of Monetary Policy and Output Nexus in Nigeria
AU  - Bolaji, A
AB  - This paper critically examines the dynamic interaction between monetary policy tools in stimulating economic growth, as well as stabilizing the economy from external shocks in Nigeria. The paper considered key monetary time series variables and real growth of output in formulating Vector Autoregressive (VAR) models which showed interdependence interaction between the period of 1970 and 2007. The time series properties of the selected variables are examined using the Augmented Dickey-Fuller unit root test and the results revealed that only growth of real output and broad money supply are stationary at levels, while saving, lending and exchange rates were found stationary at first difference. The long-run dynamic interaction was established through the Johansen’s Trace and Maximum Eigenvalue tests. The pair-wise Granger-Causality test conducted showed that the growth rate of real output is not a leading indicator for any monetary variables. Other innovation accounting tests were also carried out like impulse responses function to test for the response of growth in real output to innovation shock on monetary variables. Also, the forecast error variance decomposition (FEVD) is used to decompose the monetary shock on the growth rate of real output in Nigeria. Proper policy recommendations were proffered based on the results emanated from the econometric analyses.

It contrasts this approach with financial programming and its emphasis on monetary aggregates, as well as with more econometrically driven analyses. It presents illustrative results from an application to Canada. A companion paper provides a more detailed how-to guide and introduces a set of tools designed to facilitate this approach.

AB  - In this paper we present a first approach to the study of the transformation in the transmission mechanism of monetary policy that has taken place in Mexico in recent years. For this purpose, we use a non-linear VAR model that allows for regime shifts. The comparison of the different regimes identified leads to the following main findings: a) there was a major structural change in the transmission mechanism around January 2001, date that coincides with the formal adoption of the inflation targeting framework; b) after this change, fluctuations in the real exchange rate have had smaller effects on the process of price formation, the formation of inflation expectations and the nominal interest rate; c) also, there have been stronger reactions of the nominal interest rate to increases in the output gap and the rate of inflation; and d) the movements of the nominal interest rate have a more effective influence on the real exchange rate and the rate of inflation.

AB  - This article compares reactions of economies in Economic Monetary Union (EMU) to a single monetary policy. For that, we estimate a reaction function supposed to represent the behaviour of European Central Bank over the period 1980–1998. Then residuals are introduced into the production equation of each country. We break up monetary shocks in two axes: first, anticipated against unanticipated shocks and then positive against negative shocks. These distinctions permit a best evaluation of the degree of homogeneity of the effects of monetary policy. France, Germany, Spain and Austria seem more sensitive to unanticipated interest rates increases contrary to Belgium and Italy. These results illustrate all the problem of single monetary policy.

T2  - Journal of Money, Credit and Banking
AB  - I estimate the inflation/output-gap variance trade-off faced by monetary policy makers in the United States. For policy makers who care about the deviations of inflation around target and output around potential, the estimated trade-off represents the "optimal policy frontier." Given the structure of the economy, policy makers can do no better than to attain weighted variances of inflation and output that lie on the frontier. I find that the variance trade-off becomes quite severe when the standard deviation of inflation or output drops much below 2 percent. This suggests that approximately balanced responses to policy goals are consistent with reasonable preferences over inflation and output variability.

AB  - © 2021, Savez Ekonomista Vojvodine. All rights reserved.Summary: Relying on the Autoregressive Distributed Lag cointegration technique, this paper assesses the comparative effectiveness of the fiscal and monetary policy on output growth in Turkey for the period 2003:q1-2019:q1. The empirical evidence shows that both policies are effective in promoting output growth but with varying degrees, revealing that the impact of monetary policy on output growth is greater than that of fiscal policy. Overall, based on our empirical evidence, it can be suggested that the Turkish authorities should set sight on monetary policy to achieve higher output growth while seeking ways to improve the output growth-enhancing role of fiscal policy. To that end, among many others, budgetary flexibility can be increased through creating fiscal space and growthfriendly tax and spending reforms can be undertaken without jeopardizing the trade-off between growth and equity while giving priority to proper coordination of fiscal policy with monetary policy.

We hence oﬀer an alternative to using the recursive identiﬁcation with selected calibrated parameters, which is the main approach currently available. We use the model to study how the eﬀects of monetary policy shocks change over the business cycle. We show that ﬁnancial variables, inﬂation and output respond to a monetary shock more in a recession than in an expansion, in line with the predictions from the ﬁnancial accelerator literature.

AB  - The bond yield dynamics implied by a welfare-maximizing monetary policy and its credibility are explored in general equilibrium. Credibility is captured by a regime change from discretion to commitment. The policy determines the optimal output and inflation responses to a source of inflation risk. Bond yields contain compensations for this risk that depend on the policy. Credibility improvements reduce the exposure to inflation risk and bond risk premiums decline. A model calibration implies lower yield spreads, less volatile yields, and reduced deviations from the expectations hypothesis under commitment. The model suggests an explanation for changes in yield dynamics in the U.S. across different policy regimes.

T2  - International Review of Applied Economics
AB  - This paper analyzes monetary policy asymmetries in EMU participating countries. In particular, we use a structural dynamic modelling approach to investigate asymmetric monetary transmission in Europe. Asymmetries are investigated in two different ways. First, we restrict the estimated structural models reflecting the monetary constraints each country faced during the EMS period. We obtain well‐behaved and comparable effects of monetary policy shocks. Second, efficiency frontiers for the selected EMU countries are estimated. In computing the optimal combinations of output gap and inflation volatility we use a weighted average of interest rate and exchange rate, i.e. the Monetary Condition Index (MCI), as a policy instrument. The impulse response analysis implemented with the MCI shows relatively small differences in the responses of the real economy to monetary policy shocks. Altogether the results suggest that, no matter which policy instrument is used, output gap and inflation respond to identical monetary shocks with a similar speed and movement, albeit with a different degree of effect.

AB  - We assess to what extent decisions taken by the Federal Reserve in setting interest rates can be interpreted in the light of monetary policy rules that are either built on standard objectives of output and price stabilization or based on alternative objectives of financial stability and regulation of the solvency conditions in the economic system. This goal is pursued through a comparison between the “Taylor rule” in its “original” and “augmented” versions, and an alternative “Solvency rule”. We use nonperforming loans as a proxy for the conditions of financial stability and solvency in the system. The empirical investigation is carried out following a structural vector autoregressive approach that exploits a statistical identification procedure. In this way, we are able to identify the causal structure among variables without imposing theoretical restrictions on the model. Our empirical findings provide very limited and incomplete support for the Taylor rule in its various forms while give comprehensive evidence in favor of the alternative Solvency rule.

AB  - In this paper, we provide new empirical evidence on the relationship between short and long run interest rates for Germany. We find a positive correlation after a supply and demand shock and a negative correlation after a monetary policy shock. This finding is consistent with the theory of Ellingsen and Söderström [American Economic Review 2001;91(5):1594–1607].

T2  - Emerging Markets Review
AB  - This study explores asymmetric effects of monetary policy on firm scale at different firm size levels. We find that Chinese firms respond to raising benchmark lending interest rates and deposit reserve requirements by decreasing their scales. Our quantile regression results also indicate that larger firms respond more strongly to both policy instruments by adjusting their scales to a greater degree than smaller firms. Moreover, SOEs react less strongly to policy changes than non-SOEs at all firm size distribution. The impact of monetary policy on firm scale is also stronger after commercial banks having greater leeway in setting interest rates.

AB  - We develop a multi-sector Calvo model with intermediate inputs to study the quantitative importance of heterogeneities in price rigidities, sector size, and inputoutput linkages and their interaction for the real eﬀects of monetary policy shocks. We show theoretically real eﬀects are bigger if the share of intermediate inputs is high or if sticky-price sectors are important suppliers to the rest of the economy, to ﬂexible-price sectors, or to large sectors. Quantitatively, heterogeneity in inputoutput linkages contributes only marginally to the real eﬀects of monetary policy shocks, whereas heterogeneity in the frequency of price adjustment creates large real eﬀects of nominal shocks. Diﬀerences in consumption shares have an economically important eﬀect on the total real eﬀects. To reach those conclusions, we calibrate a 350-sector version of the model to the input-output tables from the Bureau of Economic Analysis and the micro-data underlying the producer price index from the Bureau of Labor Statistics to reach those conclusions. A less granular calibration with only 58 sectors understates the real eﬀects of monetary policy by 25%, with a similar impact response of inﬂation. The large real eﬀects reﬂect heterogeneity in price markups due to the diﬀerent heterogeneities and a higher average level of markups, fully driven by the product market wedge.

T2  - Journal of Monetary Economics
AB  - In this paper we study the role of the exchange rate in conducting monetary policy in an economy with near-zero nominal interest rates as experienced in Japan since the mid-1990s. Our analysis is based on an estimated model of Japan, the United States and the euro area with rational expectations and nominal rigidities. First, we provide a quantitative analysis of the impact of the zero bound on the effectiveness of interest rate policy in Japan in terms of stabilizing output and inflation. Then we evaluate three concrete proposals that focus on depreciation of the currency as a way to ameliorate the effect of the zero bound and evade a potential liquidity trap. Finally, we investigate the international consequences of these proposals.

T2  - Empirical Economics
AB  - We examine the effects of monetary policy on income inequality in Japan. For that purpose, we use a novel Bayesian approach that jointly estimates the Gini coefficient from grouped income data and the dynamics of macroeconomic quantities. Our results indicate different effects on income inequality for different types of households: A monetary tightening decreases inequality when we consider a broad definition of household data that also includes the unemployed and retirees. Higher unemployment and tighter borrowing conditions make the richer (i.e., employed) comparably worse off. The result reverses, if we focus on the subsample of households whose head is employed. Through the same channels, inequality increases if monetary policy is tightened. A counterfactual analysis reveals that indeed the financial channel and the job destruction channel are the most important transmission mechanisms.

AB  - The volatile data for inflation, output, and interest rates in the United Kingdom prior to the 1990s, and the relative macroeconomic stability associated with inflation targeting, provide a rich basis for discriminating between rival explanations for the outbreak of stagflation. We examine alternative hypotheses with a New Keynesian model of aggregate demand and inflation determination, estimated on quarterly UK data for 1959-2000. Our model features IS and Phillips curves based on optimizing behavior, and fully incorporates the distinction between detrended output and the output gap stressed by optimizing analysis. Using simulations of our model as well as information on the "real-time" views of policymakers, we test alternative explanations for the outbreak of inflation in the United Kingdom in the 1960s and 1970s. We find that inaccurate estimates of the degree of excess demand in the economy contributed significantly to the outbreak. But we also find a major role for the failure at the time to recognize the importance of monetary policy, as opposed to nonmonetary devices, in controlling inflation.

The model features nominal and real frictions, as well as financial frictions in the form of liquidity-constrained households. The model incorporates active monetary and fiscal policy rules (for government consumption, investment, transfers and wage taxes) and can be used to analyse the effectiveness of stabilisation policies. To capture the unit root character of macroeconomic time series we allow for a stochastic trend in TFP, but instead of filtering data prior to estimation, we estimate the model in growth rates and stationary nominal ratios.

AB  - This paper examines stock market efficiency with respect to money supply data by testing (1) regression models of stock returns on monetary variables and (2) trading rules based on money supply data. The evidence indicates no meaningful lag in the effect of monetary policy on the stock market and that no profitable security trading rules using past values of the money supply exist. Therefore this evidence is consistent with the efficient market model. Current security returns incorporate all information contained in past money supply data and, in addition, appear to anticipate future changes in the money supply. A number of previous studies have concluded that lags exist and can be used in profitable trading rules. Analysis of these studies demonstrates that for a variety of reasons the evidence in these past studies does not sustain such conclusions.

According to the empirical analysis results, monetary policy does not have a symmetrical effect on output. Asymmetric effects on the other hand valid from negative and positive shocks of monetary policy to positive and negative shocks of output respectively in the short and also in the long run.

AB  - The UK has experienced a dramatic increase in earnings and income inequality over the past four decades. We use detailed micro level information to construct quarterly historical measures of inequality from 1969 to 2012. We investigate whether monetary policy shocks played a role in explaining this increase in inequality. We find that contractionary monetary policy shocks lead to an increase in earnings, income and consumption inequality and contribute to their fluctuation. The response of income and consumption at different quantiles suggests that contractionary policy has a larger negative effect on low income households and those that consume the least when compared to those at the top of the distribution. Our evidence also suggests that the policy of quantitative easing may have contributed to the increase in inequality over the Great Recession.

AB  - This paper investigates both the effects of domestic monetary policy and external shocks on fundamental macroeconomic variables in six fast growing emerging economies: Brazil, Russia, India, China, South Africa and Turkey - denoted hereafter as BRICS_T. The authors adopt a structural VAR model with a block exogeneity procedure to identify domestic monetary policy shocks and external shocks. Their research reveals that a contractionary monetary policy in most countries appreciates the domestic currency, increases interest rates, effectively controls inflation rates and reduces output. They do not find any evidence of the price, output, exchange rates and trade puzzles that are usually found in VAR studies. Their findings imply that the exchange rate is the main transmission mechanism in BRICS_T economies. The authors also find that that there are inverse J-curves in five of the six fast growing emerging economies and there are deviations from UIP (Uncovered Interest Parity) in response to a contractionary monetary policy in those countries. Moreover, world output shocks are not a dominant source of fluctuations in those economies.

The results, based on impulse-response functions, provide no evidence of the price puzzle observed in traditional Structural Vector Autoregressive analysis and confirm that monetary policy in South Africa is effective in stabilising prices. Unlike the traditional vector autoregressive approach, the FAVAR methodology allows further analysis of a large number of variables. Variables from real and financial variables react negatively to a contractionary monetary policy shock. Finally, we find evidence of the importance of a confidence channel transmission following a monetary policy shock.

AB  - Existing research demonstrates that housing, particularly residential investment, plays an important role in the transmission of monetary policy shocks to the overall economy. With this in mind, this paper investigates the relationship between monetary policy and housing market activity using a relatively new method for identifying monetary shocks. More specifically, a monetary policy shock is identified by explicitly imposing sign restrictions on impulse response vectors. The extra information from sign restrictions is important for new insights regarding the transmission of monetary policy to the housing sector – notably, the results indicate that residential investment is less sensitive to a contractionary shock than standard estimates with recursive restrictions. Given that the response of the housing sector using sign restrictions is smaller than other work using standard identification methods, the work indicates that further research is needed to examine whether other sectors of the economy may be less sensitive to monetary policy than previously thought.

TI  - Evaluating simple monetary policy rules for Australia
AU  - de Brouwer, Gordon
AU  - O'Regan, James
AB  - Generally, the ultimate objectives of monetary policy are low and stable inflation and maximum sustainable economic growth. Central banks have increasingly sought to achieve these goals through the formulation of formal inflation targets. In pursuing such a target, most central banks use an overnight interest rate as the instrument of policy, but exactly how the instrument should be moved to achieve the objectives of policy is an issue of active debate. A number of simple interest-rate feedback rules have been proposed to assist in setting the overnight interest rate.  The aim of this paper is to analyse these rules in a simple but data-consistent framework of the Australian economy. We do this by trying to answer a number of questions. What sort of simple policy rule – for example, an inflation-only rule, Taylor rule or nominal-income rule – performs best? Given that the economy is subject to a variety of shocks, how much can policy stabilise the economy, and how steep is the trade-off between the variability of inflation and output? How do policy rules vary with changes in inflation expectations induced by the inflation target itself? Do simple rules which also let policy respond to other variables perform better than simple rules based on inflation and output alone? Finally, should policy rules be based on actual or expected values of the target variables?  The structure of the paper follows these questions. Section 2 reviews some terminology about feedback rules, and presents a simple empirical framework of the Australian economy which is used for analysis. Section 3 evaluates several interest-rate rules, and explores the properties of what appears to be the most efficient of these, the Taylor rule. Section 4 addresses how greater credibility can affect price-setting behaviour, and what this may mean for the economy and monetary policy. Section 5 examines whether information in addition to inflation and output improves the rule. Section 6 examines whether forward-looking, rather than backward-looking, rules more successfully stabilize the economy. The findings of the paper are summarised in Section 7.

AB  - We study the role of financial frictions and firm heterogeneity in determining the investment channel of monetary policy. Empirically, we find that firms with low default risk—those with low debt burdens and high “distance to default”— are the most responsive to monetary shocks. We interpret these findings using a heterogeneous firm New Keynesian model with default risk. In our model, low-risk firms are more responsive to monetary shocks because they face a flatter marginal cost curve for financing investment. The aggregate effect of monetary policy may therefore depend on the distribution of default risk, which varies over time.

We estimate directly the policy rule agents use to form their expectations by linking news' effects on forecasts of both economic conditions and monetary policy. Evidence between 1994 and 2007 indicates that the market-perceived Federal Reserve policy rule changed: the output response vanished, and the inflation response path became more gradual but larger in long-run magnitude. These response coefficient estimates are robust to measurement and theoretical issues with both potential output and the inflation target. (JEL C51, E31, E43, E52, E58)

AB  - We estimate that U.S. monetary policy has sizable spillover effects on global economic activity. In response to a surprise increase in the federal funds rate of 25 basis points, real output in our sample of 44 countries declines on average by 0.9% after three years. We find that international trade is a more important factor than international finance in explaining these spillovers. In particular, countries with a high share of exports and imports in output have 79% larger responses than countries with a low share, whereas we do not find significant heterogeneity depending on a country’s financial openness. Bilateral trade linkages appear to be quantitatively important, as the network amplification effect accounts for 45% of the total spillover effect at the peak horizon. We conclude that trade networks could be an important ingredient of theoretical models focusing on the international effects of U.S. monetary policy shocks.

AB  - This paper recasts Temin's (1976) question of whether monetary forces caused the Great Depression in a modern time series framework. We evaluate the effects of monetary policy against nonmonetary alternatives in a Bayesian updating framework with time-varying parameters. The predictive power of monetary policy for output is very small for the early phase of the depression and breaks down almost entirely after 1931. During the propagation phase of 1930-31, monetary policy is able to forecast correctly at short time horizons put invariably predicts recovery at longer horizons. In contrast, nonmonetary leading indicators on residential construction and equipment investment have impressive predictive power. Recursive calculation of the impulse response functions exhibits remarkable structural instability and strong reactions to monetary regime changes during the depression, just as predicted by the Lucas (1976) critique.

AB  - In this paper evidence is presented for Japan that an asymmetry exists between the effects of positive and negative money shocks on output. This result held over different lag lengths in the monetary variables, for different specifications of the call money rate equation, and when monetary policy was measured by the monetary base or by M2 + CD. Unanticipated money, unlike positive and negative shocks, was statistically insignificant in explaining output. Results reinforce findings for the United States that an asymmetry between the effects of unexpected expansionary and contractionary monetary policy may constitute an empirical regularity requiring further investigation. /// Effets d'une politique monétaire non prévue sur le niveau agrégé de production au Japon: le rôle des chocs positifs et négatifs. On montre qu'il existe une asymétrie entre les effets de chocs monétaires positifs et négatifs sur le niveau de production. Il semble que ce résultat soit robuste: il est observé tant dans les cas de délais de différentes longueurs, que pour différentes spécifications de l'équation du taux du marché monétaire ou pour des mesures différentes de la politique monétaire (base monétaire ou M2 + CD). Une politique monétaire non prévue, contrairement à des chocs positifs ou négatifs, s'est avérée statistiquement insignifiante pour expliquer la variation dans le niveau de production. Ces résultats supportent les résultats obtenus pour les Etats-Unis où on a montré que l'asymétrie entre les effets d'une politique monétaire non prévue expansionniste et restrictive peut être une régularité empirique qui mérite des études plus poussées.

TI  - A new approach to measuring economic policy shocks, with an application to conventional and unconventional monetary policy
AU  - Inoue, Atsushi
AU  - Rossi, Barbara
T2  - Quantitative Economics
AB  - We propose a new approach to analyze economic shocks. Our new procedure identifies economic shocks as exogenous shifts in a function; hence, we call them “functional shocks.” We show how to identify such shocks and how to trace their effects in the economy via VARs using “VARs with functional shocks” and “functional local projections.” Using our new procedure, we address the crucial question of studying the effects of monetary policy by identifying monetary policy shocks as shifts in the whole term structure of government bond yields in a narrow window of time around monetary policy announcements. Our approach sheds new light on the effects of monetary policy shocks, both in conventional and unconventional periods, and shows that traditional identification procedures may miss important effects. Our new procedure has the advantage of identifying monetary policy shocks during both conventional and unconventional monetary policy periods in a unified manner and can be applied more generally to other economic shocks.

TI  - The effect of conventional and unconventional monetary policy rules on inflation expectations: theory and evidence
AU  - Farmer, Roger E. A.
T2  - Oxford Review of Economic Policy
AB  - This paper has three parts. Part 1 constructs a classical economic model of inflation, augmented by a complete set of financial markets; I call this the core monetary model. Part 2 develops a series of calibrated examples to illustrate how the core monetary model explains the history of inflation after the Second World War, and Part 3 provides evidence to show that the unconventional monetary policy, followed in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis, was effective in stabilizing inflation expectations. The core monetary model provides a unified framework to explain how an interest rule can be used to control inflation in normal times, and to explain the purpose of unconventional monetary policy when policy attains the zero lower bound. I argue that management of the variation in the composition of the Fed’s balance sheet, is an important tool in a central bank’s arsenal that can be used to help prevent deflation in the wake of a financial crisis.

TI  - Monetary and fiscal policy effects in South African economy
AU  - Nuru, Naser Yenus
T2  - African Journal of Economic and Management Studies
AB  - Purpose The main purpose of this study is to see the macroeconomic effects of monetary and fiscal policy shocks in South Africa. Design/methodology/approach The joint effects of monetary and fiscal policy are analyzed by applying short-run contemporaneous restrictions for the identification of shocks in an SVAR in order to derive impulse response functions. Hence, a general AB model of (Amisano and Giannini, 1997) identification scheme, which is not recursive, is employed in this study. Findings The author shows that monetary tightening leads to a fall in real economic activity and depreciates the exchange rate. And in regard to the fiscal policy, the author calculates an initial government spending multiplier of 0.20, which later peaks at 0.40. The tax multiplier is almost 0 on impact and statistically insignificant. However, the author finds evidence supporting the existence of accommodative stance between monetary policy and fiscal policy, which is important for economic and political decision-making. Originality/value Empirical studies that deal with the joint effects of monetary and fiscal policy for South Africa through the SVAR framework are quite limited. This paper, therefore, contributes to the empirical literature on the effects of monetary and fiscal policy in a small open economy like South Africa.

TI  - Policy Matters: Economic and Social Policies to Sustain Equitable Development
AU  - Nations, United
AB  - Policy Matters advances the analytical debate in elaborating relevant economic and social policies to achieve more sustainable and equitable development in our times.Early chapters underscore the importance of ensuring equity, not only as a desirable end in itself, but also to enhance economic growth and ensure social stability and political security.The following chapters suggest that the promises of trade and financial liberalization have not been realized. Trade liberalization may well have worsened unemployment as well as working conditions besides undermining existing productive capacities and reducing the 'policy space' for developing better and competitive new economic capacities.Meanwhile, financial liberalization does not seem to have contributed to economic growth while exacerbating economic volatility, instability and crises. The debates on 'scaling up' aid and aid-induced 'welfare colonialism' as well as appropriate monetary and exchange rate policies are engaged. The issue of poverty programme targeting efficiency and the social policy debate on universalism versus targeting conclude this rich and important volume.

AU  - Pierdzioch, Christian
T2  - German Economic Review
AB  - I use a dynamic general equilibrium two-country optimizing model to analyze the implications of international capital mobility for the short-run effects of monetary policy in an open economy. The model implies that the substitutability of goods produced in different countries plays a central role for the impact of changes in the degree of international capital mobility on the effects of monetary policy. Paralleling the results of the traditional Mundell-Fleming model, a higher degree of international capital mobility magnifies the short-run output effects of monetary policy only if the Marshall-Lerner condition, which is linked to the cross-country substitutability of goods, holds.

AB  - I show that monetary policy divergence vis-a-vis the U.S. has larger spillover effects in emerging markets than advanced economies. The monetary policy of the U.S. affects domestic credit costs in other countries through its effect on global investors’ risk perceptions. Capital flows in and out of emerging market economies are particularly sensitive to fluctuations in such risk perceptions and have a direct effect on local credit spreads. Domestic monetary policy is ineffective in mitigating this effect as the pass-through of policy rate changes into short-term interest rates is imperfect. This disconnect between short rates and monetary policy rates is explained by changes in risk perceptions. A key policy implication of my findings is that emerging markets’ monetary policy actions designed to limit exchange rate volatility can be counterproductive.

TI  - The limited power of monetary policy in a pandemic
AU  - Lepetit, Antoine
AU  - Fuentes-Albero, Cristina
T2  - European Economic Review
AB  - We embed an extension of the canonical epidemiology model in a New Keynesian model and analyze the role of monetary policy as a virus spreads and triggers a sizable recession. In our framework, consumption is less sensitive to real interest changes in a pandemic than in normal times because individuals have to balance the benefits of taking advantage of intertemporal substitution opportunities with the risk of becoming sick. Accommodative monetary policies such as forward guidance result in large increases in inflation but have only limited effects on real economic activity as long as the risk of infection is large. The optimal design of monetary policy hinges on how other tools used to limit virus spread, such as lockdowns, are deployed. If the lockdown policy is conducted optimally, monetary policy should focus on keeping inflation on target. However, if the lockdown policy is not optimal, the central bank faces a trade-off between its objective of stabilizing inflation and the necessity to minimize the inefficiencies associated with virus spread.

AB  - This South African case study controls for the fiscal side of the economy using government borrowing as a potential accelerator of asymmetry in a monetary function that follows Taylor?s rule. Through the linear and non-linear ARDL framework, we find significant asymmetry effects of monetary policy on output and inflation, respectively. We also find government borrowing as an important underlying source of asymmetries in the response of macroeconomic fundamentals to monetary policy shocks in South Africa. Thus, we recommend that monetary authorities consider not only the effectiveness or otherwise of monetary policy instruments to affect the target policy goals, but also the fact that not all the target variables react in a similar way to expansionary and contractionary monetary policy shocks.

TI  - Recent developments in monetary policy analysis: the roles of theory and evidence
AU  - McCallum, Bennett T.
T2  - Journal of Economic Methodology
AB  - Both academic thinking about monetary economics and the practice of monetary policy have changed dramatically since 1971–3, when the rational expectations revolution was beginning and the Bretton Woods system was crumbling. The present paper considers whether the various changes that have taken place were influenced primarily by economic theory or by empirical evidence - or by a combination of the two. Monetary economics, like macroeconomics more generally, passed through the rational expectations period into one dominated by real business cycle (RBC) analysis, which denies monetary policy any significant role in the generation or the dampening of cyclical fluctuations in crucial real variables. Recently, however, the analysis of monetary policy by both academic and central bank economists has been increasingly conducted in small quantitative structural models that combine the optimizing aspect of RBC analysis with various assumptions implying real effects of monetary policy actions due to slow adjustment of nominal prices. These models therefore attempt to combine rather strict theoretical discipline with features that permit an enhanced degree of empirical veracity. It is apparent, accordingly, that both theoretical and empirical analysis have been essential in bringing about alterations in monetary policy analysis between 1971–3 and 1998.

To this end, I build a heterogeneous-agent New Keynesian economy with indivisible labor in which both macro and micro labor supply elasticities are endogenously generated. First, I find that monetary policy shocks have distributional consequences due to a substantial heterogeneity in labor supply elasticity across households. Second, a more equal economy is associated with more effective monetary policy in terms of output. I document supporting empirical evidence for the key mechanism of the model using microlevel data and state-level data in the United States.

AU  - Ahrend, Rudiger

AB  - This paper addresses the question of whether and how monetary policy ease may lead to excesses in financial and real asset markets and ultimately result in financial dislocation. It presents evidence suggesting that periods when short-term interest rates have been persistently and significantly below what Taylor rules would prescribe are correlated with increases in asset prices, especially as regards housing, though no systematic effects are identified on equity markets. Significant asset price increases, however, can also occur when interest rates are in line with Taylor rules, associated with periods of financial deregulation and/or innovation. The paper argues that accommodating monetary policy over the period 2002-2005, in combination with rapid financial market innovation, would seem in retrospect to have been among the factors behind the run-up in asset prices and consequent financial imbalances - the (partial) unwinding of which helped trigger the 2007 financial market turmoil. Moreover, the paper points out that in certain situations policy rates may be a rather blunt tool for dealing with both the build-up and aftermath of financial imbalances, raising the question whether "macro-prudential" regulation could be useful.

AU  - Carlstrom, Charles T.
AU  - Fuerst, Timothy S.
AB  - Every U.S. recession since 1971 has been preceded by two things: an oil price shock and an increase in the federal funds rate. Bernanke, Gertler, and Watson (1997, 2004) investigated how much oil price shocks have contributed to output growth by asking the following counterfactual question: Empirically how much would we expect oil price increases to have contributed to output growth if the Fed had kept the rate constant instead of letting it increase? They concluded that, at most, half of the observed output declines can be attributed to oil price increases. Most were actually caused by funds rate increases. A problem with their empirical analysis, however, is that it implicitly assumes that the Fed can continually "fool" the public. That is, the funds rate is led constant even though the public actually expects the Fed to follow its historical policy rule of raising the funds rate in conjunction with oil price increases. We show that if the new policy rule were anticipated oil price increases would have had a much larger impact on output than suggested by Bernanke, Gertler, and Watson's analysis.

Four major transmission channels are considered due to the economic and financial conditions of Nigeria. The study employs quarterly data from 2004:1 to 2016:4 and data are sourced from World Development Indicator (online version). Results show that financial development in the period under study has positive effect on monetary policy transmission channel. While credit channel is the most active channel in stimulating output, expectation channel is the most active in stabilizing prices.

AB  - We introduce banks, modeled as in Diamond and Rajan (JoF 2000 or JPE 2001), into a standard DSGE model and use this framework to study the role of banks in the transmission of shocks, the effects of monetary policy when banks are exposed to runs, and the interplay between monetary policy and Basel-like capital ratios. In equilibrium, bank leverage depends positively on the uncertainty of projects and on the bank's relationship lender skills, and negatively on short term interest rates. A monetary restriction reduces leverage, while a productivity or asset price boom increases it. Procyclical capital ratios are destabilising; monetary policy can only partly offset this effect. The best policy combination includes mildly anticyclical capital ratios and a response of monetary policy to asset prices or leverage.

AB  - The link between financial development and monetary policy has received considerable attention in many African countries but empirical evidence on the link has been mixed. By the use of the Autoregressive Distributed Lag (ARDL) approach, this study investigated whether financial development influences the effectiveness of monetary policy and assessed their joint effect on economic growth in Ghana for the period 1980 to 2016. The results revealed that financial development strengthens the effectiveness of monetary policy on economic growth in Ghana. The study therefore recommended that Bank of Ghana should further deepen financial sector development and improve on the competitiveness of financial markets in order to improve on the capacity of monetary policy in enhancing growth of the economy.

AB  - The paper analyses the problem of coordinating fiscal and monetary policies within an explicit game theoretic model of the interaction between different policy institutions. Specifically, the question is considered under (i) different institutional arrangements, (ii) different kinds of reaction of the two authorities, and (iii) different macroeconomic frameworks. The implications for inflation and output as well as the gains from cooperative policy decisions are considered.
