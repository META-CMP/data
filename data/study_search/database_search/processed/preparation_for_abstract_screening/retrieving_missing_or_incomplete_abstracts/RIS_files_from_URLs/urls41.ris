TI  - Monetary policy in Brazil: Evidence from new measures of monetary shocks♦
AU  - Costa, Adonias Evaristo da
T2  - Estudos Econômicos (São Paulo)
AB  - Abstract This paper derives new measures of monetary policy shocks for Brazil. First, one set of shocks is built inspired by Romer and Romer (2004) methodology, using official and private forecasts. Central Bank staff forecasts were collected from the technical presentations of monetary policy meetings, released after the introduction of the Access of Information Law, while private forecasts come from the Focus survey. Second, a yield curve shock is constructed for the Brazilian case, based on the Barakchian and Crowe (2013) methodology. Equipped with the shocks measures, I include them on VARs (Vector Autoregressions) and analyze the effects on inflation and output. A standardized monetary policy shock is found to reduce real GDP in up to 0.5%. In all but the yield curve shock case, it is found evidence of a price puzzle in the estimated models.

TI  - Decoupling at the Margin: The Threat to Monetary Policy from the Electronic Revolution in Banking
AU  - Friedman, Benjamin M.
AB  - The threat to monetary policy from the electronic revolution in banking is the possibility of a decoupling' of the operations of the central bank from markets in which financial claims are created and transacted in ways that, at some operative margin, affect the decisions of households and firms on such matters as how much to spend (and on what), how much (and what) to produce, and what to pay or charge for ordinary goods and services. The object of this paper is to discuss how this possibility arises and what it implies, to dismiss as unessential to the argument various extreme characterizations that have arisen in the recent debate on this issue (for example, that no one will use money for ordinary economic transactions), and to address the specific arguments on the issue offered by Charles Goodhart, Charles Freedman and Michael Woodford.

AB  - A vector autoregression with time-varying parameters is used to characterize changes in Federal Reserve policy that occurred from 2000 through 2007 and describe how they affected the performance of the U.S. economy. Declining coefficients in the model׳s estimated policy rule point to a shift in the Fed׳s emphasis away from stabilizing inflation over this period. More importantly, however, the Fed held the federal funds rate persistently below the values prescribed by this rule. Under this more discretionary policy, inflation overshot its target and the funds rate followed a path reminiscent of the “stop-go” pattern that characterized Fed behavior prior to 1979.

TI  - A Bound Test Analysis of Effects of Monetary Policy Shocks on Output and Prices in Nigeria 2000-2010
AU  - Tolulope, Apanisile Olumuyiwa
T2  - Journal of Economics and Behavioral Studies
AB  - The study examined the effects of monetary policy shocks on output and prices in Nigeria. This is done through an empirical analysis of the effects of anticipated and unanticipated monetary policies on output and prices. Quarterly data from 2000:1 to 2010:4 were used. The long-run ARDL estimates indicate positive and significant effects of anticipated monetary policy on output and prices while unanticipated monetary policy was insignificant. Thus, the findings provide a significant departure from the existing diversity of evidences of empirical literature on the monetary policy actions and macroeconomic variables nexus. The study therefore suggested the use of a one fit for all policy instrument in stimulating output growth and prices in the economy rather than using one specific measure which could lead to the failure of monetary policy in Nigeria.

AB  - A small model of the U.S. output-inflation nexus is used to examine the implications of two policy rules, one where the interest rate responds to contemporaneous inflation and one where the response is a forecast of future inflation. The model is asymmetric in that positive deviations of aggregate demand from potential are more inflationary than negative deviations are disinflationary. With asymmetry, following a myopic rule and allowing the economy to overheat requires deep or protracted recessions to control inflation, whereas following a forward-looking rule not only reduces volatility but also raises the equilibrium level of output.

AB  - We study a simple extension of the basic new‐Keynesian set‐up in which we relax the assumption of frictionless financial markets: due to asymmetric information and default risk, bank lending rates incorporate a spread over the deposit rate. We demonstrate that financial frictions affect aggregate dynamics mainly through their impact on firms’ financing costs, which increase in both the deposit rate and in the spread between lending and deposit rates. Welfare includes a concern for smoothing these two financial market variables. Our numerical simulations suggest that an aggressive easing of policy is optimal in response to adverse financial market shocks.

AU  - Aspachs-Bracons, Oriol

AB  - The recent boom-and-bust cycle in housing prices has refreshed the debate on the drivers of housing cycles as well as the appropriate policy response. We analyze the case of Spain, where housing prices have soared since it joined the EMU. We present evidence based on a VAR model, and we calibrate a New Keynesian model of a currency area with durable goods to explain it. We find that labor market rigidities provide stronger amplification effects to all type of shocks than financial frictions do. Finally, we show that when the central bank reacts to house prices, the non-durable sector suffers an important contraction. As a result, the boom-and-bust cycle would not have been avoided if Spain had remained outside the EMU during the 1996-2007 period.

AB  - Output gap estimates are subject to a wide range of uncertainty owing principally to the difficulty in distinguishing between cycle and trend in real time. We show that country desks tend to overestimate economic slack, especially during recessions, and that uncertainty in initial output gap estimates persists several years. Only a small share of output gap revisions is predictable based on output dynamics, data quality, and policy frameworks. We also show that for a group of Latin American inflation targeters the prescriptions from monetary policy rules are subject to large changes due to revised output gap estimates. These explain a sizable proportion of the deviation of inflation from target, suggesting this information is not accounted for in real-time policy decisions.

TI  - The Distributional Effects of Disinflationary Monetary Policy
AU  - Thorbecke, Willem
AB  - Macroeconomists traditionally focus on the aggregate consequences of disinflationary monetary policy, not its distributional effects. This paper considers these distributional effects. The evidence indicates that contractionary monetary policy harms interest rate-sensitive industries by depressing output and employment and increasing the cost of capital. These industries are further hurt as declines in output and increases in the cost of capital reduce capital formation. The evidence also indicates that tight monetary policy in 1981-82 decimated the earnings of small firms. These earnings have remained at low levels since then. Finally, the evidence indicates that wealth holders are helped by contractionary monetary policy as interest rates increase and inflation declines. Before tightening monetary policy to pursue these benefits, however, policy makers should weigh carefully the damage that they will inflict on interest-sensitive sectors and small firms.

TI  - Monetary policy and stock market dynamics across monetary regimes

T2  - Journal of International Money and Finance
AB  - This paper examines the dynamic linkages between monetary policy and the stock market during the three distinct monetary regimes of Burns, Volcker and Greenspan since the 1970s. Some major findings are the following. First, in the 1990s it appears that there was a disconnection between Federal Reserve actions (via the federal funds rate) and responses by the stock market. Second, the impact of inflation on the stock market did not surface as significant in the later parts of 1980s and the 1990s. And third, significant asymmetric effects of monetary policy on the stock markets were observed throughout each monetary regime but these were more pronounced during bear markets than bull markets. These results suggest that there was no consistent dynamic relationship between monetary policy and the stock market and that the nature of such dynamics was different in each of the three monetary regimes.

AB  - This paper analyzes the changes in the monetary policy transmission mechanism in Peru. A strong conclusion that emerges from this research is that both, the direct interest rate channel and the expectations channel have become more important in the recent years, especially after the Inflation Targeting adoption. The research further explores the implications of financial dollarization for the practice of monetary policy by performing two exercises. First, it compares different degrees of exchange rate flexibility and finds out that the more flexible the exchange rate is, the quicker but weaker the exchange rate pass-through becomes. Second, since financial dollarization may trigger contractionary depreciations, the document studies implications for monetary policy. The conclusion is that the effectiveness of monetary policy can be further improved if the economy becomes less dollarized.

AU  - Khundrakpam, Jeevan Kumar
AB  - The paper attempts to analyse asymmetric effects of monetary policy in India using quarterly data from 1996-97Q1 to 2011-12Q4. It finds that an unanticipated hike and an unanticipated cut in policy rate have a symmetric impact of on real GDP growth, but differentially impact the components of real aggregate demand. While the impact on real investment is symmetric, it is asymmetric on real private and government consumption in that while an unanticipated cut in policy rate leads to their increase, an unanticipated hike in policy rate has no impact on them. The impact on inflation is also symmetric. An anticipated policy rate change also has a negative impact on real GDP growth as well as on the components of real aggregate demand, except for real government consumption. However, there are ranges where anticipated policy rate changes become neutral to components of aggregate demand and, thus, on inflation, ranging from 6.25 per cent to 7.0 per cent.

We argue that the presence of substantial debt in fixed-rate, prepayable mortgages means that the ability to stimulate the economy by cutting interest rates depends not just on their current level but also on their previous path. Using a household model of mortgage prepayment matched to detailed loan-level evidence on the relationship between prepayment and rate incentives, we argue that recent interest rate paths will generate substantial headwinds for future monetary stimuli.

AB  - This paper presents an agent-based integrated model of a real,
financial, and monetary economy. The model is characterized by a monopolist firm that supplies a single homogeneous product in the goods market,
hires workers in the labor market, and demands loans in the credit market;
a trade union that sets the nominal wage; N heterogeneous households that
buy the consumption good, provide the labor force, and trade the firm’s
equity in the stock market; and a bank that lends money to the firm at an
interest rate set according to a monetary policy strategy. The model is used
to perform monetary policy experiments. A monetary policy rule which targets the gap between the current output and the potential output in the
full employment case is investigated, studying the effects on the economy for different degrees of policy tightness. The monetary policy rule is compared to a random policy rule that conserves a similar structure. Results
show that a tight monetary policy clearly outperforms the random policy
rule. Moreover, results corroborate the effectiveness of monetary policy in
limiting inflation and increasing welfare.

AB  - In this study, the empirical effect of monetary policy tools on performance of the Nigerian capital market was re-examined. The real effect of monetary policy tools on capital market performance is still not clear both from theoretical and empirical background, especially in emerging economies like Nigeria. Explicitly, this study evaluated the effect of monetary policy rate (the rate at the Central Bank of Nigeria extend credit facility to other financial institutions operating in the country), cash reserve ratio, liquidity ratio and loan to deposit ratio on the performance of the Nigerian capital market. Nigerian Stock Exchange and Central Bank of Nigeria annual reports of various edition supplied the relevant data for analysis. The Autoregressive Distributive Lag (ARDL) was the technique applied in estimating the model and for co-integration assessment, while granger causality analysis aided in ascertaining the effect of monetary policy tools on capital market performance. The result of the analysis illustrated that monetary policy tools and capital market performance in Nigeria are not co-integrated. The study also found that Nigerian capital market performance is not significantly affected by monetary policy announcement by the Central Bank of Nigeria rather, it is monetary policy rate that is significantly influenced by performance of the capital market. Based on the application of a superior methodology by way of ARDL in data analysis, the Central Bank of Nigeria should be cautious and properly consider the prevailing macroeconomic condition in monetary policy decision, especially with regard to liquidity ratio because of its potential in fueling or deterring inflation which affects prices of stocks in the capital market.

AB  - Financial development impacts a country’s economic growth and development. Due to this, many nations have sought new ways to bring about financial sector development. For developing economies, innovations in the financial sector are a sure bet for the development of financial inclusion. Mobile money is one of them. However, as the financial sector innovate, the Central Bank may lose control, rendering monetary policy ineffective. Therefore, this study examines one such innovation’s effect on monetary policy effectiveness. Using SVAR and monthly data spanning from January 2012 to December 2018, the study found that monetary policy becomes less effective under mobile money growth. The study further revealed that policy rates respond to mobile money growth in Ghana. In conducting monetary policy in Ghana, the study recommends that the monetary policy authority includes mobile money activity.

AB  - We study empirically the macroeconomic effects of an explicit de jure quantitative goal for monetary policy. Quantitative goals take three forms: exchange rates, money growth rates, and inflation targets. We analyze the effects on inflation of both having a quantitative target and hitting a declared target. Our empirical work uses an annual data set covering 42 countries between 1960 and 2000, and takes account of other determinants of inflation (such as fiscal policy, the business cycle, and openness to international trade) and the endogeneity of the monetary policy regime. We find that both having and hitting quantitative targets for monetary policy is systematically and robustly associated with lower inflation. The exact form of the monetary target matters somewhat (especially for the sustainability of the monetary regime) but is less important than having some quantitative target. Successfully achieving a quantitative monetary goal is also associated with less volatile output.

TI  - The effectiveness of fiscal and monetary policy during the financial crisis
AU  - Fetai, Besnik
AB  - The objective of this paper is to assess the effectiveness of monetary and fiscal policy on economic growth during the financial crisis in developing and emerging countries. Applying the dataset provided by Leaven and Valencia (2008 and 2010), I examine 83 financial crisis episodes in 66 developing and emerging countries. Employing the method utilized by Gupta at al., (2007), Baldacci at al., (2009), Hutchison (2010) and Li and Tang (2010), I performed the monetary and fiscal variables in order to control various determinants of output cost during the financial crisis. Applying different techniques OLS with robust standard errors and GMM estimator, I find out that monetary and fiscal policy contractions are associated with an increase of the output cost during the financial crisis. In addition, fiscal policy expansion is accompanied with smaller output cost over the financial crisis, whereas monetary expansion has no showed a clear effect. The macroeconomic policy mix with a discretionary fiscal expansion and a neutral monetary policy are likely to mitigate output cost during the financial crisis in developing and emerging countries.

TI  - Monetary Policy Instrument and Inflation in South Africa: Structural Vector Error Correction Model Approach
AU  - Bonga-Bonga, Lumengo
AU  - Kabundi, Alain
AB  - Since the adoption of inflation rate targeting policy, there has been a great concern on the effectiveness of monetary policy to curb inflation in South Africa. The effectiveness of the repo rate as a policy instrument to control the level of inflation has been widely criticised not only in the South African context but also internationally. With the critics pointing out from a substantial lag for monetary policy changes to affect inflation to the inability of the policy instrument to effectively affect inflation level. In assessing the effectiveness of the monetary policy in South Africa, this paper makes use of the structural vector error correction model (SVECM) to characterise the dynamics of inflation to monetary policy shocks. The results of the impulse response function obtained from the SVECM   found that while positive shocks to monetary policy decrease output but do not decrease credit demand and inflation in South Africa.

AU  - García, Clara

T2  - The Developing Economies
AB  - The exchange market pressure (EMP) against a currency has been frequently measured as the sum of the loss of international reserves plus the loss of nominal value of that currency. This paper follows the tradition of investigating the interactions between such a measure of EMP and monetary policy; but it also questions the usual omission of output growth in empirical investigations. The focus of this work is Argentina between 1993 and 2004. As in previous studies, we found some evidence of a positive and double-direction relationship between EMP and domestic credit. But output growth also played a role in the determination of EMP, even more than domestic credit or interest rates. Also, there is some evidence that EMP affected growth negatively.

TI  - Effects of Monetary Policy Shocks in Slovakia
AU  - Jurašeková Kucserová, Judita
AB  - This paper presents the results of empirical investigation into Slovak monetary policy shocks’ impacts on the economy. For estimating purposes, structural VAR based impulse responses of output, prices, exchange rates and short-term interest rates on structural disturbances selected by sign restrictions are studied. In most cases, to improve the quality of monetary policy shock definition, additional identification of historical shocks is provided. As a conclusion, unanticipated 50 basis points increase of the key interest rate lowers prices by up to 0.4% against the baseline. As expected, peak response is reached about one year after the shock at the latest. However, the effect on output is conflicting, suggesting that variations in monetary policy account for little variation in output.

AB  - The Global Financial Crisis has reopened discussions on the role of the monetary policy in preserving financial stability. Determining whether monetary policy affects financial variables domestically—especially compared to the effects of macroprudential policies— and across borders, is crucial in this context. This paper looks into these issues using U.S. exogenous monetary policy shocks and macroprudential policy measures. Estimates indicate that monetary policy shocks have significant and persistent effects on financial conditions and can attenuate long-term financial instability. In contrast, the impact of macroprudential policy measures is generally more immediate but shorter-lasting. Also, while an exogenous increase in U.S. monetary policy rates tends to reduce credit and house prices in other countries—with the effects varying with country-specific characteristics—an increase driven by improved U.S. economic conditions tends to have the opposite effect. Finally, we do not find evidence of cross-border spillover effects associated with U.S. macroprudential policies.

T2  - Review of Economic Dynamics
AB  - This paper addresses two substantive issues: (1) Does the magnitude of the expectation effect of regime switching in monetary policy depend on a particular policy regime? (2) Under which regime is the expectation effect quantitatively important? Using two canonical DSGE models, we show that there exists asymmetry in the expectation effect across regimes. The expectation effect under the dovish policy regime is quantitatively more important than that under the hawkish regime. These results suggest that the possibility of regime shifts in monetary policy can have important effects on rational agents' expectation formation and on equilibrium dynamics. They offer a theoretical explanation for the empirical possibility that a policy shift from the dovish regime to the hawkish regime may not be the main source of substantial reductions in the volatilities of inflation and output.

AB  - We estimate a logit mixture vector autoregressive model describing monetary policy transmission in the euro area over the period 1999–2015. In contrast to other classes of nonlinear vector autoregressive models, regime affiliation is neither strictly binary, nor binary with a transition period, and based on multiple variables. We show that monetary policy transmission in the euro area can be described as a mixture of two states. In both states, output and prices are found to decrease after contractionary monetary policy shocks. However, the effects of monetary policy are less enduring in the “crisis state.”

AB  - This paper investigates in a consistent semi-structural empirical framework three current issues of monetary policy in the euro area. First, regarding policy transmission we offer a three-stage procedure to combine the estimation of economic structure prior to EMU with current ECB monetary policy. Second, we test whether the regime change leads – before or after – EMU to structural instability. Third, we investigate the stance of monetary policy in Europe. We compare a “counterfactual” ECB reaction function based on average interest rates prior to EMU with actual ECB policy. Furthermore, we analyse actual ECB policy with interest rate projections using Bundesbank reaction functions and euroland data.

AB  - This paper empirically investigates the Taylor curve volatility tradeoff in light of the stochastic behavior of the conditional variances of output and inflation. Stressing structural instability between periods before and after the 1979-1982 monetary policy regime change, I implement a bivariate generalized autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity model to capture the output-inflation variability tradeoff and to explore the plausible impact of a change in the federal funds rate on the two conditional volatilities. I further evaluate the impacts of anticipated and unanticipated policy actions measured by two alternative policy reaction functions—one from a vector-autoregression-based reduced-form equation and another based on the Taylor rule. In addition to showing a volatility tradeoff relationship, the empirical model reveals different magnitudes of policy effects on output and inflation volatility across the two sample periods.

In the light of this critique, the model is reformulated, with its basic structure intact, but with alternative post-Keynesian specifications of the Phillips curve being considered. It is shown that such modifications, either allow a long run trade-off between the rate of inflation and the level of output, the rate of capacity utilization and, therefore, unemployment, or, in our preferred specification, changes in output and capacity have no implications for inflation over a large range of capacity utilization.

TI  - The Risk Channel of Monetary Policy
AU  - de Groot, Oliver
AB  - This paper examines how monetary policy affects the riskiness of the financial sector's aggregate balance sheet, a mechanism referred to as the risk channel of monetary policy.  I study the risk channel in a DSGE model with nominal frictions and a banking sector that can issue both outside equity and debt, making banks' exposure to risk an endogenous choice, and dependent on the (monetary) policy environment. Banks' equilibrium portfolio choice is determined by solving the model around a risk-adjusted  steady state. I find that banks reduce their reliance on debt finance and decrease leverage when monetary policy shocks are prevalent. A monetary policy reaction function that responds to movements in bank leverage or to movements in credit spreads can incentivize banks to increase their use of debt finance and increase leverage, ceteris paribus, increasing the riskiness of the financial sector for the real economy.

AB  - The paper is concerned with the role of monetary policy and argues that activist monetary policy can affect the behavior of real output, rational expectations notwithstanding. A rational expectations model with overlapping labor contracts is constructed, with each labor contract being made for two periods. These contracts inject an element of short-run wage stickiness into the model. Because the money stock is changed by the monetary authority more frequently than labor contracts are renegotiated, and, given the assumed form of the labor contracts, monetary policy has the ability to affect the short-run behavior of output, though it has no effects on long-run output behavior.

AB  - Estimates of the Taylor rule using historical data from the past decade or two suggest that monetary policy in the U.S. can be characterized as having reacted in a moderate fashion to output and inflation gaps. In contrast, the parameters of optimal Taylor rules derived using empirical models of the economy often recommend much more vigorous policy responses. This paper attempts to match the historical policy rule with an optimal policy rule by incorporating uncertainty into the derivation of the optimal rule and by examining plausible variations in the policymaker's model and preferences.

T2  - Applied Economics
AB  - This paper seeks to examine the role of monetary policy as an instrument for growth in the Ghanaian economy. The study was conducted based on yearly data from 1983 to 2017. Economic growth was the regressand in the study, with money supply, inflation, and the lending rate as the regressors. The ARDL bounds test technique was employed to investigate cointegration among the variables. The results confirmed the presence of cointegration among the variables. The results also showed the money supply as having a significant positive effect on growth in Ghana in the long run but a significant negative effect on growth in the short run. The lending rate however, was found to have an insignificant negative effect on growth in the long run but a significant positive effect on growth in the short run. Therefore, on the basis of the research findings, it is recommended that money supply be regulated in such a way that it does not lead to uncontrollable inflation, as inflation has a significant negative impact on economic growth at least in the short run, while persistent inflation in the long run is inimical to economic growth. It is further recommended that the lending rate be managed properly in order for investment to be accelerated to boost economic growth.

AB  - The present paper investigates the effect of monetary policy shocks upon the equity returns of financially constrained and less-constrained firms in Malaysia for the 1990-2008 period using firm-level data. Monetary policy shocks are generated via a recursive structural VAR (SVAR) identification scheme that allows the monetary authority to set the overnight interbank rate after observing the current value of world oil price, foreign income, foreign monetary policy, domestic output and inflation. The Malaysian firms examined are divided into two categories based upon the cash flow to income ratio, namely financially constrained and financially less-constrained. After augmenting the Fama and French (1992, 1996) multifactor model using a dynamic panel data approach, the results reveal that equity returns of financially constrained firms are more affected by domestic monetary policy than the returns of less constrained firms. Meanwhile, international monetary policy shocks significantly influence the equity returns of financially less-constrained firms, but not those of financially constrained firms.

TI  - The asymmetric reaction of monetary policy to inflation and the output gap: Evidence from Canada
AU  - Komlan, Fiodendji
T2  - Economic Modelling
AB  - This paper empirically analyzes the interest rate behavior of the Canadian monetary authorities by taking into account possible asymmetries in the loss function. We employ a switching regime framework using two estimation strategies: First, we follow Caner and Hansen's (2004) threshold approach. Under this procedure we estimate, using the Taylor empirical rules, the threshold values. Second, to infer the monetary policy preferences and have the best interpretation of the parameters, we use these threshold values to estimate the specification of asymmetric policy reaction function following Favero and Rovelli's (2003) approach. The results reveal that the Canadian monetary authorities showed asymmetric preferences; hence its reaction function can be better modeled as a nonlinear model. The results also imply that the monetary authorities' preferences have changed between different subperiods and different regimes. In particular, the parameter associated with the implicit target of inflation has been reduced significantly. We find strong statistical support for this decline, a result that is consistent with previous findings by Favero and Rovelli (2003) for the case of US and Rodríguez (2008) for Canada. The main contribution of this paper is to make out the presence of nonlinearities and asymmetries in the Canadian reaction function and to be able to interpret the parameters associated with the preferences of the central bank. This provides empirically interesting extension to Rodriguez (2008).

TI  - The Effect of Monetary Policy on Bank Wholesale Funding
AU  - Choi, Dong Beom
AU  - Choi, Hyun-Soo
T2  - Management Science
AB  - We study how monetary policy affects the funding composition of the banking sector. When monetary tightening reduces the supply of retail deposits, banks attempt to substitute wholesale funding for deposit outflows to smooth their lending. Because of financial frictions, banks have varying degrees of access to wholesale funding. Therefore, large banks, or those with greater reliance on wholesale funding, increase their wholesale funding more. Consequently, monetary tightening increases both the reliance on and the concentration of wholesale funding within the banking sector. Our findings also suggest that liquidity requirements could bolster monetary policy transmission through the bank lending channel.

AB  - This paper empirically investigates the following three questions: (i) Do stock returns respond to monetary policy shocks? (ii) Do stock returns alter the transmission mechanism of monetary policy? and (iii) Does monetary policy systematically react to stock returns? Unlike existing empirical research on these topics, we use a structural vector auto-regression that relaxes the restrictions commonly imposed in earlier studies and identify monetary policy shocks by exploiting the conditional heteroskedasticity of the structural innovations. Applying this method to US data, we find that the interaction between monetary policy and stock returns is much weaker than suggested by earlier empirical studies.

В данной работе с помощью эконометрических моделей демонстрируется наличие асимметричной реакции инфляции и выпуска в экономике Армении на позитивные и негативные шоки ДКП равного размера. Сдерживающая ДКП замедляет инфляцию меньше, чем ее ускоряет стимулирующая ДКП. Объем выпуска реагирует противоположным образом. Оцениваемая DSGE-модель малой открытой экономики с жесткими ценами и издержками изменения инвестиций объясняет около половины асимметрии, наблюдаемой в трансмиссионном механизме ДКП. В работе показано, что асимметричная реакция инфляции в основном является результатом сильно выпуклой кривой Филлипса импортеров. Нелинейные характеристики домашней экономики объясняют преобладающую часть асимметрии в реакции выпуска.

T2  - Verslas: teorija ir praktika
AB  - The existence of non-inclusive households significantly reduces the effect of the interest rate change policy on households inter-temporal consumption decisions. Further, financial inclusion is closely related to fintech. On the one hand, fintech helps overcome the financial inclusion problem because fintech manages to reach those who were previously inaccessible by banks. On the other hand, fintech will change the payment system structure in an economy that will eventually affect the effectiveness of monetary policy. Using the Vector Error Correction Model (VECM) with the observation period of 2009–2018, this study aims to analyze the effects of financial inclusion and fintech on effectiveness of the Indonesian monetary policy within the framework of the transmission mechanism of monetary policy through interest rate channel with both the cost of capital effect and the substitution effect. The results demonstrate that financial inclusion level affects inflation rate as a proxy of effectiveness of the Indonesian monetary policy, both in the short run and long run. However, the effect of shocks in financial inclusion on inflation is not permanent. Meanwhile, fintech only affects inflation rate in the short run. However, shocks in fintech affect the volatility of inflation rate is permanent both through the substitution effect and the cost of capital effect.

AB  - We estimate perceptions about the Fed's monetary policy rule from micro data on professional forecasters. The perceived rule varies significantly over time, with important consequences for monetary policy and bond markets. Over the monetary policy cycle, easings are perceived to be quick and surprising, while tightenings are perceived to be gradual and data-dependent. Consistent with the idea that forecasters learn about the policy rule from policy decisions, the perceived monetary policy rule responds to high-frequency monetary policy surprises. Variation in the perceived rule impacts financial markets, explaining changes in the sensitivity of interest rates to macroeconomic announcements and affecting risk premia on long-term Treasury bonds. It also helps explain forecast errors for the future federal funds rate. We interpret these findings through the lens of a model with forecaster heterogeneity and learning from observed policy decisions.

AB  - A unified model of monetary policy and bank regulation is presented.  In accordance with modern banking theory, banks not only intermediate loans and deposits but also provide a financial service affecting aggregate output.  Optimal parameter settings for monetary and regulatory policy are derived.  New results are that monetary policy affects the expected level as well as the variance of output, bank regulation should change continually in response to the state of the economy, and bank regulation and monetary policy should be tightly coordinated.  This last result has important implications for the institutional arrangements for conducting regulatory and monetary policy.

We begin with a discussion of rules versus discretion. We then examine the issue of the central bank’s independence (CBI) both in normal times and in times of crisis. Then we review the literature of electoral manipulation of policies. Finally we address international institutional issues concerning the feasibility, optimality, and political sustainability of currency unions in which more than one country shares the same currency. A brief review of the Euro experience concludes the paper.

AB  - Unconventional monetary policy (UMP) may make the effective lower bound (ELB) on the short-term interest rate irrelevant. We develop a theoretical model that underpins our empirical test of this `irrelevance hypothesis' based on the simple idea that under the hypothesis, the short rate can be excluded in any empirical model that accounts for alternative measures of monetary policy. We test the hypothesis for Japan and the United States using a structural vector autoregressive model with the ELB. We firmly reject the hypothesis but find that UMP has had strong delayed effects.

AB  - It is currently popular to identify monetary policy shocks with innovations in some measure of reserves or in the federal funds rate. These assumptions about the interest elasticity of the supply of or demand for reserves imply monetary policy shocks that produce dynamic responses of macroeconomic variables that are anomalous relative to traditional monetary analyses. This paper tentatively identifies supply and demand shocks in the markets for reserves and M2 for the 1980s and contrasts them with results for the 1970s. In the later period, identified monetary policy shocks have dynamic impacts that are fully consistent with traditional analyses.

AU  - Darby, Michael R.
T2  - Economic Inquiry
AB  - Standard analysis of monetary policy effects on interest rates in terms of liquidity, income, and expectations effects is incomplete. After a change in monetary policy, substitution among securities will increase as time elapses and so reduce or eliminate financial effects caused by short-run financial market segmentation. Also, the standard expectations effect omits the transfer of income tax liability on that part of the interest payment representing a return of real capital. So a 1 percentage point increase in the expected inflation rate should increase the nominal interest rate by 1/(1 —τ) percentage points, τ being the marginal tax rate.

This view, however, ignores possible asymmetries on more disaggregate levels of the economy, which could in turn lead to asymmetric effects of monetary policy across economic entities, such as sec tors of the economy, or regions.

AB  - The aim of this paper is to review the experience of various dual-currency economies and analyze the main challenges faced by policymakers in formulating and conducting monetary policy. To that end, it distinguishes between countries with growing dollarization and those which have managed to revert such trend. In addition to the Asian countries of interest we look at a number of Latin American countries, Israel and Russia. All of this countries have experienced – and in some cases still do – a high degree of dollarization. Though there are several other countries within Central and Eastern Europe where a hard currency, i.e. the euro, is frequently used for financing and saving purposes, an important difference of this region and the ASEAN countries in transition, is that the latter are nowhere close to adopting the dollar as an official currency or to enter a monetary union. Israel is chosen as a case study, because it is one of the few countries in the world that were highly dollarized, and could succesfully de-dollarize. Also Russia, has been trying to de-dollarize in the last couple of years. However, as we will discuss below they did not manage to lower the deposit dollarization ratio on a sustained basis.

Studies show that CBN Monetary Policy measures are effective in regulating both the monetary and real sector aggregates such as employment, prices, level of output and the rate of economic growth. Empirical findings from this study indicate that average price and labour force have significant influence on Gross Domestic Product while money supply was not significant. Interest rate was negative and statistically significant. It is therefore, recommended that Central Bank Monetary Policy could be an effective tool to encourage investment, reduce unemployment, reduce lending rate and stabilize the economy of Nigeria.

T2  - Research in International Business and Finance
AB  - Ever since the collapse of the Bretton-Woods system, gold has retained its function as an important monetary commodity (Baur and Lucey, 2010), and continues to provide important inflation forecasting information to monetary policy setters (Tkacz, 2007). However, Capie et al. (2005) highlight the instability of gold price dynamics through time, attributing it to unpredictable political attitudes and events. In this paper, we investigate gold price dynamics under different inflation regimes and stock market conditions using UK and US index-linked Treasury bond data. We show that gold lost its role as an inflation hedge after May 1997 in the UK, and after 2003 did not act as an inflation hedge in the US, supporting the argument that gold is an inflation hedge only in periods of high inflation and inflation expectations. Further, we show that gold retained its safe haven status throughout the sample period in both countries, but it did not act as a stock market hedge in the UK except during the 2008-9 global financial crisis. Finally, we conduct an event-study analysis of the impact of QE announcements from four leading central banks on the gold price in US dollars. While the QE announcements of the US Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank exerted a strong and weak influence on gold, respectively, the Bank of England and the Bank of Japan’s QE announcements had no discernible impact on the gold price.

AB  - Monetary policy is one of the two principal means (the other being fiscal policy) by which government authorities in a market economy regularly influence the pace and direction of overall economic activity, importantly including not only the level of aggregate output and employment but also the general rate at which prices rise or fall. The ability of central banks to carry out monetary policy stems from their monopoly position as suppliers of their own liabilities, which banks in turn need (either as legally required reserves or as balances for settling interbank claims) in order to create the money and credit used in everyday economic transactions. Important developments both in research and in the actual conduct of monetary policy in recent decades have revolved around the choice of a short-term interest rate versus a reserve quantity as the central bank's direct operating instrument, whether to use some measure of money as an intermediate target, whether to constrain the central bank to follow some fairly simple policy rule, what degree of political independence a central bank should have, and whether to target inflation. Some key areas of ongoing research in this area, as of the beginning of the 21st century, are whether the behavioral process by which monetary policy affects nonfinancial economic activity centers more on money or on credit, quantitative measurement of whatever is the mechanism at work, the trade-off between price inflation and real aspects of economic activity like output and employment, and just why it is that the public in most industrialized countries is as averse to inflation as is apparently the case.

AB  - This paper has two objectives: the first is to jointly analyse monetary and fiscal policy with a structural VAR model, evaluate the dynamic impact of policy shocks on U.S. output and prices and the contributions of these two sources to fluctuations in these variables. The second objective is to investigate if and how the effects of monetary policy are altered by the inclusion of fiscal policy variables in a benchmark monetary VAR. It is found that both monetary policy and fiscal policy have small effects on output and the price level and that neither of these shocks are important sources of fluctuations in either variable. The magnitude of the responses of output and prices to a monetary policy shock and the contribution of these shocks are reduced significantly once fiscal policy is introduced.

TI  - How Should Monetary Policy be Conducted in an Era of Price Stability?
AU  - Svensson, Lars E.O.
AB  - The paper discusses several issues related to how monetary policy should be conducted in an era of price stability. Low inflation (with base drift in the price level) and price-level stability (without such base drift) are compared, and a suitable loss function (corresponding to flexible inflation targeting) is discussed, including the index and level for the inflation target. Three ways of maintaining price stability are examined, namely (1) a commitment to a simple instrument rule, (2) "forecast targeting," and (3) monetary targeting. Both (1) and (3) are found to be inferior to forecast targeting in maintaining price stability. The benefits of credibility (private inflation expectations coinciding with the inflation target) are discussed. Credibility improves the tradeoff between inflation variability, output-gap variability and instrument variability and makes it easier for the central bank to meet its inflation target. The threat of deflation and a liquidity trap is examined. Transparent inflation targeting and a contingency plan with emergency measures, including a coordinated fiscal and monetary expansion, are likely to avoid a liquidity trap, but also contribute to escaping from one if already trapped.

AB  - A striking fact about pricing is the prevalence of "sales": large temporary price cuts followed by prices returning to exactly their former levels. This paper builds a macroeconomic model with a rationale for sales based on firms facing customers with different price sensitivities. Even if firms can adjust sales without cost, monetary policy has large real effects owing to sales being strategic substitutes: a firm's incentive to have a sale is decreasing in the number of other firms having sales. Thus the flexibility seen in individual prices due to sales does not translate into flexibility of the aggregate price level. (JEL E13, E31, E52, L11, L25, L81, M31)

TI  - Monetary policy and price level determinacy in a cash-in-advance economy
AU  - Woodford, Michael
T2  - Economic Theory
AB  - The paper considers the determinacy of the equilibrium price level in the cash-in-advance monetary economy of Lucas and Stokey (1983, 1987), in the case of deterministic “fundamentals”. The possibilities both of a multiplicity of perfect foresight equilibria and of “sunspot equilibria” are considered. Two types of monetary policy regimes are considered and compared, one in which the money supply grows at a given exogenous rate (that may be positive or negative), and one in which the nominal interest rate on one-period government debt is pegged at a given non-negative level. In the case of constant money growth rate regimes, it is shown that one can easily have both indeterminacy of perfect foresight equilibrium and existence of sunspot equilibria; indeed, in the case of negative rates of money growth (as called for by Friedman (1969)), both types of indeterminacy necessarily occur. On the other hand, sufficient conditions for uniqueness of equilibrium (and non-existence of equilibria other than a deterministic steady state) are also given, and a class of cases is identified in which a sufficiently high rate of money growth guarantees this. Thus there may be a conflict between the aims of choosing a rate of money growth that results in a high level of welfare in the steady state equilibrium and choosing a rate that makes this steady state the unique equilibrium.) In the case of the interest rate pegging regimes, sufficient conditions are given for uniqueness of equilibrium (and impossibility of sunspot equilibria), and it is shown that these necessarily hold in the case of any low enough nominal interest rate. Thus the nominal interest rate peg allows simultaneous achievement of price level determinacy and a high level of welfare in the unique (steady state) equilibrium.

AB  - In this paper we perform a meta-analysis of the effects of monetary policies on output and prices. We use a sample of published papers on the effects of monetary policies in different countries. There is a large variation in the estimated effects of monetary policies on output and prices. We find that the use of different econometric methodologies is an important variable explaining these differences. In addition, we analyze the importance of macroeconomic variables. Thus we find that in countries with high inflation, the output effects of monetary policies are significantly reduced. A lot of variation in the estimated effects of monetary policies remains unexplained. More research will have to be done to understand these large differences.

AB  - This paper develops a simple framework to examine the budgetary implications of monetary policy measures. It further outlines, using this framework, the various channels of influence that tight monetary policy may have on the budget deficit. The cumulative effect might be quantitatively large although each effect might be small. Most of the effects tend to increase the budget deficit as result of tight monetary policy, but tight monetary policy causes a short-run decrease in the government debt. Thus, macroeconomic policy coordination should be considered.

AB  - This paper reconsiders the Phelps-Lucas hypothesis, according to which temporary real effects of purely nominal disturbances result from imperfect information, but departs from the assumptions of Lucas (1973) in two crucial respects. Due to monopolistically competitive pricing, higher-order expectations are crucial for aggregate inflation dynamics, as argued by Phelps (1983). And decisionmakers' subjective perceptions of current conditions are assumed to be of imperfect precision, owing to finite information processing capacity, as argued by Sims (2001). The model can explain highly persistent real effects of a monetary disturbance, and a delayed effect on inflation, as found in VAR studies.

AB  - This paper quantitatively assesses distributional effects of monetary policy. We use a life cycle model with housing to compute the response of the U.S. household sector to an increase in the Federal Reserve’s inﬂation target. We ﬁnd than an increase in nominal interest rates generated by higher expected inﬂation has sizeable and heterogeneous welfare effects. Moreover, the responses of winners and losers do not cancel out; instead the policy announcement has persistent effects on aggregate consumption and house prices that propagate through the distribution of wealth.

AU  - Schmitt-Grohé, Stephanie

T2  - Journal of Monetary Economics
AB  - This paper analyzes the implications of a balanced-budget fiscal policy rule for price-level determination in a cash-in-advance economy under three alternative monetary policy regimes. It shows that the price level is indeterminate under a nominal interest rate peg and determinate under a money growth rate peg. Under a feedback rule that sets the nominal interest rate as a non-negative and non-decreasing function of the inflation rate, the price level is indeterminate for both low and high values of the inflation elasticity of the feedback rule and determinate for intermediate values. We also study balanced-budget rules that allow for bounded secondary surpluses or deficits. Comparing our results to those emphasized in the fiscal theory of the price level, it becomes clear that a key consideration for price-level determination is whether fiscal policy is specified as an exogenous sequence of primary surpluses/deficits or, alternatively, as an exogenous sequence of secondary surpluses/deficits.

TI  - Can Monetary Policy Affect the Real Economy?
AU  - Arestis, Philip
AU  - Sawyer, Malcolm C.
AB  - Current monetary policy involves the manipulation of the Central Bank interest rate (the repo rate), with the specific objective of achieving the goal(s) of monetary policy. The latter is normally the inflation rate, although in a number of instances this may include the level of economic activity (the U.S. Federal Reserve monetary policy is a good example of this category). This raises two issues. The first is the theoretical underpinnings of this mode of monetary policy. The second is the channels of monetary policy or, more concretely, the channels through which changes in the rate of interest may affect the ultimate goal(s) of policy. Both aspects are investigated in this paper. Furthermore, we suggest that it is imperative to consider the empirical estimates of the effects of monetary policy. We summarise results drawn from the eurozone, the U.S. and the UK and suggest that these empirical results point to a relatively weak effect of interest rate changes on inflation. We also suggest, on the basis of the evidence adduced in the paper, that monetary policy can have long-run effects on real magnitudes. This particular result does not fit comfortably with the theoretical basis of current thinking on monetary policy.

AB  - This paper explores issues in the relation of debt and monetary policy. Deficits are large, debts are rising absolutely and relative to GDP, unfunded liabilities greatly add to the explicit stock of debt. Debt (and deficits) play a special role at present, in the run up to Maastricht: the membership hurdle in terms of debts and deficits is hardly met by anyone. Debt is important in this context because large debts are seen as a threat to the integrity of the new European money or, at least, a serious complication and potential political pressure point in the exercise of sound monetary policy. But debt is also of interest in a less dramatic context from the simple question of what role it plays in the transmission mechanism of monetary policy.

AB  - Can higher inflation diminish the government debt and contribute to financing the budget deficit? And how do these public finance concerns influence inflationary expectations? These have been classic questions in macroeconomics since the seminal papers by Auemheimer (1974), Calvo (1978) and Barro (1983). The same questions recently became very relevant for several European countries in the aftermath of the 1992–3 Exchange Rate Mechanism crisis. In Sweden, our own country, the government deficit in 1994 stood at about 13 per cent of GDP.2 Increasing long bond rates and a depreciating kronor — as well as higher volatility in financial markets — were often explained by a fear that ‘politicians would lose control of government finances and resort to higher inflation as a solution.’ Developments in other countries with high debts and deficits, such as Italy or Spain, were similar.

AB  - In standard macroeconomics, fiscal policy consists of choices about expenditures, taxes, and debt issue. The kinds of public spending may be distinguished in terms of their interaction with private decisions; for example, some public activities would influence private production and some would interact with the choices of consumption and leisure. The taxes may also be differentiated by type — levies may fall on labour income, capital income, consumption, bodies and so on.

AB  - As government securities markets have grown during the last two decades, they have come to play an increasingly important role in both domestic monetary and fiscal policy and in the global capital markets. In many developed and developing nations, government securities have become the largest and most liquid segment of the debt market, and international participation in these markets has been increasing rapidly. The figures in Table 4.1 show the extent of the recent growth of government debt in both nominal dollars and relative to GDP. For the major industrial nations, for example, the ratio of government debt to GDP has risen from roughly 43 per cent in 1980 to approximately 68 per cent by the mid-1990s (IMF, 1994; p. 20).

AB  - Reduction of government deficits and controlling the rate of growth of the outstanding public debt has moved to the forefront among the economic policy challenges facing many of the leading industrial nations in recent years. This has come to be of particular concern among the members of the European Union, nearly all of whom must modify their present courses if they are to satisfy the requirements laid down in the Maastricht treaty for participation in the proposed European monetary union. An obvious question raised by the fiscal requirements of the Maastricht treaty — and a pressing one, given the difficulties that many aspiring members of such a union face in satisfying these requirements — is why controls over the degree to which governments resort to deficit finance should be essential to a successful monetary union.2

AB  - There is a large literature on why countries choose to issue debt rather than financing expenditures by current taxation. If Ricardian equivalence holds and taxes are non-distortionary, then it doesn’t matter whether government expenditures are financed by debt or taxes. When taxes are distortionary, debt can be used to smooth taxes and the associated distortions when the desired path of government expenditures is not smooth (Barro, 1979). In the absence of Ricardian equivalence, issuing debt rather than levying taxes may reflect short run stabilization considerations. The choice of whether to use taxes or debt may well also reflect concerns about the effects on private investment and capital accumulation, with debt possibly crowding out private capital accumulation, as in Diamond (1965). A government may also issue debt in order to influence or constrain the decisions of future governments (Lucas and Stokey, 1983; Persson and Svensson, 1989).2

AB  - There is a widespread view among financial market participants, policymakers and journalists that budget deficits and increasing government debt lead to a real depreciation of a country’s currency. This view seems to be based on the informal argument that the real exchange rate is a kind of indicator for a country’s expected future economic performance, which is supposed to be adversely affected by budget deficits and increasing debt. However, it is difficult to reconcile this argument with standard models of real exchange rate determination. First, let us briefly recall the results of the conventional macroeconomic textbook model.2 This framework unambiguously predicts that the real exchange rate appreciates in response to a permanent deficit financed increase in government expenditures. Besides the reduction of investment caused by rising interest rates, the corresponding appreciation of the real exchange rate reduces net exports in favour of increased government expenditure. Second, the conventional result is confirmed by equilibrium models of exchange rates pioneered by Lucas (1982). In this type of model the real exchange rate is the ratio of the foreign and domestic marginal utility of consumption. A permanent increase in government expenditure in the home country reduces home consumption and, therefore, increases marginal utility of home consumption, which in turn leads to a decrease in the real exchange rate.

AB  - In the debate on the European Monetary Union (EMU) one major issue is the fiscal rules of the Maastricht Treaty which impose ceilings on the government debt and deficits of the countries joining the EMU. There now exists a large body of literature on the potential benefits and costs of these debt rules: see, for example, Buiter et al. (1993) for a survey. One important question in this discussion is, of course, whether these debt rules are needed to prevent excessive inflation in a monetary union. While some contributions — for example Aizenman (1992), and van der Ploeg (1991) — support this view,2 other authors — for example Beetsma and Bovenberg (1995a,b) — have argued that these debt rules are unnecessary or may even be counterproductive in the sense that they will raise inflation in the union.

AB  - There is now a rapidly growing literature dealing with the relationship between fiscal and monetary policies in complete or incomplete monetary unions.2 Much of this literature is a reaction to the Delors Report and to the Maastricht Treaty. The Report suggested and the Treaty institutionalized binding fiscal rules for monetary convergence. Since then these rules have been intensively debated. Many authors regard them as superfluous or as arbitrarily fixed.

TI  - Monetary Policy during a Transition to Rational Expectations
AU  - Taylor, John B.
T2  - Journal of Political Economy
AB  - In standard macroeconomic models incorporating the natural rate hypothesis and rational expectations, monetary policy has no effect on real variables. But the rational expectations assumption that economic agents have learned from their mistaken predictions of the past ignores the transition period during which new information is combined with old information in the formation of new beliefs. The purpose of this paper is to examine the possible effects of monetary policy during this transition period. Using a simple momentary Phillips curve model and a particular characterization of monetary policy, it is shown that real variables (in this case unemployment) can be controlled. Further, an optimal monetary policy is computed by simple variational methods. This policy is a randomized rule which matches the marginal gain from future reductions in unemployment to the marginal loss of increased uncertainty about the price level. Unlike the rational expectations equilibrium, this rule will dominate purely deterministic rules, even if the latter are possible.

AB  - The pattern of trade in nominal assets is predicted, using the Law of Comparative Advantage and autarky asset price differences. It is examined how different combinations of monetary policies and exchange rate regimes affect nominal assets' real return risk characteristics, their autarky prices, and hence their trade pattern, when countries differ with respect to their outputs or their attitudes toward risk. With incomplete world asset markets, different monetary policies and exchange rate regimes have dramatic effects on risk characteristics, nominal assets, and their trade pattern, as well as on aggregate capital and current accounts.

AU  - Milani, Fabio

T2  - Journal of Money, Credit and Banking
AB  - There is substantial agreement in the monetary policy literature over the effects of exogenous monetary policy shocks. The shocks that are investigated, however, almost exclusively represent unanticipated changes in policy, which surprise the private sector and which are typically found to have a delayed and sluggish effect on output. In this paper, we estimate a New Keynesian model that incorporates news about future policies to try to disentangle the anticipated and unanticipated components of policy shocks. The paper shows that the conventional estimates confound two distinct effects on output: an effect due to unanticipated or “surprise” shocks, which is smaller and more short-lived than the response usually obtained in the literature, and a large, delayed, and persistent effect due to anticipated policy shocks or “news.” News shocks play a larger role in influencing the business cycle than unanticipated policy shocks, although the overall fraction of economic fluctuations that can be attributed to monetary policy remains limited.

This paper discusses some analytical and practical questions raised by MCIs. Furthermore, using data for Australia, Canada and New Zealand, which all operate monetary policy under floating rates and with an inflation target, it estimates the responses of the central banks to exchange rate changes. The results reveal clear differences between central banks: while the Reserve Bank of Australia does not appear to respond, the Bank of Canada and the Reserve Bank of New Zealand, who use the MCI as an operating target, do respond quite strongly to movements in the exchange rate.

AU  - Obstfeld, Maurice
AB  - This paper is a partial exploration of mechanisms through which global factors influence the tradeoffs that U.S. monetary policy faces. It considers three main channels. The first is the determination of domestic inflation in a context where international prices and global competition play a role, alongside domestic slack and inflation expectations. The second channel is the determination of asset returns (including the natural real safe rate of interest, r*) and financial conditions, given integration with global financial markets. The third channel, which is particular to the United States, is the potential spillback onto the U.S. economy from the disproportionate impact of U.S. monetary policy on the outside world. In themselves, global factors need not undermine a central bank's ability to control the price level over the long term – after all, it is the monopoly issuer of the numeraire in which domestic prices are measured. Over shorter horizons, however, global factors do change the tradeoff between price-level control and other goals such as low unemployment and financial stability, thereby affecting the policy cost of attaining a given price path.

AB  - This paper examines the impact of monetary policy on the economic development by using annual time series data from 1989-2016. The unit root testing result suggests that all variables are stationary at first difference; therefore, the Johansen Cointegration and Error Correction Model has been employed to analyze the association between variables. The finding shows that money supply, interest rate and inflation rate negatively effect on the real GDP per capita in the long run and only the real exchange rate has a positive sign. The error correction model result indicates the existence of short run causality between money supply, real exchange rate and real GDP per capita.

The implications of the model for the response of prices, interest rates, consumption, labor supply, and output to monetary policy are determined. As well, optimal monetary policy is studied, as are the costs of inflation. The model features persistent nonneutralities of money, relative price effects of increases in the money supply, persistent liquidity effects, and a negative Fisher effect from a money supply increase. A Friedman rule is in general suboptimal.

AB  - Estimated structural VARs show that external shocks are an important source of macroeconomic fluctuations in emerging markets. Furthermore, U.S. monetary policy shocks affect interest rates and the exchange rate in a typical emerging market quickly and strongly. The price level and real output in a typical emerging market respond to U.S. monetary policy shocks by more than the price level and real output in the U.S. itself. These findings are consistent with the idea that “when the U.S. sneezes, emerging markets catch a cold.” At the same time, U.S. monetary policy shocks are not important for emerging markets relative to other kinds of external shocks.

My approach has advantages over the standard practice of fitting a vector autoregression to the data. I apply my methodology to data on output, interest rates and prices. I find that, even using the Federal Reserve Board's Greenbook forecasts to control for the policy maker's information set, prices rise initially in response to a monetary contraction. This finding undermines the standard justification for including an index of commodity prices in VARs.

Our analysis emphasizes how the posture of monetary policy toward inflation influences the strategic calculations driving unions’ wage setting behavior in different institutional environments.

The monetary policy is measured by using the spread between the Central Bank's interbank interest rate and the depreciation rate of the domestic currency. A VAR type of model is used to identify monetary policy covering the period 1986:05-2000:10. The results suggest that tight monetary policy has a transitory effect on output but a permanent effect on prices. This specification is free of some puzzles such as the price puzzle and the liquidity puzzle that hampered some of the previous studies.

AB  - This paper presents evidence on the monetary transmission process in the euro area, based on macroeconomic data and on micro data on banks. According to the estimations of macro vector autoregression and macroeconometric models, a monetary policy tightening significantly reduces output and—after a time lag—also prices. The effect on output is temporary, while that on prices is permanent. Clear patterns of significant asymmetries in the monetary policy effects across countries do not emerge. The estimations based on micro data on banks show that the main factor that determines the average bank's response to monetary policy is its degree of liquidity: the lower its share of liquid assets in total assets, the more strongly does a bank reduce its lending in response to a monetary tightening. Bank size does not emerge as an important factor for a bank's reaction to monetary policy. These results hold for virtually all member countries of the European Monetary Union, despite the differences in their banking systems.

AB  - This paper argues that the stock market is an important channel of monetary policy. Monetary policy affects real economic activity because inflation levies a property tax on stocks in addition to an income tax on dividend payments. Inflation thus taxes stocks more heavily than it does bonds. Households alter their required rate of return as inflation changes, and firms adjust production in order to satisfy their shareholders’ demands. As the stock market channel grows in importance, the appropriate intermediate target for the central bank is the price level, with price stability being the ultimate goal.

AB  - Leading economists discuss post–financial crisis policy dilemmas, including the dangers of complacency in a period of relative stability.The Great Depression led to the Keynesian revolution and dramatic shifts in macroeconomic theory and macroeconomic policy. Similarly, the stagflation of the 1970s led to the adoption of the natural rate hypothesis and to a major reassessment of the role of macroeconomic policy. Should the financial crisis and the Great Recession lead to yet another major reassessment, to another intellectual revolution?  Will it?  If so, what form should it, or will it, take? These are the questions taken up in this book, in a series of contributions by policymakers and academics. The contributors discuss the complex role of the financial sector, the relative roles of monetary and fiscal policy, the limits of monetary policy to address financial stability, the need for fiscal policy to play a more active role in stabilization, and the relative roles of financial regulation and macroprudential tools. The general message is a warning against going back to precrisis ways—to narrow inflation targeting, little use of fiscal policy for stabilization, and insufficient financial regulation.ContributorsDavid Aikman, Alan J.

AB  - A model is developed that employs recent developments in the literature on search models of money to capture the distributional effects of monetary policy in a tractable way. Deterministic and stochastic versions of the model are studied. Money is not neutral, and these nonneutralities persist, whether or not the change in the money supply is anticipated or unanticipated. At the optimum, monetary policy is geared to correcting distortions in the search sector of the economy, while correcting for the persistent effects of past monetary policy actions.
