AU  - MISHKIN, FREDERIC S.
T2  - Monetary Policy Over Fifty Years
AB  - Over the past three decades, we have seen a remarkable change in the performance of monetary policy. By the end of the 1970s, inflation had risen to very high
levels, with many countries in the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and
Development (OECD) experiencing double-digit inflation rates (Figure 3.1). Most
OECD countries today have inflation rates at around the 2 per cent level, which is
consistent with what most economists see as price stability, and the volatility of
inflation has also fallen dramatically (Figure 3.2). One concern might be that the
low and stable levels of inflation might have been achieved at the expense of higher
volatility in output, but that is not what has occurred. Output volatility has also
declined in most OECD countries (Figure 3.3). The improved performance of
monetary policy has been associated with advances in the science of monetary
policy; that is, a set of principles that have been developed from rigorous theory
and empirical work that have come to guide the thinking of monetary policy
practitioners.

AB  - We show that makeup strategies, such as average inflation targeting and price-level targeting, can be more effective than a flexible inflation targeting strategy in overcoming the obstacles created by the effective lower bound in a heterogeneous agent New Keynesian (HANK) model. We also show that the macroeconomic stabilization benefits from such alternative strategies can be substantially larger in a HANK environment than in a representative agent New Keynesian model. We argue that gains in employment outcomes from switching to an alternative strategy would generate disproportionate improvements for historically disadvantaged households and thus have potentially long-lasting effects on the economic well-being of these groups.

TI  - A VAR Description of the Effects of Monetary Policy in the Individual Countries of the Euro Area
AU  - Mojon, Benoit
AU  - Peersman, Gert
AB  - This paper presents a complete set of results describing the effects of monetary policy in 10 countries of the Euro area for the pre-EMU period. For each country, we impose one of three identification schemes depending on its monetary integration with Germany, the nominal anchor of the ERM. The first identification scheme applies to Germany, the second to countries of the core EMS (Austria, Belgium and the Netherlands) and the third to all the other countries. An unexpected rise in the short-term interest rate leads to a decrease in GDP, (with investment and exports falling more than consumption) and a gradual decrease in prices for all countries. We also show that, given the width of the error bands around the estimate, we cannot reject that the effects of monetary policy on GDP and on prices are broadly similar in the individual countries of the Euro area.

TI  - The Credit Effects of Monetary Policy: Evidence Using Loan Commitments
AU  - Morgan, Donald P.
T2  - Journal of Money, Credit and Banking
AB  - In addition to the usual channels, monetary policy may affect spending by changing the supply of bank loans and the creditworthiness of borrowers. This paper tests for these credit effects using a contractual difference across commercial bank loans. I find that bank loans not made under a commitment slow after tight policy, while loans under commitment accelerate or are unchanged. This divergence coincides with reports of tighter credit by lenders and by small firms, suggesting the divergence reflects a reduction in the supply of credit to the firms without commitments, rather than a reduction in their demand for loans.

AU  - McCallum, Bennett T.

AB  - This paper asks whether relations of the IS-LM type can sensibly be used for the aggregate demand portion of a dynamic optimizing general equilibrium model intended for analysis of issues regarding monetary policy and cyclical fluctuations. The main result is that only one change – the addition of a term regarding expected future income – is needed to make the IS function match a fully optimizing model, whereas no changes are needed for the LM function. This modification imparts a dynamic, forward-looking aspect to saving behavior and leads to a model of aggregate demand that is tractable and usable with a wide variety of aggregate supply specifications. Theoretical applications concerning price level determinacy and inflation persistence are included.

AB  - This paper focuses on the interaction of monetary policy and wage formation in economies with strong labor unions. Government and unions are viewed as endogenous utility maximizers and the macroeconomic consequences of their strategic interaction are explored with the aid of some elements of simple game theory. Specifically, it is shown (a) how labor unions adjust wages to prices so as to maximize their utility following changes in monetary policy; (b) how the effectiveness of monetary policy is circumscribed without necessarily being nullified by the utility-maximizing reactions of unions; and (c) how the interplay of government and unions can create a persistent tendency towards inflation and unemployment simultaneously.

Results show that tight monetary policy lowers prices and increase demand for domestic agriculture; however, the upward pressure on the exchange rate seriously deteriorates the position of U.S. exports in international markets.

AU  - Agbonlahor, Osasohan
AB  - The paper investigates empirically the impact of monetary policy on economic growth in the United Kingdom. The study uses time-series data over a study period spanning from 1940-2012. The impacts of each of the endogenous variables are investigated using the Vector Error Correction Model (VECM). The study shows that a long run relationship exists among the monetary variables. Specifically, it finds that the inflationary rate and money supply are significant monetary policy instruments that drive growth in the United Kingdom. It therefore recommends that the UK policy makers focus on boosting macroeconomic performance by ensuring that growth in money supply is proportional to the growth in real Gross Domestic Product.

AU  - Vrolijk, Coenraad
AB  - This paper examines changes in the monetary policy transmission mechanism in the presence of derivatives markets. The effect of adding derivatives markets is analyzed independently for each of the main channels of monetary policy transmission: interest rates, credit, and exchange rates. Theoretically, derivatives trading speeds up transmission to financial asset prices, but changes in the transmission to the real economy are ambiguous. Using the structural vector autoregression methodology, an empirical study of the United Kingdom is used to assess the impulse responses of output and inflation, controlling for the size of the U.K. derivative markets. No definitive empirical support for a change in the transmission process is found.

AB  - Nigeria has over the years been controlling her economy through various macroeconomic policies of which monetary policy is among using some monetary policy instruments in efforts to drive along the desired path. This study empirically reassessed the impact of monetary policy on economic growth of Nigeria adopting the Error Correction Model approach. It utilized time series secondary data spanning between 1982 and 2013. The result showed that a unit increase in Cash Reserve Ratio (CRR) led to approximately seven units increase in economic growth in Nigeria. The result was in consonance with economic literature as monetary policy among other objectives is geared towards achieving the macroeconomic objectives of sustained economic growth and price stability. Therefore, the study recommends that monetary authorities should give priority attention to CRR monetary policy tool as it will produce a more desired result in terms of economic stabilization. And also some combination of fiscal policy measures are needed to attain the complementary balance required to drive an economy towards to desired goals.

AB  - Monetary policy plays a key role in determining interest rates, prices, inflation, exchange rates, and economic growth. The higher and more volatile inflation and interest rates of the past two decades, coupled with lower real growth, have spurred attention toward new instruments for formulating and implementing monetary policy. Primary commodity prices, which are sensitive to changes in inflationary pressures, have been suggested as possible operating targets or information variables for monetary policy. According to our research, nonagricultural commodity prices may carry useful information for assessing monetary policy effects on the general price level. But empirical relationships and constraints from agricultural policy suggest a limited role for agricultural commodity prices in monetary policy. This report presents empirical evidence on the relationships among agricultural and nonagricultural commodity prices, the general price level, monetary aggregates, interest rates, industrial production, and the exchange rate.

TI  - Financial Stability and Monetary Policy: How Closely Interlinked?
AU  - Smets, Frank
T2  - International Journal of Central Banking
AB  - The recent financial crisis has again raised the question
to what extent price-stability-oriented monetary policy frameworks should take into account financial stability objectives.
In this paper I argue that the answer will depend on three
questions: (i) how effective is macroprudential policy in maintaining financial stability? (ii) what is the effect of monetary
policy on risk taking and financial stability? and (iii) what is
the risk of financial dominance, i.e., the risk that financial stability considerations undermine the credibility of the central
bank’s price stability mandate? I review the theory and evidence and conclude that while the new macroprudential policy
framework should be the main tool for maintaining financial
stability, monetary policy authorities should also keep an eye
on financial stability. This will allow the central bank to lean
against the wind if necessary, while maintaining its primary
focus on price stability over the medium term.

Journal of Monetary Economics 34, 75–88] adopted a narrative approach to address the identification problems in time series models of monetary policy. Based on Federal Reserve documents, the Romers created a dummy variable equal to one in periods when the Federal Reserve contracted in response to perceived inflationary pressures. This paper shows: (1) the dummy variable is predictable from past macroeconomic variables, reflecting the endogenous response of policy to the economy; (2) unpredictable changes in the dummy do not generate dynamic responses that look like the effects of monetary policy. The identification problems that plague time series models also afflict the narrative approach.

We find significant regional effect of monetary policy on housing markets. Interest rate effects dominate the influence of local price innovations in the core economic regions in Sweden. We further discuss the monetary transmission channels and highlight political implications.

T2  - Journal of Macroeconomics
AB  - Since the late 1980s the Fed has implemented monetary policy by adjusting its target for the overnight federal funds rate. Money’s role in monetary policy has been tertiary, at best. Indeed, several influential economists suggest that money is irrelevant for monetary policy because central banks affect economic activity and inflation by (i) controlling a very short-term nominal interest rate and (ii) influencing financial market participants’ expectation of the future policy rate. I offer an alternative perspective: Money is essential for monetary policy because it is essential for controlling the price level, and the monetary authority’s ability to control interest rates is greatly exaggerated.

AB  - We analyze a sticky price model where a ﬁrm chooses a price plan, namely a set of 2 prices. Changing the plan entails a “menu cost”, but either price in the plan can be charged at any point in time. We analytically solve for the optimal policy and for the output response to a monetary shock. The setup generates a persistent reference price level and short lived deviations from it, as well as a decreasing hazard function for price changes, consistent with some datasets. We show that the temporary price changes substantially increase the ﬂexibility of the aggregate price level.

TI  - Sales and the Real Effects of Monetary Policy
AU  - Kehoe, Patrick J.
AU  - Midrigan, Virgiliu
AB  - In the data, a sizable fraction of price changes are temporary price reductions referred to as sales. Existing models include no role for sales. Hence, when confronted with data in which a large fraction of price changes are sales related, the models must either exclude sales from the data or leave them in and implicitly treat sales like any other price change. When sales are included, prices change frequently and standard sticky price models with this high frequency of price changes predict small eﬀects from money shocks. If sales are excluded, prices change much less frequently and a standard sticky price model with this low frequency of price changes predict much larger eﬀects of money shocks. This paper adds a motive for sales in a parsimonious extension of existing sticky price models. We show that the model can account for most of the patterns of sales in the data. Using our model as the data generating process, we evaluate the existing approaches and ﬁnd that neither well approximates the real eﬀects of money in our economy in which sales are explicitly modeled.

AU  - Orajaka, Ugochukwu Paul
AB  - Monetary policy is one of the regulatory measures of the government to checkmate the money supply in the economy in order to achieve the desired level of prices, employment, output, and boost the industrial sector growth. Industrialization has always constituted a major focus of development strategy and government policy. One of the engines of industrialization is enhancing manufacturing sector capacity; this study adopted manufacturing sector output to examine the effect of monetary policy on industrial growth in Nigeria between 1986 and 2019. Data for the study were collected from the CBN Statistical bulletin, 2019 edition. A multiple regression model was developed and the Ordinary Least Square (OLS) regression technique employed for data analysis. The results showed that Open Market Operation (OMO) measured by Treasury bill rate had positive and significant effect on the Nigerian Manufacturing Domestic Sector Gross Product; Cash Reserve Ratio (CRR) has a positive and significant effect on the Nigerian Manufacturing Sector Gross Domestic Product; and Monetary Policy Rate (MPR) has a negative and significant effect on the Nigerian Manufacturing Sector Gross Domestic Product. The study concludes that monetary policy is a veritable tool for enhancing industrial sector growth in Nigeria. It was recommended that the monetary authority should ensure a lower MPR that can drive up investment and thus boost growth of the industry.

TI  - Commodity Price Responses to Monetary Policy Surprises
AU  - Scrimgeour, Dean
T2  - American Journal of Agricultural Economics
AB  - Information contained in high-frequency financial market data reveals that a 10 basis-point surprise increase in interest rates causes commodity prices to fall immediately by approximately 0.6%. This is similar to the estimated responses of both the Standard and Poor's 500 and a United States trade weighted exchange rate index, and approximately five times larger than the response in a standard vector autoregression, even twelve months after the shock. Metals prices tend to respond more than agricultural commodities. The point estimate for oil prices is similar to other commodities, but is estimated less precisely.

TI  - Monetary Policy Frameworks and the Effective Lower Bound on Interest Rates
AU  - Mertens, Thomas M.
AU  - Williams, John C.
T2  - AEA Papers and Proceedings
AB  - This paper applies a New Keynesian model to analyze monetary policy in the presence of a low natural rate of interest and a lower bound on interest rates. Under standard inflation-targeting, inflation expectations will be anchored at a level below the inflation target. Two themes emerge from our analysis: first, the central bank can mitigate this problem of a downward bias in inflation expectations by following an average-inflation targeting framework. Second, price-level targeting that raises inflation expectations when inflation is low can both anchor expectations at target and further reduce the effects of the lower bound on the economy.

TI  - The Effectiveness of Monetary Policy Reconsidered
AU  - Weeks, John
AB  - This paper inspects the standard policy rule that under a flexible exchange rate regime with perfectly elastic capital flows, monetary policy is effective and fiscal policy is not. The logical validity of the statement requires that the effect of an exchange rate change on the domestic price level be ignored. The price level effect is noted in some textbooks, but not formally analyzed. When it is subjected to a rigorous analysis, the interaction between changes in the exchange rate and the domestic price level significantly alters the standard policy rule. The logically correct statement would be, under a flexible exchange rate regime with perfectly elastic capital flows the effectiveness of monetary policy depends on the values of the import share and the sum of the trade elasticities. Inspection of data from developing countries indicates the effectiveness of monetary policy under flexible exchange rates can be quite low even if capital flows are perfectly elastic.

TI  - Progress and Confusion: The State of Macroeconomic Policy

AU  - Summers, Lawrence H.
AB  - Leading economists consider the shape of future economic policy: will it resume the pre-crisis consensus, or contend with the post-crisis “new normal”? What will economic policy look like once the global financial crisis is finally over? Will it resume the pre-crisis consensus, or will it be forced to contend with a post-crisis “new normal”? Have we made progress in addressing these issues, or does confusion remain? In April of 2015, the International Monetary Fund gathered leading economists, both academics and policymakers, to address the shape of future macroeconomic policy. This book is the result, with prominent figures—including Ben Bernanke, John Taylor, and Paul Volcker—offering essays that address topics that range from the measurement of systemic risk to foreign exchange intervention.The chapters address whether we have entered a “new normal” of low growth, negative real rates, and deflationary pressures, with contributors taking opposing views; whether new financial regulation has stemmed systemic risk; the effectiveness of macro prudential tools; monetary policy, the choice of inflation targets, and the responsibilities of central banks; fiscal policy, stimulus, and debt stabilization; the volatility of capital flows; and the international monetary and financial system, including the role of international policy coordination.In light of these discussions, is there progress or confusion regarding the future of macroeconomic policy? In the final chapter, volume editor Olivier Blanchard answers: both. Many lessons have been learned; but, as the chapters of the book reveal, there is no clear agreement on several key issues.ContributorsViral V. Acharya, Anat R.

TI  - Monetary Policy and the Redistribution Channel
AU  - Auclert, Adrien
T2  - American Economic Review
AB  - This paper evaluates the role of redistribution in the transmission mechanism of monetary policy to consumption. Three channels affect aggregate spending when winners and losers have different marginal propensities to consume: an earnings heterogeneity channel from unequal income gains, a Fisher channel from unexpected inflation, and an interest rate exposure channel from real interest rate changes. Sufficient statistics from Italian and US data suggest that all three channels are likely to amplify the effects of monetary policy.

AU  - McCallum, Bennett T.
T2  - Handbook of Macroeconomics
AB  - This chapter begins with a number of important preliminary issues including the distinction between rules and discretion in monetary policy; the feasibility of committed rule-like behavior by an independent central bank; and optimal control vs. robustness strategies for conducting research. It then takes up the choice among alternative target variables — with the most prominent contenders including price level, nominal income, and hybrid (inflation plus output gap) variables — together with the issue of growth-rate vs. growing-level target path specifications. One conclusion is that inflation and nominal income growth targets, but not the hybrid target, would have induced fairly similar policy responses in the US economy over 1960–1995. With regard to instrument choice, the chapter argues that both nominal interest rate and monetary base measures are feasible; this discussion emphasizes the basic conceptual distinction between nominal indeterminacy and solution multiplicity. Accordingly, root-mean-square-error performance measures are estimated for interest rate and base instruments (with nominal income target) in the context of a VAR model. Other topics emphasized in the chapter include the operationality of policy-rule specifications; stochastic vs. historical simulation procedures; interactions between monetary and fiscal policies; and the recently-developed fiscal theory of the price level.

TI  - Asymmetric Effect of Monetary Policy Shocks on Output and Prices in Nigeria

T2  - African Journal of Economic Review
AB  - This study investigated the asymmetric effect of positive and negative monetary policy shocks on output and prices in Nigeria using interest rate shocks. This was with the view to ascertaining the impact of monetary policy on sustainable output growth and price stability in Nigeria from 1986 to 2016. Quarterly secondary data from 1986: Q1 to 2016:Q4 on output (GDP), interest rate, money supply, inflation rate, investment and real effective exchange rate were sourced from Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) Statistical Bulletin, 2016 and World Development Indicator (WDI), 2018. Data collected were analyzed using Non-linear Autoregressive Distributive Lag (NARDL) econometric techniques. The results showed that in the short run, negative shocks have more significant effects (2.7%) on output than positive shocks (1.2%) but the effects of positive and negative monetary policy shocks do not have significant effects on price level; while in the long run, positive shocks have more significant effects than the negative shocks on both output (3.1% and 1.9%) and prices (-51.1%and 45.1%). The study concluded that monetary policy shocks have asymmetric effects on output and prices in Nigeria both in the short and long run period. Keywords:  Asymmetric, Policy Shocks, Positive, Negative, Output, Prices

AB  - We argue that the time-varying regional distribution of housing equity influences the aggregate consequences of monetary policy through its effects on mortgage refinancing. Using detailed loan-level data, we show that regional differences in housing equity affect refinancing and spending responses to interest rate cuts but that these effects vary over time with changes in the regional distribution of house price growth. We then build a heterogeneous household model of refinancing with both mortgage borrowers and lenders and use it to explore the aggregate implications for monetary policy arising from our regional evidence. We find that the 2008 equity distribution made spending in depressed regions less responsive to interest rate cuts, thus dampening aggregate stimulus and increasing regional consumption inequality, whereas the opposite occurred in some earlier recessions. Taken together, our results strongly suggest that monetary policy makers should track the regional distribution of equity over time.

TI  - Monetary Policy Under Neoclassical and New-Keynesian Phillips Curves, with an Application to Price Level and Inflation Targeting
AU  - Kiley, Michael T.
AB  - This paper compares discretionary monetary policy under two Phillips curves. Previous work uses a Phillips curve consistent with "Neoclassical" models of price adjustment. Sticky price models imply a "New-Keynesian" Phillips curve based on staggered price setting that delivers familiar results on an inflationary bias and inflation contracts. However, the comparison of price level and inflation targeting reveals an output/price stability tradeoff under the New-Keynesian model that does not arise under the Neoclassical specification, illustrating the usefulness of considering the New-Keynesian model. Given the empirical support for the New-Keynesian specification, a stability tradeoff likely exists.

TI  - Monetary Policy and Japan’s Liquidity Trap
AU  - Svensson, Lars E O
AB  - During the long economic slump in Japan, monetary policy in Japan has essentially consisted of a very low interest rate (since 1995), a zero interest rate (since 1999), and quantitative easing (since 2001). The intention seems to have been to lower expectations of future interest rates. But the problem in a liquidity trap (when the zero lower bound on the central bank’s instrument rate is strictly binding) is rather to raise private-sector expectations of the future price level. Increased expectations of a higher future price level are likely to be much more eﬀective in reducing the real interest rate and stimulating the economy out of a liquidity trap than a further reduction of already very low expectations of future interest rates. Therefore, monetarypolicy alternatives in a liquidity trap should be assessed according to how eﬀective they are likely to be in aﬀecting private-sector expectations of the future price level. Expectations of a higher future price level would lead to current depreciation of the currency. Quantitative easing would induce expectations of a higher price level if it were expected to be permanent. The absence of a depreciation of the yen and other evidence indicates that the quantitative easing is not expected to be permanent. In an open economy, the Foolproof Way (consisting of a price-level target path, currency depreciation and commitment to a currency peg and a zero interest rate until the price-level target path has been reached) is likely to be the most eﬀective policy to raise expectations of the future price level, stimulate the economy, and escape from a liquidity trap. It is the ﬁrst-best policy to end stagnation and deﬂation in Japan. The Foolproof Way without the explicit exchange-rate policy, namely a price-level target path and a commitment to a zero interest rate until the price-level target path has been reached, would be a second-best policy. The current policy, a commitment to a zero interest rate until inﬂation has become nonnegative is at best a third-best policy, since it accommodates all deﬂation that has occurred before inﬂation turns nonnegative and therefore is not eﬀective in inducing inﬂation expectations.

This model provides an econometric specification for testing for a causal relationship between money and the relative prices of agricultural commodities. Test results indicate that variations in the growth rate of the nominal money supply (whether anticipated or unanticipated) have not been an important influence on the average level of prices received by farmers relative to other prices in the economy over the period 1951–85.

TI  - Optimal Monetary Policy in a Liquidity Trap
AU  - Eggertsson, Gauti B.
AU  - Woodford, Michael
AB  - We consider the consequences for monetary policy of the zero floor for nominal interest rates. The zero bound can be a significant constraint on the ability of a central bank to combat deflation. We show, in the context of an intertemporal equilibrium model, that open-market operations, even of unconventional' types, are ineffective if they do not change expectations about the future conduct of policy; in this sense, a liquidity trap' is possible. Nonetheless, a credible commitment to the right sort of history-dependent policy can largely mitigate the distortions created by the zero bound. In our model, optimal policy involves a commitment to adjust interest rates so as to achieve a time-varying price-level target, when this is consistent with the zero bound. We also discuss ways in which other central-bank actions, while irrelevant apart from their effects on expectations, may help to make credible a central bank's commitment to its target, and consider implications for the policy options currently available for overcoming deflation in Japan.

AB  - This paper assesses the macroeconomic effects of unconventional monetary policies by estimating a panel vector autoregression (VAR) with monthly data from eight advanced economies over a sample spanning the period since the onset of the global financial crisis. It finds that an exogenous increase in central bank balance sheets at the zero lower bound leads to a temporary rise in economic activity and consumer prices. The estimated output effects turn out to be qualitatively similar to the ones found in the literature on the effects of conventional monetary policy, while the impact on the price level is weaker and less persistent. Individual country results suggest that there are no major differences in the macroeconomic effects of unconventional monetary policies across countries, despite the heterogeneity of the measures that were taken.

AB  - The major objective of this study is to empirically analyze the impact of monetary policy on the economy of Nigeria. To achieve this major objective, the study made use of broad money supply (M2) and credit to the private sector (CPS) as the independent variables explaining the dependent variable which is the Gross Domestic Product (GDP). The time series data employed cover the period of 1996 to 2016 and have been collected from the Central Bank of Nigeria Statistical Bulletin. The statistical tool used in this study is the multi regression and student t-test with the aid of statistical package for social sciences (SPSS) to analyze the impact of the individual explanatory variables on the economy. The result indicates that the monetary policy in Nigeria does not have significant impact on the economy. At 5% level of significance, the broad money supply (M2) is 0.36 > 0.05 while the CPS shows 0.22 > 0.05. The result proves that the broad money supply has not been properly regulated and the bank lending rate to the private sectors so high that the economy has been adversely affected. The study therefore, recommends that the Central Bank of Nigeria should put every machinery in place to ensure that the monetary policy is geared towards economic growth through substantial reduction of bank lending rate to the private sector and proper regulation of broad money supply.

TI  - The future of monetary aggregates in monetary policy analysis
AU  - Nelson, Edward
T2  - Journal of Monetary Economics
AB  - This paper considers the role of monetary aggregates in modern macroeconomic models of the New Keynesian type. The focus is on future model developments that are suggested by the monetarist literature, and that in addition seem justified empirically. Both the relation between money and inflation, and between money and aggregate demand, are considered. Regarding the first relation, it is argued that both the mean and the dynamics of inflation in present-day models are governed by money growth. This arises from a conventional aggregate-demand channel; claims that an emphasis on the link between monetary aggregates and inflation requires a direct channel connecting money to inflation, are wide of the mark. The relevance of money for aggregate demand, in turn, comes not via real balance effects (or other justifications for money in the IS equation), but on money serving as a proxy for the various substitution effects of monetary policy that exist when many asset prices matter for aggregate demand. This role for monetary aggregates is supported by empirical evidence and enhances the value of money to monetary policy.

TI  - Estimating the effect of Hungarian monetary policy within a structural VAR framework
AU  - Vonnák, Balázs
AB  - A standard approach in measuring the effect of monetary policy on output and prices is to estimate a VAR model, characterise somehow the monetary policy shock and then plot impulse responses. In this paper I attempt to do this exercise with Hungarian data. I compare two identification approaches. One of them involves the ‘sign restrictions on impulse responses’ strategy applied recently by several authors. I also propose another approach, namely, imposing restrictions on implied shock history. My argument is that in certain cases, especially in the case of the Hungarian economy, the latter identification scheme may be more credible. In order to obtain robust results I use two datasets. To tackle possible structural breaks I make alternative estimates on a shorter sample as well. The main conclusions are the followings: (1) although the two identification approaches produced very similar results, imposing restrictions on history may help to dampen counterintuitive reaction of prices; (2) after 1995 a typical unanticipated monetary policy contraction (a roughly 25 basis points rate hike) resulted in an immediate 1 per cent appreciation of the nominal exchange rate (3) followed by a 0.3% lower output and 0.1-0.15% lower consumer prices; (4) the impact on prices is slower than on output; it reaches its bottom 4-6 years after the shock, resembling the intuitive choreography of sticky-price models; (5) using additional observations prior to 1995 makes identification more difficult indicating the presence of a marked structural break.

TI  - The case for price level or inflation targeting—What happened to monetary policy effectiveness during the Japanese disinflation?
AU  - Mehrotra, Aaron
T2  - Japan and the World Economy
AB  - This paper examines whether price level or inflation targeting would have been appropriate policy choices for Japan during its disinflation and deflation period. We employ Markov switching and structural vector autoregressions, together with structural IS equations, to investigate monetary policy effectiveness during the Japanese disinflation. We find evidence of regime switching in the mid-1990s in a model including the nominal policy interest rate. When monetary policy shocks are identified by using the McCallum rule for monetary base, a monetary expansion is found to have a statistically significant impact on prices. Moreover, a lower real ex ante interest rate can still stimulate the economy despite the zero lower bound on nominal interest rates.

T2  - Journal of the Japanese and International Economies
AB  - Using dynamic programming methods, we study the design of optimal monetary policy in a simple, calibrated open-economy model and evaluate the effect of the liquidity trap generated by the zero bound on nominal interest rates. We show that the optimal policy near price stability is asymmetric. As inflation declines, policy turns expansionary sooner and more aggressively than would be optimal in the absence of the zero bound. This introduces an upward bias in the average level of inflation. We also discuss operational issues associated with the interpretation and implementation of policy at the zero bound in relation to the recent situation in Japan. J. Japan. Int.

A2  - David, PAUL A.
A2  - Reder, MELVIN W.
AB  - This chapter discusses monetary policy in developing countries. From the long-run point of view, the problem of desirable monetary policy reduces primarily to the desirable rate and form of inflation. Two intermediate steps lead to this identification: the recognition that monetary policy is concerned primarily with the quantity of money, not with the terms and availability of credit, and that inflation is always and everywhere a result of a rapid rate of increase in the quantity of money. The chapter discusses these two intermediate steps before turning to the relation between inflation and development. The best way to foster an effective and diversified financial structure is to let financial institutions develop in response to market forces. Repressing prices of goods and of labor, while no less frequently attempted than repression of exchange rate and interest rates, generally does less economic harm. The reason is that they tend to be easier to evade. However, they do great social harm. Given price controls, black markets serve a socially useful purpose by preventing the distortions that would otherwise develop. The effect of price controls is, therefore, to make socially and individually beneficial action that is morally repugnant because it involves breaking the law. The conflict tends to undermine the moral capital of a nation. Good monetary policy cannot produce development. Economic development fundamentally depends on much more basic forces: the amount of capital, the methods of economic organization, the skills of people, the available knowledge, the willingness to work and to save, and the receptivity of the members of the community to change.

T2  - Journal of Macroeconomics
AB  - This paper proposes a measure to assess the monetary policy for a highly inflationary small open economy: Turkey. The empirical evidence suggests that positive innovations in the spread between the Central Bank’s interbank interest rate and the depreciation rate of the local currency mimic the properties of the tight monetary policy. These innovations, when they are positive, decrease income and prices, and appreciate the local currency. For prices and the exchange rate, the effects are permanent; but for income the effect is transitory.

AB  - This paper characterizes conditions under which interest-rate feedback rules that set the nominal interest rate as an increasing function of the inflation rate induce aggregate instability by generating multiple equilibria. It shows that these conditions depend not only on the monetary-fiscal regime (as emphasized in the fiscal theory of the price level) but also on the way in which money is assumed to enter preferences and technology. It provides a number of examples in which, contrary to what is commonly believed, active monetary policy gives rise to multiple equilibria and passive monetary policy renders the equilibrium unique.

AB  - What are the goals of monetary policy and how are they transmitted?  Top scholars summarize recent evidence on the roles of money in the economy, the effects of information, and the growing importance of nonbank financial institutions. Their investigations lead to questions about standard presumptions about the rationality of asset markets and renewed interest in fiscal-monetary connections. Stopping short of advocating conclusions about the ideal conduct of policy, the authors focus instead on analytical methods and the changing interactions among the ingredients and properties that inform monetary models. The influences between economic performance and monetary policy regimes can be both grand and muted, and this volume clarifies the present state of this continually evolving relationship.  Presents extensive coverage of monetary policy theories with an eye toward questions raised by the recent financial crisis  Explores the ingredients, properties, and implications of models that inform monetary policy  Observes changes in the formulation of monetary policies over the last 25 years

AB  - The study analyzed the impact of monetary policy shocks on economic growth in 12 countries of the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS), using quarterly data from 1980(1) to 2017(4). We employed a Panel Structural Vector Autoregressive (Panel SVAR) for the modeling of monetary policy transmission shock in the segregated sub-regions of WAMZ and WAEMU. The key results suggest that fluctuations of the monetary policy do not have significant effects on the economic growth but significantly impact the general price level. Moreover, the study finds that the exchange rate is persistently a vital mechanism that significantly influences the variables of the real economy. Our estimates further suggest that there is idiosyncratic evidence found in the results, which is the anomaly of the Price puzzle.

TI  - Targets, Indicators, and Instruments of Monetary Policy
AU  - McCallum, Bennett T.
AB  - It has become increasingly evident that the Federal Reserve's official strategy of the past decade, involving the adherence to target paths for monetary aggregates, is not currently being utilized to any significant extent. While some commentators welcome and others deplore this development, most would agree that a need exists for a more explicit and coherent strategy for the conduct of monetary policy. The present paper seeks to advance the strategic discussion in several ways. One involves a comparative consideration of targets for nominal GNP and the price level, with emphasis on specificational robustness and implications for output variability. A second pertains to various "indicator" variables recently suggested by Fed officials and others. In this regard, it is necessary to be clear and specific about the role of potential indicators. Consequently, a careful review of the relevant conceptual distinctions–concerning instruments, targets, indicators, etc.–is reqUired. Finally, the proposal that strategy should be conducted so as to place minimal reliance on quantity variables is given some attention, in the context of evidence concerning the merits of an interest rate instrument.

AB  - Changes in the field of central banking over the past two decades have been nothing short of dramatic. They include the importance of central bank autonomy, the desirability of low and stable inflation, and the vital role played by how central banks communicate their views and intentions to the markets and the public more generally. There remains considerable diversity nevertheless in the institutional framework affecting central banks, the manner in which the stance of monetary policy is determined and assessed, and the forces that dictate the conduct of monetary policy more generally. The global financial crisis, which began in the United States in 2007, only serves to highlight further the importance of central bank policies. The aim of this volume is to take stock of where we are in the realm of the practice of central banking and considers some of the implications arising from the ongoing crisis.

TI  - Transparency and Monetary Policy with Imperfect Common Knowledge
AU  - Roca, Mr Mauro
AB  - Is it desirable that central banks be more transparent in the communication of sensible information when agents have diverse private information? In practice, there exists some consensus about the benefits of acting in this way. However, other studies warn that increasing the precision of public information may raise the volatility of some aggregate variables - in particular, the price level - due to the disproportionate influence that it exerts on agents' decisions, and that this, in turn, will have negative effects on welfare. This paper studies the welfare effects of varying levels of transparency in a model of price-setting under monopolistic competition and imperfect common knowledge. Our results indicate that more precise public information never leads to a reduction of welfare in this framework. We find that the beneficial effects of decreased imperfect common knowledge due to a more precise common signal always compensates the potential rise in aggregate volatility. Moreover, we show that, in contrast to what has previously been assumed, the variability of the aggregate price level has no detrimental welfare effects in this model.

T2  - Journal of Economic Surveys
AB  - This paper focuses on the price stability objective within the framework of the single monetary policy strategy. It starts by reviewing what this objective, which is common to all central banks, means. Second, this paper focuses exclusively on the anchoring of short- to medium-term inflation expectations (Part 2). Several measures show that this anchoring is effective. A ‘two-pillar’ small structural macro-economic model framework is used to analyze the impact that this anchoring of expectations has on the determination of the short- to medium-term inflation rate. From this point of view, observed inflation in the euro area seems to be in line with the theory and the ECB's action seems to be very effective. Third, we focus on the other aspect of monetary stability: the degree of price-level uncertainty and the anchoring of inflation expectations in the medium to long term. Even though this assessment is more difficult than it is in the short to medium term, since we only have a track record covering 6 years, various indicators from the theoretical analysis paint a fairly reassuring picture of the effectiveness of the device used by the ECB.

TI  - Monetary Policy and Heterogeneity: An Analytical Framework
AU  - Bilbiie, Florin Ovidiu
AB  - THANK is a tractable heterogeneous-agent New-Keynesian model that captures analytically key micro-heterogeneity channels of quantitative-HANK: cyclical inequality and risk as separate but related channels; idiosyncratic uncertainty and self-insurance, precautionary saving; and realistic intertemporal marginal propensities to consume. I use it for a full-fledged New Keynesian macro analysis: determinacy with interest-rate rules, solving the forward-guidance puzzle, amplification and multipliers, and optimal monetary policy. Amplification requires countercyclical while solving the puzzle requires procyclical inequality: a Catch-22, resolved in theory if the separate "pure" risk channel is procyclical enough. Price-level-targeting ensures determinacy and is puzzle-free, even when both inequality and risk are countercyclical, thus resolving the Catch-22. The same holds for a rule fixing nominal public debt in the model version with liquidity. Optimal policy with heterogeneity features a novel inequality-stabilization motive generating higher inflation volatility---but it is unaffected by risk, insofar as the target equilibrium entails no inequality.

AB  - We build a New Keynesian business-cycle model with rich household heterogeneity. A central feature is that matching frictions render labor-market risk countercyclical and endogenous to monetary policy. Our main result is that a majority of households prefer substantial stabilization of unemployment even if this means deviations from price stability. A monetary policy focused on unemployment stabilization helps "Main Street" by providing consumption insurance. It hurts "Wall Street" by reducing precautionary saving and, thus, asset prices. On the aggregate level, household heterogeneity changes the trans mission of monetary policy to consumption, but hardly to GDP. Central to this result is allowing for self-insurance and aggregate investment.

AB  - In low-rate environments, policy strategies that involve holding rates "lower for longer" (L4L) may mitigate the effects of the effective lower bound (ELB). However, these strategies work in part by managing the public's expectations, which is not always realistic. Using the Fed's large-scale macroeconometric model, we study the effectiveness of L4L policies when financial market participants are forward-looking but other agents are not. We find that the resulting limited ability to manage expectations reduces but does not eliminate the advantages of L4L policies. The best policies provide adequate stimulus at the ELB while avoiding sizable overshoots of inflation and output.

AB  - This paper proposes a method to identify the non-linear eﬀects of structural shocks by using Gaussian basis functions to parametrize impulse response functions. We apply our approach to monetary policy and ﬁnd that the eﬀect of a monetary intervention depends strongly on (i) the sign of the intervention, (ii) the size of the intervention, and (iii) the state of the business cycle at the time of the intervention. A contractionary policy has a strong adverse eﬀect on output, much stronger than linear estimates suggest, but an expansionary policy has, on average, no signiﬁcant eﬀect on output. An expansionary policy can have some expansionary eﬀect on output, but only if the intervention is large and during a recession. Even so, a contractionary policy is always more potent than its expansionary counterpart.

AB  - The Study empirically examined the impact of monetary policy on selected macroeconomics variables such as gross domestic product, inflation, and balance of payment in Nigeria from (1980-2011).Data were extracted from the Central Bank Statistical Bulletin. Monetary policies played an indispensable role in Nigeria’s economy by regulating and stabilizing the volume of money in circulation in order to create an enabling environment for investment, which will foster economic development. Today, the impact of monetary policy has wider implication and this arises partly because of proactive measures put in place by CBN to ensure macroeconomic stability in the country. The study is designed in such a way that it is an econometric investigation of the impact of monetary policy on economic growth in Nigeria using such econometric tools like the ordinary least square (OLS) regression analysis. The error correction method is used to ascertain if there is a static long run equilibrium relationship among the explanatory variables and subsequently derive an adequate dynamic model of the short run relationship. The study shows that the provision of investment friendly environment in the Nigerian economy will increase the growth rate of GDP.

TI  - The Role for Active Monetary Policy in a Rational Expectations Model
AU  - Weiss, Laurence
T2  - Journal of Political Economy
AB  - The role of monetary policy as it affects available information is examined in an equilibrium model of the business cycle. Exogenous, uncertain changes in the expected return to capital assets relative to money holding are shown to induce revisions in investors' desired portfolios. Under a passive policy, asset market equilibrium requires a change in the value of money, which, if imperfectly perceived, detracts from the signaling aspect of observed prices. Active money growth feedback rules are examined as altering the prospective return to money holding. A policy may be designed to maintain the relative attractiveness between real capital and money even if the controlling authority has no informational advantage. Such a policy is shown to obviate the need for portfolio revisions to assure informational efficiency.

AB  - How effective is monetary policy in inﬂuencing output and employment? How
long do the effects of monetary policy last? These questions have been hotly
debated. In the 1970s and 1980s, they led to a major schism in the economics
profession between Monetarists and Keynesians. This schism seems to have
been resolved now, and a mainstream view can be said to have emerged.

AU  - Blanchard, Olivier
AU  - Summers, Lawrence H.
AB  - Leading economists discuss post–financial crisis policy dilemmas, including the dangers of complacency in a period of relative stability.The Great Depression led to the Keynesian revolution and dramatic shifts in macroeconomic theory and macroeconomic policy. Similarly, the stagflation of the 1970s led to the adoption of the natural rate hypothesis and to a major reassessment of the role of macroeconomic policy. Should the financial crisis and the Great Recession lead to yet another major reassessment, to another intellectual revolution?  Will it?  If so, what form should it, or will it, take? These are the questions taken up in this book, in a series of contributions by policymakers and academics. The contributors discuss the complex role of the financial sector, the relative roles of monetary and fiscal policy, the limits of monetary policy to address financial stability, the need for fiscal policy to play a more active role in stabilization, and the relative roles of financial regulation and macroprudential tools. The general message is a warning against going back to precrisis ways—to narrow inflation targeting, little use of fiscal policy for stabilization, and insufficient financial regulation.ContributorsDavid Aikman, Alan J.

AB  - An effective monetary policy requires a stable relationship between the money stock and macroeconomic variables such as output, price level, interest rates, and exchange rates. A dynamism of structural changes in transition economies of eastern Europe makes such stability far from obvious. This is reflected in the fact that a stable demand for money function cannot be estimated even for the most advanced East European countries: Poland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic. Empirical analysis of the relationship between nominal variables indicates rather limited relationships as well. Therefore, all that can be expected from monetary policy in eastern Europe is not to be too tight so as to starve the economy of needed liquidity and not to be too loose so as to ignite inflation.

AB  - We estimate the effects of monetary policy on price-setting behavior in administrative micro data underlying the German producer price index. We find a strong degree of monetary non-neutrality. After expansionary monetary policy, the mass of additional price adjustments is economically small and the average absolute size across all price changes falls. The aggregate price level hardly adjusts, and monetary policy has real effects. These estimates rule out quantitative structural models that generate small and transient effects of monetary policy through selection on large price adjustments. We provide evidence that monetary policy propagates primarily through production units with weak financial positions.

T2  - Journal of Management for Global Sustainable Development
AB  - Although monetary policy in Cambodia through its policy instruments is likely to have played an active role in contributing to GDP growth, which averaged about 8% annually during the study period; however, as the economy is affected by De Facto dollarization and most of the transactions are made in cash based, especially in US dollars, so this motivates us to conduct this study to examine whether monetary policy has any impact on the economic growth in Cambodia. Literature review revealed that an increase in money supply boosts economic growth, while decrease in interest rate also contributes in economic growth. Using quarterly time series data from 2000 to 2012, this study applied multiple regression model to examine the impact of money supply and interest rate on GDP growth in Cambodia. The results show that money supply has a positive impact on GDP growth, but the strength of impact is relatively weak, while change in interest rate over the study period did not affect economic growth, meaning that there is no significant effect of interest rate on GDP growth. Thus, the study suggests that implementing one currency policy should be considered so that monetary policy can be used more effectively to control economics activities. Also, because only interest rate for foreign loan is used in the study, it is recommended that in the future, a further study about money supply and GDP should include exchange rate in an analysis.

AB  - A three-sector model of the Chinese economy is developed in which the activity of state-owned enterprises (SOEs) is constrained by the state-imposed credit plan for working capital. Our analysis indicates the weaknesses of credit control and nominal interest rate variation as tools for influencing the price level; but the hardening of SOEs' budget constraints is found to be an effective device. The existence of credit and currency controls tends to make devaluation contractionary. Furthermore, because of general equilibrium repercussions, policies that boost industrial exports tend to reduce welfare in the agricultural sector, where poverty is concentrated.

T2  - Journal of Monetary Economics
AB  - Equity markets in the US play an essential role in providing savings instruments for households as well as financing new business investment. In addition, participants in equity markets pay close attention to central bank monetary policy decisions. This attention stems from the important effects that monetary policy may have on inflation, interest rates and real economic activity. Another question is whether central banks should pay close attention to asset markets in forming monetary policy. Gilchrist and Leahy (2001) answer this question by studying three issues. The authors first survey arguments used to define a role for asset prices in monetary policy: 1. asset prices belong in a correct measure of the nominal price level, and 2. asset prices can forecast future inflation. Next, the authors study a trio of dynamic equilibrium models to asses whether linkages between asset prices and real variables justify including asset prices in interest rate rules.

AB  - This paper investigates the monetary transmission mechanism in the Republic of Macedonia to better inform monetary policy, which is currently dedicated to price stability. We analyse long-run equilibrium relationships, adjustment mechanisms and short-run influences between the price level, output and transmission channels: namely, the denar-euro exchange rate; the interest rate; money supply; and - extending the literature - currency substitution. Among our findings are that exchange rate and money supply changes have stronger effects on domestic prices than interest rate changes; devaluation raises currency substitution; and currency substitution attenuates inflationary pressures. We conclude that monetary policy makers in similar economies should take currency substitution into consideration when designing monetary policy and contemplating changes in monetary regime.

In this paper we investigate the changes in the response of the economy to an oil price shock and the role of the systematic monetary policy response in accounting for changes in the response of output, prices, inventories, sales, and the overall decline in volatility. Our results suggest a smaller and more short-lived response of most macro variables during the Volcker-Greenspan period. It also appears that whereas the systematic monetary policy response dampened fluctuations in economic activity during the 1970s, it has had virtually no effect after the “Great Moderation.”

AB  - This paper analyzes the heterogeneous effects of monetary policy on workers with different levels of labor force attachment. Exploiting variation in labor market tightness across metropolitan areas, we show that the employment of populations with lower labor force attachment--Blacks, high school dropouts, and women--is more responsive to expansionary monetary policy in tighter labor markets. We develop a New Keynesian model with heterogeneous workers that explains these results. The model shows that expansionary monetary shocks lead to larger and more persistent increases in the employment of low attachment populations when the central bank follows an average inflation targeting rule and when the Phillips curve is flatter. These findings suggest that the Federal Reserve's recent move from a strict to an average inflation targeting framework will especially benefit workers with lower labor force attachment.

AB  - Australia is a monetary union with strong regional specialization. Manufacturing and service industries are located in the population centres on the south-eastern seaboard, and mining and pastoral activities take place in the interior and north of the continent. Monetary policy affects the interior and north more strongly than the south-eastern seaboard because Australian primary goods are mostly exported and the exchange rate provides the main transmission channel for monetary policy. The Reserve Bank of Australia must consider the economic interests of the interior and north and the south-eastern seaboard. Since monetary policy cannot differentiate between regions, there is a need for interregional macroeconomic risk-sharing.

TI  - Redistributive Monetary Policy
AU  - Brunnermeier, Markus K
AB  - Liquidity and deflationary spirals self-generate endogenous risk and redistribute wealth. Monetary policy can mitigate these effects and help rebalance wealth after an adverse shock, thereby reducing endogenous risk, stabilizing the economy, and stimulating growth. The redistributive channel differs from the classical Keynesian interest rate channel in models with price stickiness. Central banks assume and redistribute tail risk when purchasing assets or relaxing their collateral requirements. Monetary policy (rules) can be seen as an insurance scheme for an economy beset by financial frictions. As with any insurance, it carries the cost of moral hazard. Redistributive monetary policy should be strictly limited to undoing the redistribution caused by the amplification effects, taking into account moral hazard considerations.

AB  - This paper investigates the distributional consequences of monetary policy across generations. We use a life-cycle model with a rich asset structure as well as nominal and real rigidities, calibrated to the euro area using both macroeconomic aggregates and microeconomic evidence from the Household Finance and Consumption Survey. Life-cycle considerations allow to demonstrate the key role of maturing assets (in contrast to balance sheet holdings) for properly assessing the redistributive effects of monetary policy. The redistribution is mainly driven by nominal assets and labor income, less by real financial assets and housing. Overall, we find that a typical monetary policy easing redistributes welfare from older to younger generations, and decreases net worth inequality associated with life-cycle motives.

AB  - Careful identification of the transmission channels of monetary policy is an important step in the global assessment of the major institutional changes. Research in this area should be constantly updated because of the strong structural dynamics. The goal of this paper is to study the monetary transmission in the Russian economy. The study was carried out using the vector autoregression method (VAR). The analysis of impulse functions of interest rate shocks, corporate lending, volume of money supply, growth of prices and the exchange rate was carried out. An interpretation of the transmission channels of the Russian economy was given. The following channels were considered: interest rate, bank lending, cash flows, unforeseen prices and the exchange rate channel. All channels under consideration are statistically confirmed, but they exist with varying degrees of effectiveness. The existence of weak channels of monetary transmission is associated with the depressive state of the economy, lack of its growth in recent years, and high inflation, as well as with the policy of shift from the ruble rate targeting to the inflation targeting policy. The outcomes of use of the standard VAR methods for the developing Russian economy can be used as a guideline for further theoretical and empirical analysis of the transmission mechanism

TI  - The transmission mechanism of monetary policy
AU  - Pétursson, Thórarinn G
AB  - The Central Bank of Iceland bases its monetary policy on setting its interest rate in transactions with
other financial institutions in the money market, in order to affect the behaviour of individuals and
firms, thereby keeping aggregate demand in line with its growth potential and maintaining inflation
expectations which are consistent with the Bank’s 2½% inflation target. The process through which
monetary policy decisions affect aggregate demand in the economy, inflation expectations and the inflation rate is generally known as the monetary policy transmission mechanism. This paper discusses this
process and the lags from monetary policy decisions to its effect on the economy. The findings suggest
that Central Bank of Iceland monetary policy changes are in general first transmitted to domestic
demand after roughly half a year, with a peak effect after one year. Policy first affects inflation after a
year, with a peak effect about 1½ years after the interest rate rise. In the long run, however, monetary
policy has no effects on the real economy. Broadly speaking this is consistent with other countries’experience. It should be underlined that the transmission mechanism is a complex process which may alter
from one time to another.
