TI  - Tax Rules and the Mismanagement of Monetary Policy
AU  - Feldstean, Martin
AB  - This paper emphasizes the importance of the interaction between tax rules and the management of monetary policy. The monetary authorities' failure to recognize the implications of the tax structure has caused them to underestimate just how expansionary monetary policy has been. Moreover, because of our fiscal structure, attempts to encourage investment by an easy-money policy have actually had an adverse impact on investment in plant and equipment. The paper discusses the desirability of substituting a policy of tight-money and positive fiscal incentives for the traditional goals of easy money and fiscal restraint. More generally, the paper stresses the significance of the fiscal structure as a determinant of macroeconomic equilibrium.

AB  - Inflation has always been a central issue of socio-economic policy framework. The mechanism, through which it comes out, is of vital importance to explore for prudent policy formulation. The present study aims at investigating the impact of money supply growth on the rate of inflation in Pakistan. Annually time series data ranges form 1973-2013 is employed for the analysis. The model of the study works out the short-run and the long-run impact of money growth on the rate of inflation in Pakistan. ARDL technique is used, depending upon the time series properties of data that confer mixed order of integration. Diagnostic and stability tests confirm that models are econometrically sound and stable. The results go over the main points; interest rate and money supply are important policy variables for controlling inflation in the long-run while it is the national output level which put downward pressure on inflation rate in the short-run.

AB  - A multi-region, dynamic stochastic general equilibrium (MRDSGE) model is built to show that differences in the price elasticity of housing supply can be related to stylized facts on regional differences in (1) house price level, (2) house price volatility, (3) monetary policy propagation mechanism and (4) household asset portfolio. In addition, regional house prices are found to move more closely with regional fundamentals than with the national GDP. The correlation between the national stock price and the regional housing price also vary significantly across regions, which suggests that optimal portfolio should be region specific.

TI  - Stepping on a rake: The fiscal theory of monetary policy
AU  - Cochrane, John H.
T2  - European Economic Review
AB  - The fiscal theory of the price level can describe monetary policy. Governments can set interest rate targets and thereby affect inflation, with no change in fiscal surpluses. The same basic mechanism describes interest rate targets, forward guidance, open market operations, and quantitative easing. It does not require any monetary, pricing, or other frictions. In the presence of long-term debt, higher interest rates lead to temporarily lower inflation, a challenging sign. I derive and replicate the results of the Sims (2011) “stepping on a rake” model, which first produced this negative sign, and produces realistic impulse-response functions. I show that Sims’ result is robust to many model features, but essentially requires long-term debt.

TI  - The Role of Monetary Policy in Japan: A Break in the 1990s?
AU  - Miyao, Ryuzo
T2  - Journal of the Japanese and International Economies
AB  - This article documents time series evidence suggesting the case for a possible structural break in the role of Japan's monetary policy during the 1990s. It uses a simple vector autoregressive framework and offers some suggestive results: While a persistent effect of monetary policy on real output is detected over the full sample of 1975–1998 and the subsample that ends in 1993, such effect disappears with the recent subsample of the 1990s. The stability analysis also provides more specified evidence that there is a break in the reduced form dynamic system in 1995. Some interpretations are offered to intuitively support these findings.

TI  - Monetary Policy Under Exchange Rate Flexibility
AU  - Dornbusch, Rudiger
AB  - The continuing depreciation of the dollar stands out as one of the big policy issues. It has started to impinge on U.S. monetary policy; it influences the chances for international commercial diplomacy, and it is enhancing the move toward European monetary integration. Above all it leaves most observers with a puzzle as to the causes of the ongoing depreciation. This paper will, of course, not resolve the puzzle. ft rather attempts to layout the basic analytical framework that has been developed for the analysis of exchange-rate questions and to relate it to the question of monetary policy. Part I concentrates on the development of the relevant theoretical framework. The main points to be made here are: (i) exchange rates are primarily deter-mined in asset markets with expectations playing a dominant role; (ii) the sharpest formulation of exchange-rate theory is the "monetary approach, "Chicago's quantity theory of the open economy; (iii) purchasing power parity is a precarious reed on which to hang short-term exchange-rate theory; (iv) the current account has just made it back as a determinant of exchange rates

T2  - Journal of Business & Economic Statistics
AB  - Over the last 25 years, a set of influential studies has placed interest rates at the heart of analyses that interpret and evaluate monetary policies. In light of this work, the Federal Reserve's recent policy of “quantitative easing,” with its goal of affecting the supply of liquid assets, appears to be a radical break from standard practice. Alternatively, one could posit that the monetary aggregates, when measured properly, never lost their ability to explain aggregate fluctuations and, for this reason, represent an important omission from standard models and policy discussions. In this context, the new policy initiatives can be characterized simply as conventional attempts to increase money growth. This view is supported by evidence that superlative (Divisia) measures of money often help in forecasting movements in key macroeconomic variables. Moreover, the statistical fit of a structural vector autoregression deteriorates significantly if such measures of money are excluded when identifying monetary policy shocks. These results cast doubt on the adequacy of conventional models that focus on interest rates alone. They also highlight that all monetary disturbances have an important “quantitative” component, which is captured by movements in a properly measured monetary aggregate.

AB  - This paper examines what we have learned and how we should change our thinking about monetary policy strategy in the aftermath of the 2007-2009 financial crisis. It starts with a discussion of where the science of monetary policy was before the crisis and how central banks viewed monetary policy strategy. It will then examine how the crisis has changed the thinking of both macro/monetary economists and central bankers. Finally, it looks how much of the science of monetary policy needs to be altered and draws implications for monetary policy strategy.

AB  - Vector autoregression (VAR) models often find that inflation increases in response to a tightening
in monetary policy, although standard macroeconomics predicts the opposite. This ‘price puzzle’ is
commonly thought to reflect interest rates being tightened in anticipation of future inflation,
reflecting information possessed by policymakers beyond that contained in the model. Romer and
Romer (2004) and Cloyne and Hürtgen (2016) successfully remove the price puzzle from US and
UK data, respectively, by purging the cash rate of systematic policy responses to central bank
forecasts. We find that this approach does not work for Australia under a wide range of
specifications. This suggests that VARs may not be the most reliable way to analyse monetary
policy.

I undertake variance decompositions to investigate how monetary policy affects the individual components of excess returns (risk-free discount rates, risk premia, or cash flows).

AB  - Purpose The purpose of this paper is to explore the ability of monetary policy to generate real effects in laboratory general equilibrium production economies. Design/methodology/approach To understand why monetary policy is not consistently effective at stabilizing economic activity, the author vary the types of agents interacting in the economy and consider treatments where subjects are playing the role of households (firms) in an economy where automated firms (households) are programmed to behave rationally. Findings While the majority of participants’ expectations respond to monetary policy in the direction intended, subjects do form expectations adaptively, relying heavily on past variables and forecasts in forming two-steps-ahead forecasts. Moreover, in the presence of counterparts that are boundedly rational, forecast accuracy worsens significantly. When interacting with automated households, updating firms’ prices respond modestly to monetary policy and significantly to anticipated marginal costs and future prices. The greatest deviations in behavior from theoretical predictions arise from human households (HH). Households persistent oversupply of labor and under-consumption is attributed to precautionary saving and debt aversion. The results provide evidence that the effects of monetary policy on decision making hinge on the distribution of indebtedness of households. Originality/value The author present causal evidence of the effects of potential bounded rationality on agents’ consumption and labor decisions.

TI  - Monetary Policy and Not Monetary Control: A Rethinking
AU  - Salvary, Stanley C. W.
AB  - The view that prediction is the only important concern when policy is to be developed has led to the strict adherence to a money supply rule via the Quantity Theory of Money with its debilitating consequences. The monetarists place the emphasis on the level of the money supply in the determination of price level changes and monetary control is exercised. Along with this line of thinking, statistical elegance transcends empirical reality. Thus, the ensuing consequences of monetary control are not surprising. There are continuous increases in the general level of prices and increasing problems of unemployment, which fuel the flames of business downsizing.

AB  - A number of academic studies find that either price-level targeting or temporary above-average inflation are nearly optimal policies to address a liquidity trap crisis. Still, central bankers and the public generally question whether even a temporarily higher inflation rate could be beneficial in addressing a liquidity trap or could be consistent with price stability over the longer term. At the same time, however, the Federal Reserve's projections for high unemployment and low inflation do not seem to be consistent with the best monetary policies to address the Fed's dual mandate responsibilities. Accordingly, it is useful to seriously discuss these potentially beneficial alternative policies.

TI  - Reliability of policy announcements and the effects of monetary policy
AU  - Engel, Charles
T2  - European Economic Review
AB  - Monetary authorities regularly announce targets for monetary growth, but the market may not completely trust these announcements because they may not always be truthful. Hence, the market does not have perfect knowledge about future monetary policy and must form its expectations on the basis of information it can extract from the announcements and its observations of the actual money supply. This paper asks how the macroeconomic effect of monetary policy might be altered by more reliable policy announcements, in the setting of a medium-sized open economy. It is found that, contrary to the full-information case, a reduction in monetary growth of 1% may lead on impact to a reduction in inflation of much less than 1%, if the announcements are not very credible. The output costs of lowering inflation are smaller both in the short run and the long run, the more reliable the announcements. However, the plausibility of announcements does not affect the output loss for a given appreciation of the currency. Fluctuations in the exchange rate that are attributable to monetary disturbances beyond the policy-makers' control can nonetheless be dampened by making announcements that are more highly correlated with the truth.

TI  - Three Lessons for Monetary Policy in a Low-Inflation Era
AU  - Reifschneider, David

AB  - The zero lower bound on nominal interest rates constrains the central bank's ability to stimulate the economy during downturns. We use the FRB/US model to quantify the effects of the zero bound on macroeconomic stabilization and to explore how policy can be designed to minimize these effects. During particularly severe contractions, open-market operations alone may be insufficient to restore equilibrium; some other stimulus is needed. Abstracting from such rare events, if policy follows the Taylor rule and targets a zero-inflation rate, there is a significant increase in the variability of output but not inflation. However, a simple modification to the Taylor rule yields a dramatic reduction in the detrimental effects of the zero bound.

TI  - Debt Dynamics and Monetary Policy: A Note
AU  - Laseen, Stefan
AU  - Strid, Ingvar
AB  - "Leaning against the wind" - a tighter monetary policy than necessary for stabilizing inflation around the inflation target and unemployment around a long-run sustainable rate - has been justified as a way of reducing household indebtedness. In a recent paper Lars Svensson claims that this policy is counterproductive, since a higher policy rate actually leads to an increase (and not a decrease) in real debt and the debt-to-GDP ratio. In this note we offer some comments and extensions to Svensson's analysis. In particular, we take Svensson's debt model to the data and show that it provides an incomplete account of short term debt dynamics. Further, the overall analysis of the effects of monetary policy on debt rests on the rather strong assumption that debt is independent of the policy rate, conditional on housing prices. The policy responses advocated by Svensson can therefore be questioned. More importantly, our exercises with a modified model of debt dynamics enables further understanding of how different assumptions affect the assessment of the effects of monetary policy on debt.

AB  - We investigate how the level of household indebtedness affects the monetary transmission mechanism in the U.S. economy. Using state-dependent local projection methods, we find that the effects of monetary policy are less powerful during periods of high household debt. In particular, the impact of monetary policy shocks is smaller on GDP, consumption, residential investment, house prices, and household debt during a high-debt state. We then build a partial equilibrium model of borrower households with financial constraints to rationalize these facts. The model points to the weakening of the home equity loan channel as a possible reason for the decline in monetary policy effectiveness when initial debt levels are high.

AU  - Taylor, John B.
AB  - This paper examines two explanations for the recent spate of complaints about cross-border monetary policy spillovers and calls for international monetary policy coordination, a development that contrasts sharply with the monetary system in the 1980s, 1990s and until recently. The first explanation holds that deviations from rules-based policy at several central banks created incentives for other central banks to deviate from such policies. The second explanation either does not see deviations from rules or finds such deviations benign; it characterises recent unusual monetary policies as appropriate, explains the complaints as an adjustment to optimal policies, and downplays concerns about interest rate differentials and capital controls. Going forward, the goal for central banks should be an expanded rulesbased system similar to that of the 1980s and 1990s, which would operate near an international cooperative equilibrium. International monetary policy coordination - at least formal discussions of rules-based policies and the issues reviewed here - would help central banks get such equilibrium.

AB  - In September 1931, Sweden became the first country to make the stabilization of the domestic price level the official goal of its monetary policy, actually the only country that so far has adopted such an explicit price level target. Starting from the issues and concepts familiar from research and policy experience of inflation targeting – as contrasted to price level targeting – this paper examines the evolution of the Swedish price level targeting in the 1930s. We bring out a number of similarities and differences between price stabilization in the 1930s and in the 1990s.

AB  - This research aims to investigate the impact of monetary policy on agricultural GDP through monetary indicators such as exchange rate, interest rate, money supply and inflation for the period (1990-2014). The relationship was estimated through the (VECM) error correction model using statistical beam. The long run equilibrium relationship between the variables of the model and the results of the estimation of the relationship in the short run revealed that the agricultural GDP is affected by the variables of monetary policy has been found that both inflation and money supply has a positive and significant the effect means that the increase in money supply by 1% will lead to an increase in output. The GDP by 0.25% and this is Identically by the economic logic, in other words, the expansion of any activity needs more capital just the increasing in the inflation rate by 1% will lead to an increase in agricultural GDP by 0.05%.This means that the high level of prices encourages investors and producers to expand production capacities and increase production, while the price of exchange and the price of interest has not proved significant each. In the long term, the most influential variables are the interest rate as a 1% drop in interest rates will lead to higher GDP Agricultural by 0.3%.The Inflation came after the interest rate in terms of impact and came with positive signal and this is opposed to economic logic. The research concluded that inflation has a positive effect on agricultural production in the short and long run. Furthermore, increasing the money supply by expanding credit has a significant role that exceeds the rest of the variables. The research recommended adopting an expansionary monetary policy while taking into consideration the control of inflation with reducing it in the future and contributing to price stability. Including prices of agricultural products and inputs. In addition to incentive private banks to expand agricultural credit and take into account the monetary indicators and development in the making of agricultural policies.

In this paper we argue that the P* approach is flawed. It is certainly more complex than traditional monetarist approaches but the fundamental questions of causality are in no way either affected or resolved. We argue that the P* relationship does not have a causal link with prices but rather the causality runs from prices to money. We also find that there is some causality running from money to real income, so that monetary conditions do seem to have some predictive power for future levels of activity.

AB  - Large-scale asset purchases—and sales too—are likely to become part of the standard toolkit of monetary policymaking. Central banks' purchases since the financial crisis have lowered long-term interest rates relative to short-term rates, and lowered interest rates on more-risky compared to less-risky obligations. Moreover, their introduction fills a conceptual vacuum that has long stood at the heart of monetary policy analysis and implementation. In contrast to the traditional focus on central banks' liabilities, the effectiveness of this policy tool turns on the role of the asset side of central banks' balance sheet. The implications for monetary theory are profound.

Simulation analysis with a calibrated optimizing model indicates that such a policy would probably increase Japan's net imports. The BOJ Law presents some difficulties, but these should be surmountable.

AB  - Climate change and policies to mitigate it could affect a central bank’s ability to meet its monetary stability objective. Climate change can affect the macroeconomy both through gradual warming and the associated climate changes (e.g. total seasonal rainfall and sea level increases) and through increased frequency, severity and correlation of extreme weather events (physical risks). Inflationary pressures might arise from a decline in the national and international supply of commodities or from productivity shocks caused by weather-related events such as droughts, floods, storms and sea level rises. These events can potentially result in large financial losses, lower wealth and lower GDP. An abrupt tightening of carbon emission policies could also lead to a negative macroeconomic supply shock (transition risks). This chapter reviews the channels through which climate risks can affect central banks’ monetary policy objectives, and possible policy responses. Approaches to incorporate climate change in central bank modelling are also discussed.

AB  - A calibrated New Keynesian model of the euro area is used to evaluate the stabilization properties of alternative monetary policy strategies when the natural rate of interest is low (“new normal”) and the probability of reaching the effective lower bound (ELB) is non-negligible. Price level targeting is the most effective strategy in terms of stabilizing inflation and output and reducing the duration and frequency of ELB episodes. Temporary price level targeting is also effective in mitigating the ELB constraint, although its stabilization properties are inferior to those of price level targeting. Backward-looking average inflation targeting performs well and is preferable to inflation targeting. The effectiveness of these alternative strategies hinges upon the commitment of a central bank to keeping the policy rate “lower for longer” and is influenced by agents’ expectation formation mechanism.

AU  - Kiley, Michael T.
T2  - Finance and Economics and Discussion Series
AB  - The equilibrium real interest rate (r*) is the short-term real interest rate that, in the long run, is consistent with aggregate production at potential and stable inflation. Estimation of r* faces considerable econometric and empirical challenges. On the econometric front, classical inference confronts the “pile-up” problem. Empirically, the co-movement of output, inflation, unemployment, and real interest rates is too weak to yield precise estimates of r*. These challenges are addressed by applying Bayesian methods and examining the role of several “demand shifters”, including asset prices, fiscal policy, and credit conditions. We find that the data provide relatively little information on the r* data-generating process, as the posterior distribution of this process lies very close to its prior. This result contrasts sharply with those for the trend growth or natural rate of unemployment processes. Second, credit spreads are very important for the estimated links between output and interest rates and hence for estimates of r*. Estimates of r* that account for this range of considerations are more stable than other estimates, with r* at the end of 2014 equal to approximately 1-1/4 percent.

AB  - This paper analyses the relationship between monetary policy and asset prices in the context of optimal policy rules. The transmission mechanism is represented by a linearized rational expectations model augmented for the effect of asset prices on aggregate demand. Stabilization objectives are represented by a discounted quadratic loss function penalizing inflation and output gap volatility. Asset prices are allowed to deviate from their intrinsic value due to momentum trading. We find that in the presence of wealth effects and inefficient markets, asset price misalignments from their fundamentals should be included in the optimal interest rate reaction function.

We then use the estimated model to assess if unconventional monetary policy tools such as negative interest rates, forward guidance, and asset purchases can provide efficient macroeconomic stabilization in a low nominal and real interest rate environment. While these tools boost output and inflation, the rebound from deep recession can still be painfully slow. Makeup strategies, including average inflation and price level targeting, can further support recovery and reduce downside risks, though the benefits are quite modest under behavioral expectations.

AB  - Exchange rate targeting is considered to be the best policy option in dollarized economies if wages and prices are indexed to the exchange rate. Croatia is a highly dollarized economy; however, our empirical investigation does not reveal a high exchange rate pass-through after stabilization. This finding is robust to different methodologies and suggests that dollarization is limited mostly to financial assets. Therefore, strict exchange rate targeting may not necessarily be the best policy option for Croatia. However, policy implications must be drawn with care due to the endogeneity of the pass-through to the policy regime. Journal of Comparative Economics 32 (3) (2004) 426–444.

Price stability maximizes welfare in the benchmark NNS model because it keeps output at its potential, defined as the outcome of an imperfectly competitive RBC model with a constant mark–up of price over marginal cost.

TI  - Implications of Monetary Policy for Credit and Investment in Sub-Saharan African Countries
AU  - Ndikumana, Léonce
T2  - Journal of African Development
AB  - This paper investigates the implications of monetary policy for domestic investment through its effects on bank lending to the private sector and interest rates in sub-Saharan African countries. The study argues that the pursuit of inflation control through contractionary monetary policy carries high costs in terms of reduced investment and ultimately slower economic growth. The econometric evidence based on a sample of 37 sub-Saharan African countries over 1980-2012 shows that contractionary monetary policy affects domestic investment negatively both indirectly through the bank lending or quantity channel as well as directly through the interest rate or cost of capital channel. The results suggest that policies that maintain a low interest rate regime would stimulate bank lending to the private sector, which in turn would boost domestic investment. The results have important policy implications for African countries in their efforts to achieve and sustain high growth rates as a means of reaching their national development goals notably employment creation and poverty reduction.

TI  - Optimal Monetary Policy Under Bounded Rationality
AU  - Benchimol, Jonathan
AU  - Bounader, Lahcen
AB  - The form of bounded rationality characterizing the representative agent is key in the choice of the optimal monetary policy regime. While inflation targeting prevails for myopia that distorts agents' inflation expectations, price level targeting emerges as the optimal policy under myopia regarding the output gap, revenue, or interest rate. To the extent that bygones are not bygones under price level targeting, rational inflation expectations is a minimal condition for optimality in a behavioral world. Instrument rules implementation of this optimal policy is shown to be infeasible, questioning the ability of simple rules à la Taylor (1993) to assist the conduct of monetary policy. Bounded rationality is not necessarily associated with welfare losses.

TI  - Exploring the Role of the Real Exchange Rate in Australian Monetary Policy
AU  - Dennis, Richard
T2  - Economic Record
AB  - An important issue in small open-economies is whether policymakers should respond to exchange rate movements when they formulate monetary policy. Micro-founded models tend to suggest that there is little to be gained from responding to exchange rate movements, and the literature has largely concluded that such a response is unnecessary, or even undesirable. This paper examines this issue using an estimated model of the Australian economy. In contrast to microfounded models, according to this model policymakers should allow for movements in the real exchange rate and the terms-of-trade when they set interest rates. Further, taking real exchange rate movements into account appears even more important with price level targeting than with inflation targeting.

TI  - On the Effectiveness of Monetary Policy and of Fiscal Policy
AU  - Arestis, Philip
AU  - Sawyer, Malcolm
T2  - Review of Social Economy
AB  - There has been a major shift within macroeconomic policy over the past two decades or so in terms of the relative importance given to monetary policy and to fiscal policy in both policy and theoretical terms. The former has gained considerably in importance, with the latter being rarely mentioned. Furthermore, the nature of monetary policy has shifted away from any attempt to control some monetary aggregate (prevalent in the first half of the 1980s), and instead monetary policy has focused on the setting of interest rates as the key policy instrument. There has also been a general shift towards the adoption of inflation targets and the use of monetary policy to target inflation. This paper considers the significance of this shift in the nature of monetary policy. This enables us to question the effectiveness of monetary policy, and to explore the role of fiscal policy. We examine these questions from the point of view of the "new consensus" in monetary economics and suggest that it is rather limited in its analysis. When the analysis is broadened out to embrace empirical issues and evidence the clear conclusion emerges that monetary policy is relatively impotent. The role of fiscal policy is also considered, and we argue that fiscal policy (under specified conditions) remains a powerful tool for macroeconomic policy. This is particularly an apt conclusion under current economic conditions.

AB  - This paper studies the consequences of a lack of common knowledge in the transmission of monetary policy by integrating the Woodford (2003a) imperfect common knowledge model with Taylor–Calvo staggered price-setting models. The average price set by monopolistically competitive firms depends on their higher-order expectations about not only the current state of the economy but also about the states in the future periods in which prices are to be fixed. This integrated model provides a plausible explanation for the observed effects of monetary policy: it shows analytically how price adjustments are delayed and how the response of output to monetary disturbances is amplified.

AB  - Recent financial crises illustrate the risks of financial volatility and macroeconomic instability during the process of economic growth and development. They also raise issues regarding the management of risks associated with liberalization and global integration. Concerns about the implications of international capital flows for developing countries have grown with the sharply increased volume of these flows since the late 1980s. Some have argued that emerging markets have been the innocent victims of mercurial global investors, while others have questioned the appropriateness of specific policies in the emerging markets themselves. The essays in this volume provide analysis and evidence on the determinants of currency and banking crises in emerging markets, the specific roles of capital flows and the financial sector, and the appropriateness of various policy responses.

TI  - Reallocation Eﬀects of Monetary Policy
AU  - Oikawa, Koki
AU  - Ueda, Kozo
AB  - Central banks across the globe are paying increasing attention to the distributional aspects of monetary policy. In this study, we focus on reallocation among heterogeneous ﬁrms triggered by nominal growth. Japanese ﬁrm-level data show that large ﬁrms tend to grow faster than small ﬁrms under higher inﬂation. We then construct a model that introduces nominal rigidity into endogenous growth with heterogeneous ﬁrms. The model shows that, under a high nominal growth rate, ﬁrms of inferior quality bear a heavier burden of menu cost payments than do ﬁrms of superior quality. This outcome increases the market share of superior ﬁrms, while some inferior ﬁrms exit the market. This reallocation eﬀect, if strong, yields a positive eﬀect of monetary expansion on both real growth and welfare. The optimal nominal growth can be strictly positive even under nominal rigidity, whereas standard New Keynesian models often conclude that zero nominal growth is optimal. Moreover, the presence of menu costs can improve welfare.

T2  - Journal of International Financial Markets, Institutions and Money
AB  - Although numerous studies have examined the effect of monetary policy on stock prices, empirical research in the international setting remains relatively scant. Therefore, this topic is reexamined in the context of Thailand. In a sample of 50 repurchase rate announcements of the Bank of Thailand during 2003–2009, our regression results suggest that the raw change in the repurchase rate has a negative effect on stock returns at the market level, which is inconsistent with the literature. Contrary to the results of numerous studies, we find that at the market level the expected change in the repurchase rate has a negative effect on stock returns and the unexpected change in the repurchase rate exhibits no effect on stock returns. However, the effect of the unexpected change in the repurchase rate on stock returns is evident at the firm level. Our findings also suggest that the stock market's response to the repurchase rate change is asymmetric. The unexpected change in the repurchase rate that is considered as good news has a negative effect on stock returns. Overall, the evidence lends support to the notion that the monetary policy announcements have a significant effect on stock prices and further adds to the debate on whether the creditability of the monetary authority may contribute to the stock market's response to the monetary policy actions.

AB  - We study optimal policy in a business-cycle setting in which firms hold dispersed private information about, or are rationally inattentive to, the state of the economy. The informational friction is the source of both nominal and real rigidity. Because of the latter, the optimal monetary policy does not target price stability. Instead, it targets a negative relation between the nominal price level and real economic activity. Such leaning against the wind helps maximize production efficiency. An additional contribution is the adaptation of the primal approach of the Ramsey literature to a flexible form of informational friction.

AB  - Using a regional VAR, we find large differences in the effects of monetary policy shocks across regions of the United States. We also find that the region-level effects of monetary policy differ a great deal between the pre-Volcker and Volcker-Greenspan periods in terms of their depth and length. The two sample periods also yield very different rankings of the regions in terms of the effects of monetary policy. We find that regional difference in the depths of recession are related to the banking concentration, whereas differences in the total cost of recession are related to industry mix. Finally, we demonstrate that the differences between the two sample periods are due to changes in the mechanism by which monetary policy shocks are propagated.

AU  - Fontana, Marzia
T2  - Pacific Economic Bulletin, Vol. 13 , No. 1, 1998
AB  - There are different views in the literature as to causes of balance of payments disequilibria in developing economies. This article analyses the factors affecting the balance of payments in Fiji over the last twenty years or so, using a monetary model. The monetarist approach argues that domestic credit is the main cause and the cure of a nation?s balance of payments problems, as changes in the money supply are believed to be the primary determinant of changes in total nominal spending. The estimates obtained in this study are weak and that is not surprising, given that Fiji has structural problems and rigidities which do not fit well into the free-market situation of the monetarist theories. It seems plausible to believe that other ?structural factors? such as weather conditions and world market trends play an important role in affecting the balance of payments in Fiji, and it is suggested this should be an area for further research.

The study uses time-series data which spanned between 1986 and 2013.The effects of stochastic shocks of each of the endogenous variables are explored using Error Correction Model (ECM). The study shows that Long run relationship exists among the monetary policy variables and BOP. The core finding of this study shows that monetary policy variables of Exchange rate, Broad money supply and credit to the private sectors are the major monetary factors that determine BOP in Nigeria. The study concluded that monetary policies and implementation capacity is important in the Nigerian economy, because it is very special for determining the provision of interest rate to private sector which produce for export which will have a spill over effect on BOP and economic growth. Also, Balance of Payment is a monetary phenomenon and monetary policy can be used by monetary authority to improve and stabilised the foreign sector performance in Nigeria.

AB  - We quantify the welfare differential between precommitment and discretionary monetary policy in three estimated models of the U.S. economy by calculating the permanent deviation of inflation from target that in welfare terms is equivalent to moving from discretion to precommitment. Using a range of reasonable central bank preference parameters, this "inflation equivalent" ranges from 0.05 to 3.6 percentage points, with a mid-point of either 0.15 or 1-1.5 percentage points, depending on the model. In addition to the degree of forward-looking behavior, we show that the existence of transmission lags and/or information lags is crucial for determining the welfare gain from precommitment.

TI  - Working Paper - 216 - Inflation Targeting Monetary Policy, Inflation Volatility and Economic Growth in South Africa
AU  - Kumo, Wolassa Lawisso
T2  - Working Paper Series
AB  - This paper investigates the impact of inflation targeting monetary policy and inflation volatility on economic growth in South Africa. Inflation volatility is measured by conditional variance generated by fitting an empirical Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Hetroskedasticity (GARCH) model to a seasonally adjusted annualized quarterly consumer price inflation for the period 1960Q1-2013Q3. The volatility measure, together with macroeconomic control variables, was used to estimate economic growth models for two periods corresponding to two monetary policy regimes and a third period covering the full sample. The first period corresponds to the pre-inflation targeting regime covering 1960Q1-1998Q4. During this period, the country had adopted various monetary policy frameworks including exchange-rate targeting, discretionary monetary policy, monetary-aggregate targeting and an eclectic approach. This period was largely characterized by high and more volatile inflation. The inflation volatility in turn had statistically significant negative impact on economic growth during this period. Nonetheless, inflation volatility did not have statistically significant impact on real economic growth during the inflation targeting monetary policy period, i.e. 2000Q1-2013Q3. The empirical results for the combined growth model are consistent with the findings for the two periods. The implication of this is that by adopting the inflation targeting monetary policy framework since 2000, South Africa has succeeded in achieving low and stable general price level thereby creating a conducive environment for economic growth. The higher growth period of the mid 2000s followed the introduction of inflation targeting monetary policy regime. Nevertheless, higher Sacrifice Ratio of disinflation and entrenched structural bottlenecks continue to undermine growth and stifle the spillover effects from low and stable inflation to real economic activities. The government may consider to urgently implement structural reforms to unlock the economic growth potential while ensuring more flexibility in the disinflation policy regime.

AB  - We estimate a measure of the repression of the Chinese price level by developing a simple analytical model which derives a ‘true’ rate of inflation on the basis of the different rates of change of the stock of money in circulation and the nominal value of retail sales. This true rate of inflation is then used to explain changes in quasi-money balances. We estimate this model for the period 1979–1988 using quarterly data. The results strongly support the hypothesis of repressed inflation. The annual rate of inflation of the ‘true’ price index is approximately 12.4 percent higher than that of the official price index over the 10-year period.

TI  - Monetary Policy in a Low Interest Rate World
AU  - Kiley, Michael T.
AU  - Roberts, John M.
T2  - Brookings Papers on Economic Activity
AB  - , Nominal interest rates may remain substantially below the averages of the last half century, because central banks' inflation objectives lie below the average level of inflation, and estimates of the real interest rate that are likely to prevail over the long run fall notably short of the average real interest rate experienced during this period. Persistently low nominal interest rates may lead to more frequent and costly episodes at the effective lower bound (ELB) on nominal interest rates. We revisit the frequency and potential costs of such episodes in a world of low interest rates, using both a dynamic stochastic general equilibrium (DSGE) model and the Federal Reserve's large-scale econometric model, the FRB/US model. Four main conclusions emerge. First, monetary policy strategies based on traditional, simple policy rules lead to poor economic performance when the equilibrium interest rate is low, with economic activity and inflation more volatile and systematically falling short of desirable levels. Moreover, the frequency and length of ELB episodes under such policy approaches are estimated to be significantly higher than in previous studies. Second, a risk adjustment to a simple rule—whereby monetary policymakers are more accommodative, on average, than prescribed by the rule—ensures that inflation averages its 2 percent objective, and requires that policymakers systematically seek inflation near 3 percent when the ELB is not binding. Third, commitment strategies, whereby monetary accommodation is not removed until either inflation or economic activity overshoots its long-run objective, are very effective in both the DSGE and FRB/US models. And fourth, our simulation results suggest that the adverse effects on economic and price stability associated with the ELB may be substantial at inflation targets near 2 percent if the equilibrium real interest rate is low and monetary policy follows a traditional approach. Whether such adverse effects could justify a higher inflation target depends upon the degree to which monetary policy strategies that differ substantially from such traditional approaches are feasible, and an assessment of a broader array of the inflation target's effects on economic welfare.

TI  - On the Relevance or Irrelevance of Public Financial Policy: Indexation,Price Rigidities and Optimal Monetary Policy
AU  - Stiglitz, Joseph E.
AB  - This paper is concerned with delineating conditions under which public financial policies have no real and/or price effects. In the absence of intergenerational distribution effects, public financial policy is irrelevant:an increase in government debt (whether indexed or not), an exchange of anindexed bond for a non-indexed bond, or an exchange of a short term bond fora long term bond has neither real nor financial effects. We also describe changes in financial policy in which the supply of bonds are increased and the nominal interest rate increases, which have an effect on the rate of inflation, but no real effects. We examine the implications of price and wage rigidities and the existence of a non-interest bearing financial asset used for transactions purposes for the validity of these irrelevance theorems.In general, public financial policies have effects on intergenerational distribution; alternative financial policies have implications for the pattern of capital accumulation (an effect which was the center of the literature on money and growth) and on the sharing of risks among members of different generations. We examine the consequences of three alternative financial policies,a fixed supply of financial assets, a fixed price level, and a fixed real supply of government indebtedness; under some plausible conditions, the latter policy may provide for the least intergenerational variability inconsumption.

TI  - On the effects of monetary policy in Vietnam: Evidence from a Trilemma analysis

T2  - The World Economy
AB  - During and after the 2008–09 global financial crisis, the growth cycle of Vietnam's economy has shifted from an average annual growth rate of 7%–8% to an average annual growth rate of 5%-6% with a high level of macroeconomic instability and uncertainty from 2009 till 2016. Related studies have speculated that the operations of monetary policies during this period were not effective in recovering the economic growth and stabilising the overall price level and total output level. This paper provides the first empirical examination of this speculation using the Trilemma framework. Our empirical results show that the State Bank of Vietnam has had adopted a set of policies aiming at maintaining exchange rate stability and interest rate independence while easing the restrictions on capital inflows. The combination of these three monetary policy approaches is found to violate the rule of Trilemma. Consequently, exchange rate and interest rate policies became less effective and failed to stabilise the economy in response to the global economic recession.

AB  - Some recent critics of Russian industrial policy argue that the costs of the Witte System may have been excessive relative to its benefits and that similar rates (or perhaps higher rates) of industrial growth could have been attained if alternate fiscal and monetary policies had been adopted. Once differential rates of growth of prices and real national income are considered, it appears that the Russian money supply was not unduly constrained. The authors also demonstrate that foreign capital inflows made a substantial contribution to Russian economic development, as did the decision to adhere to the international gold standard.

AB  - This paper analyzes the macroeconomic effect of production relocation by using an open economy macroeconomic model. Our analysis shows, paradoxically, that acceleration in production relocation might have an expansive effect on the home economy. We also show that monetary expansion has welfare-enhancing effects even in an economy where production relocation exists. However, advancing production relocation amplifies the effect of monetary policy on the exchange rate. On the other hand, it reduces the effect on the relative home income by advancing production relocation.

TI  - Keeping Up with the Joneses: Implications for the Welfare Effects of Monetary Policy in Open Economies
AU  - Pierdzioch, Christian
AB  - A dynamic general equilibrium two-country optimizing model is used to analyze the welfare effects of monetary policy in open economies. The distinguishing feature of the model is that households' preferences feature a "keeping up with the Joneses" effect. This effect implies that households' utility depends upon the level of their consumption relative to the aggregate level of consumption. The model implies that, depending on the strength of the "keeping up with the Joneses" effect, an expansive monetary policy can be a "beggar-thyself" policy. Moreover, the welfare effects of monetary policy are asymmetric across countries.

TI  - Financial Asset Prices and Monetary Policy: Theory and Evidence
AU  - Smets, Frank
AB  - The work presented in this paper falls into two parts. First, using a simple model and within the context of the central bank's objective of price stability, it is shown that the optimal monetary response to unexpected changes in asset prices depends on how these changes affect the central bank's inflation forecast, which in turn depends on two factors: the role of the asset price in the transmission mechanism and the typical information content of innovations in the asset price. In this context, the advantages and disadvantages of setting monetary policy in terms of a weighted average of a short-term interest rate and an asset price such as the exchange rate - a Monetary Conditions Index (MCI) - are discussed. The second, more empirical, part of the paper documents, using an estimated policy reaction function, the short-term response to financial asset prices, including the exchange rate, in two countries with inflation targets (Australia and Canada) and suggests that the different response to exchange rate changes in these countries can in part be explained by differences in their underlying sources.

TI  - Price Level Risk and Some Long-Run Implications of Alternative Monetary Policy Strategies
AU  - Clouse, James A.
AB  - This note focuses on the longer-run implications of alternative monetary policy strategies for the evolution of the price level. The analysis compares the properties of optimal policy in regimes ranging from pure inflation targeting (IT), to a form of weighted-average inflation targeting (WAIT), to pure price level targeting (PLT). Strategies such as WAIT and PLT tend to limit the downward drift in the path of the price level and also mitigate the uncertainty surrounding the expected path of the price level. The influence of alternative monetary policy strategies on the evolution of the price level may have some important long-run implications for entities or groups that rely heavily on long-term nominal debt. Some simple empirical estimates suggest the real value of existing Treasury debt could be boosted significantly in moving from a world in which the ZLB constraint rarely binds to one in which it regularly binds. Similarly, data from the Survey of Consumer Finances indicate that households at lower income levels, and particularly those with mortgage or educational loans outstanding, are exposed to significant price level risk. As a result, such households can experience a significant reduction in their real wealth, on average, in the transition to a world with frequently binding ZLB constraints. The WAIT and PLT regimes significantly mitigate these potential costs for these groups.

AB  - The goal of this study is to assess the industry effects of monetary policy transmission channels in Nigeria within the period 1981-2014. Techniques of analysis employed in the study are the Johansen cointegration and the error correction model (ECM). Our regression estimates reveal that the private sector credit, interest rate, and exchange rate channels have negative effects on real output growth, both in the long run and in the short run. The results further show that, relatively, the degrees of the established effects are higher in the long run than in the short run. We employed the Johansen cointegration approach to determine the nature of relationship that exists between our dependent variable and the independent variables. The results show that, in the Nigerian case, monetary policy transmission channels jointly have a long-run relationship with real output growth of the industrial sector, and disequilibrium in the system is corrected at the speed of 72.2% annually.

AU  - Hannsgen, Greg
AB  - Many empirical studies have found that interest rate increases have a positive effect on the price level. This paper pursues an obvious, but neglected explanation: interest payments are a cost of production that is at least in part passed on to customers. A model shows that the cost-push effect of inflation, long known as Gibson's paradox, intensifies destabilizing forces and can be involved in the generation of cycles. An empirical investigation finds that the positive association of interest rates with inflation or the log of the price level is present in data from the 1950s to present.

AU  - Carlstrom, Charles T.

T2  - Economic Commentary
AB  - Monetary policy rules help central banks exercise the discipline necessary to achieve their long-term goals. The type of rule many banks are turning to these days is inflation targeting, which has several advantages. But in following the rule, banks usually base their actions on forecasts of future inflation, and this can lead to inflation-rate instability in some cases. A price-level target offers many of the same benefits as an inflation target, but because it uses past inflation to guide the bank’s actions, it avoids this vulnerability.

AB  - This study shows that, in the United States, the effects of monetary policy on credit and housing markets have become considerably stronger relative to the impact on GDP since the mid-1980s, while the effects on inflation have become weaker. Macroeconomic stabilization through monetary policy may therefore have become associated with greater fluctuations in credit and housing markets, whereas stabilizing credit and house prices may have become less costly in terms of macroeconomic volatility. These changes in the aggregate impact of monetary policy can be explained by several important changes in the monetary transmission mechanism and in the composition of macroeconomic and credit aggregates. In particular, the stronger impact of monetary policy on credit is driven by a much higher responsiveness of mortgage credit and a larger share of mortgages in total credit since the 1980s.

The need to carefully reexamine this question gained in urgency as the economic distress story of the mid-1970s unfolded. In recognition of the unsatisfactory state of the economy, a major Federal Reserve System research program was launched under the auspices of the FOMC?s Committee on the Directive. The study?s objective was to produce for the FOMC?s consideration a set of recommendations on how to improve the execution of monetary stabilization policy.

AB  - A 1979 change in U.S. monetary policy coincided with a break in the cyclical behavior of monetary aggregates, while the cyclical behavior of all other real and nominal variables remained relatively constant. A model is developed to assess the quantitative importance of a change in monetary policy in accounting for these observations. The monetary authority's reaction function is estimated conditionally on the theoretical model and accounts for upward of 72–95% of all observed changes, including inside money preceding the business cycle and a qualitative change in the cyclical behavior of the monetary base.

TI  - DRIFT AND BREAKS IN MONETARY POLICY
AU  - Sims, Christopher A
AB  - US monetary policy behavior since 1948 is modeled as nonlinear, changing over time according to a hidden Markov chain speciﬁcation. Though the estimated Markov chain model implies large shifts in the form of the policy reaction function, its improvement in ﬁt over a simple linear model comes almost entirely from its allowance for persistent heteroscedasticity. A linear model that allows such heteroscedasticity ﬁts almost as well. The shifts in policy regime that are uncovered are not unidirectional—they oscillate, with a given state seldom persisting more than a few years. The paper discusses how these results mesh with attempts to interpret this period through the Lucas critique and natural rate models.

AB  - The three-equation New-Keynesian model advocated by Woodford (2003) as a selfcontained system on which to base monetary policy analysis is shown to be inconsistent in the sense that its long-run static equilibrium solution implies that the interest rate is determined from two of the system’s equations, while the price level is left undetermined. The inconsistency is remedied by replacing the Taylor rule with a standard money demand equation. The modified system is seen to possess the key properties of monetarist theory for the long run, i.e. monetary neutrality with respect to real output and the real interest rate and proportionality between money and prices. Both the modified and the original New-Keynesian models are estimated on US data and their dynamic properties are examined by impulse response analysis. Our research suggests that the economic and monetary analysis of the European Central Bank could be unified into a single framework.

AU  - Neri, Stefano

T2  - International Finance
AB  - This paper studies how changes in the federal funds rate by the US Federal Reserve affect the eurozone economy. In our analysis, the international transmission mechanism works through movements in the exchange rate, commodity prices, short-term interest rates and the trade balance. We find that an increase in the federal funds rate causes the euro to immediately depreciate, while commodity, and in particular oil, prices decline sharply, reflecting a decline in demand. Lower commodity prices stimulate household consumption in the short run, and the higher aggregate demand induces an expansion of eurozone economic activity. Our results show that the effects of changes in the federal funds rate on commodity prices are greater than previously found in the literature. Our analysis also assesses the likely effects on the eurozone economy of the European Central Bank's (ECB's) own responses to macroeconomic developments. We find that the expansionary effect of lower commodity prices and a depreciated euro on the eurozone economy is partially offset by the ECB increasing short-term nominal interest rates to curb inflationary pressures in an expanding economy. This result highlights the importance of commodity prices and the euro–dollar exchange rate as inputs into European monetary policy-making, as seen, for example, in the Eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections used by the Governing Council to assess the risks to price stability.

In the paper, the optimal monetary policy maximizes the expected utility of a representative household without having to rely on a set of linearly approximated equilibrium conditions, given the distortions associated with the staggered price-setting. It shows that the complete stabilization of the price level is optimal in the absence of initial price dispersion, while optimal inflation targets respond to changes in the level of relative price distortion in the presence of initial price dispersion.

TI  - Openness and the effectiveness of monetary policy: empirical evidence from Turkey
AU  - Berument, Hakan

T2  - Applied Economics Letters
AB  - The empirical evidence suggests that openness decreases the effect of monetary policy on output, however the effect on prices is not statistically significant. In this study these predictions are tested over the open economy of Turkey for quarterly data from 1987:1 to 2001:1. This study assesses how the openness affects the effectiveness of monetary policy on output and prices.

TI  - Innovation in monetary policy: Challenge and response
AU  - Niehans, Jürg
T2  - Journal of Banking & Finance
AB  - This paper presents some relatively non-technical thoughts on the changing rôle of money under the pressure of declining transactions costs and the innovations in monetary policy-making it induces or requires. In the first part, recent British experience is interpreted as a serious warning about the special rôle of money among financial assets under present-day circumstances and the high cost of disregarding it. While this may please the ‘monetarists’, the remainder of the paper argues, as a counterpoint, that this may not remain so forever. In particular, as argued in the second part, the evolution of the Eurodollar market suggests that the rôle of bank money and the significance of the money multiplier are declining. The third part visualizes the outlines of an economy in which the decline in transactions costs has made money stocks generally obsolete.

TI  - Does Expansionary Monetary Policy Cause Asset Price Booms; Some Historical and Empirical Evidence
AU  - Bordo, Michael D.
AU  - Landon-Lane, John
AB  - In this paper we investigate the relationship between loose monetary policy, low inflation, and easy bank credit with asset price booms. Using a panel of up to 18 OECD countries from 1920 to 2011 we estimate the impact that loose monetary policy, low inflation, and bank credit has on house, stock and commodity prices. We review the historical narratives on asset price booms and use a deterministic procedure to identify asset price booms for the countries in our sample. We show that "loose" monetary policy - that is having an interest rate below the target rate or having a growth rate of money above the target growth rate - does positively impact asset prices and this correspondence is heightened during periods when asset prices grew quickly and then subsequently suffered a significant correction. This result was robust across multiple asset prices and different specifications and was present even when we controlled for other alternative explanations such as low inflation or "easy" credit.

TI  - Pricing Behaviour and the Cost-Push Channel of Monetary Policy
AU  - Lima, Gilberto   Tadeu
AU  - Setterfield, Mark
T2  - Review of Political Economy
AB  - This paper examines the empirical and theoretical status of the cost-push channel of monetary policy, according to which interest rates affect the costs of production and hence pricing behaviour. Particular attention is paid to modelling the cost-push channel in a manner consistent with cost-plus pricing theory, which is identified as the canonical model of pricing behaviour in heterodox economics. It is shown that different variants of cost-plus pricing behaviour give rise to qualitatively different specifications of the cost-push channel, with important consequences for macrodynamics and the conduct of monetary policy.

TI  - The Micro-level Price Response to Monetary Policy
AU  - Balleer, Almut
AU  - Zorn, Peter
AB  - We estimate the effects of monetary policy on price-setting behavior in administrative micro data underlying the German producer price index. After expansionary monetary policy, the increase in the frequency of price change is economically small, the average absolute size across all price changes falls, and the aggregate price level hardly adjusts as a result. These estimates imply a strong degree of monetary non-neutrality because they rule out quantitative structural models that generate small and transient effects of monetary policy through selection on large price adjustments.

AU  - Kim, Seongeun
T2  - Journal of Macroeconomics
AB  - The low-price, low-quality brands change prices more frequently than the high-price, high-quality brands within the same product category. The greater price rigidity for high-quality brands leads to asymmetric effects of monetary policy on the rich and the poor. For instance, monetary policy shocks have larger real effects on high-income consumers who purchase more high-quality brands. This means that the rich benefit more from expansionary monetary shocks but suffer more from contractionary shocks than the poor. I build a menu-cost model with vertically differentiated products. The model predicts that monetary policy shocks have an approximately four times larger impact on the consumption of high-quality brands.
