TI  - Fiscal Theory of the Price Level
AU  - Bassetto, Marco
AB  - The ﬁscal theory of the price level (FTPL) describes ﬁscal and monetary policy rules such that the price level is determined by government debt and ﬁscal policy alone, with monetary policy playing at best an indirect role. This theory clashes with the monetarist view that states that money supply is the primary determinant of the price level and inﬂation. Furthermore, many authors have argued that the ﬁscal rules upon which the FTPL relies are misspeciﬁed. We review the sources of disagreement, and highlight aspects upon which some consensus has emerged.

AB  - The paper reviews the recent literature on monetary policy rules. We exposit the monetary policy design problem within a simple baseline theoretical framework. We then consider the implications of adding various real world complications. Among other things, we show that the optimal policy implicitly incorporates inflation targeting. We also characterize the gains from making a credible commitment to fight inflation. In contrast to conventional wisdom, we show that gains from commitment may emerge even if the central bank is not trying to inadvisedly push output above its natural level. We also consider the implications of frictions such as imperfect information.

TI  - Monetary Policy Strategy: How Did We Get Here?
AU  - Mishkin, Frederic S.
AB  - This paper, which is the introductory chapter in my book, "Monetary Policy Strategy", forthcoming from MIT Press, outlines how thinking in academia and central banks about monetary policy strategy has evolved over time. It shows that six ideas that are now accepted by monetary authorities and governments in almost all countries of the world have led to improved monetary performance: 1) there is no long-run tradeoff between output (employment) and inflation; 2) expectations are critical to monetary policy outcomes; 3) inflation has high costs; 4) monetary policy is subject to the time-inconsistency problem; 5) central bank independence helps improve the efficacy of monetary policy; and 6) a strong nominal anchor is the key to producing good monetary policy outcomes.

TI  - How the World Achieved Consensus on Monetary Policy
AU  - Goodfriend, Marvin
T2  - Journal of Economic Perspectives
AB  - The worldwide progress in monetary policy is a great achievement and, especially considering the situation 30 years ago, a remarkable success story. I describe how the world achieved a working consensus on the core principles of monetary policy by the late 1990s. I survey the muddled state of affairs in the 1970s, and then ask: What happened in Federal Reserve policy to produce an understanding of the practical principles of monetary policy? How did formal institutional support for targeting low inflation abroad follow from an international acceptance of these ideas? And how did a consensus theoretical model develop in academia? I explain how the modern theoretical consensus -- known alternatively as the New Neoclassical Synthesis or the New Keynesian model of monetary policy -- reinforces key advances: the priority for price stability; the targeting of core rather than headline inflation; the importance of credibility for low inflation; and preemptive interest rate policy supported by transparent objectives and procedures. Of course, a working consensus does not constitute complete agreement. Accordingly, the conclusion identifies important monetary policy issues that remain to be explored.

AB  - The price level is falling in Japan. To end deflation, the Bank of Japan should move to a strategy of actively creating bank reserves and money in response to price level deviations from an explicit target. Under the current policy, bank reserves are demand-determined rather than supply-determined. Current procedures limit reserves creation to the amount demanded at a zero short-term interest rate.

TI  - U.S. Monetary Policy During the 1990s
AU  - Mankiw, N. Gregory
AB  - This paper discusses the conduct and performance of U.S. monetary policy during the 1990s, comparing it to policy during the previous several decades. It reaches four broad conclusions. First, the macroeconomic performance of the 1990s was exceptional, especially if judged by the volatility of growth, unemployment, and inflation. Second, much of the good performance was due to good luck arising from the supply-side of the economy: Food and energy prices were well behaved, and productivity growth experienced an unexpected acceleration. Third, monetary policymakers deserve some of the credit by making interest rates more responsive to inflation than was the case in previous periods. Fourth, although the 1990s can be viewed as an example of successful discretionary policy, Fed policymakers may have been engaged in 'covert inflation targeting' at a rate of about 3 percent. The avoidance of an explicit policy rule, however, means that future policymakers inherit only a limited legacy.

AB  - Empirical macroeconomics is plagued by small sample size and large idiosyncratic variation. This problem is especially severe in the case of the transition economies. We utilize a mixed-estimation method incorporating prior information from OECD country data to estimate the parameters of a reduced-form transition economy model. An exactly identified structural VAR model is constructed to analyze monetary policy in the transition economies. The OECD information increases the precision of the impulse response functions in the transition economies. The method provides a systematic way to analyze monetary policy in the transition economies where data availability is limited.

AU  - Selim, Mohammad

T2  - ISRA International Journal of Islamic Finance
AB  - Purpose This paper aims to examine the effects of interest-free and interest-based monetary policy on inflation and unemployment rates for two groups of countries where in one group, interest-free monetary policy (IFMP) was pursued, while in the other group, interest-based monetary policy (IBMP) was followed. Design/methodology/approach This study involves a sample of 23 developed countries divided into two groups. The authors measure economic performance by misery index (MI), and MI is calculated as unemployment rate plus inflation rate. A group of countries, where MI is lower, performs better compared to the other group where MI is relatively higher. Findings The results reveal that in group of 12 countries where IFMP is adopted, the MI is lower and thus performs better compared to a group of countries where IBMP is pursued. Research limitations/implications The findings of this study have profound implications for the policymakers and government leaders who look for a solution to maintain both low inflation and unemployment rates. The findings in this study clearly portray that such ideal situations can only be achieved by pursuing IFMP. No wonder the countries which have been historically pursuing IFMP such as Japan, Switzerland, Sweden, the Netherlands and Denmark have been able to contain both inflation and unemployment rates compared to their counterparts among the English-speaking countries. Originality/value This is one of the most recent tests on the differences in economic performance between IFMP and IBMP. These results have significant value for policymakers and central bankers who have been struggling to maintain lower MI for decades.

AB  - In 1958, A. W. Phillips came up with an empirical negative relation between the rate of inflation and the level of unemployment, quickly christened the Phillips curve (Phillips, 1958). Phillips himself did not present the curve as a policy tool, but less than two years later Paul Samuelson and Robert Solow published a celebrated article in the American Economic Review (1960) in which they did. Given the long period for which the Phillips curve appeared to hold in Britain, Samuelson and Solow concluded that it could be treated as a long-run structural equation which provided the missing equation that the then conventional Keynesian system needed. They treated it as a menu from which the monetary authorities could choose. By tolerating higher inflation they could experience lower average unemployment and vice versa.

TI  - Banking and Interest Rates in a World Without Money: The Effects of Uncontrolled Banking
T2  - Business Cycles and Equilibrium
AB  - This chapter presents a world in which commercial banks and other financial institutions are free to offer checking accounts on any terms they might want to set, and in which there are no reserve requirements. In such a world, it would not be possible to give any reasonable definition of the quantity of money. The payments mechanism would be very efficient, but money in the usual sense would not exist. Thus, neither the quantity theory of money nor the liquidity preference theory of money would be applicable. This chapter illustrates a condition where bank will be happy to bid a customer with positive balances away from another bank, even if it simply redeposits the customer's money with the original bank, because it gets that customer's transactions business. In a world where transactions take place by the transfer of loans, deposits, and notes, the liquidity preference theory is just as inappropriate as the quantity theory. This is true whether one has competitive banking or monopoly banking, and whether banks are regulated by a central bank or are completely unregulated.

T2  - Business Cycles and Equilibrium
AB  - This chapter presents the properties of a neoclassical model, which is similar to those used by growth theorists, including both money and bonds, with a consumption function that depends on wealth. The author has assumed that all markets are continually in equilibrium, that expectations are formed. Additionally, this chapter also discusses an active monetary policy and compare it with a passive monetary policy. An active monetary policy makes little economic sense in this model. There is no way for the government to implement an active monetary policy that is consistent with continual equilibrium in the money and bond markets. These conclusions cast doubt on the stability of the parameters of models that include active monetary policy by allowing markets to be out of equilibrium or by allowing expectations to be formed irrationally. These results suggest that the properties of models that assume passive monetary policy need a great deal more study.

TI  - Rational Economic Behavior and the Balance of Payments
T2  - Business Cycles and Equilibrium
AB  - This chapter presents the implications, for the theory of international trade and the balance of payments, of assuming that individuals behave rationally in the light of all the information available to them. Rational behavior implies that all unemployment is voluntary (or frictional). There is a wage level at which rational employers hire, and if individuals choose not to work at the wage levels implied by the supply of and demand for their skills, then they may be acting rationally, but they are not involuntarily unemployed. On the other hand, if individuals are unemployed for long periods because they think the equilibrium wage for their skills is higher than it is, then they will be acting irrationally. In addition, rational economic behavior is consistent with the existence of finite costs of acquiring information, changing jobs, shifting capital from one use to another or transporting goods from one location to another. Thus, a government cannot control its country's money stock, but must adopt a passive monetary policy.

TI  - Uniqueness of the Price Level in Monetary Growth Models with Rational Expectations
T2  - Business Cycles and Equilibrium
AB  - Monetary growth models have moved in the direction of assuming rational behavior, but they have generally continued to assume that expectations about the rate of inflation are formed in an irrational manner. When a new monetary policy is announced, there are many combinations of a new price level and rate of inflation. Thus, the assumption of rational behavior alone does not allow choosing one from among the many possible paths. Thus, one cannot ignore the mechanism by which monetary policy supposedly influences the price level and other economic variables. One needs a detailed microeconomic model of a monetary economy to have any hope of being able to decide which, if any, of these paths the economy follows. The basic monetary policy examined in this chapter, where next period's growth in the money stock depends on last period's inflation, could be said to imply an “endogenous” money supply, but it assumes that the central bank can fix the money supply in response to whatever economic variables it wants to use.

TI  - Purchasing Power Parity in an Equilibrium Model
T2  - Business Cycles and Equilibrium
AB  - The purchasing power parity theorem is derived from the law of one equilibrium. It says that the relative price of a particular bundle of goods and services in one country and a particular bundle of goods and services in another country is determined entirely by real factors. This theorem makes sense only when there is a market exchange rate between the two countries at which their currencies may be exchanged freely. The particular bundle of goods and services used in each country is the bundle used in calculating the price index in that country. The purchasing power parity theorem is harder to test than either the law of one price or the law of one equilibrium, because it makes use of prices for such a large number of goods and services. There are likely to be substantial errors in some of these prices. In addition, there are likely to be substantial changes over time in the relative prices of some pairs of items from the two indexes. The more the two indexes differ in composition, the more substantial are the changes one expects over time in the relative price of the two bundles.

TI  - Ups and Downs in Human Capital and Business
T2  - Business Cycles and Equilibrium
AB  - Human capital is the ability to earn money. It is defined by how much one will earn at various times in the future will depend on what happens and on what one decides to do; but one's human capital sums up the value of the ways one has of turning effort into income. The value of a person's human capital certainly fluctuates over time. Since, each individual's human capital tends to go up and down with the prospects for the business. The best measure one has of the prospects for businesses generally is the stock market. Therefore, the value of total human capital tends to go up and down with the level of the stock market. Thus, the source of the ups and downs in business and employment can be taken to be uncertainty about the future. Investment decisions must be made with only limited information, and as more information comes in, the value of those investments will fluctuate. Since that is the source of the fluctuations, business will go up and down in a generally random way.

TI  - How Passive Monetary Policy Might Work
T2  - Business Cycles and Equilibrium
AB  - Passive monetary policy means supplying the amount of money that the private sector wants at all times, it means making money freely available in exchange for assets of equal value. If monetary policy is passive, then changes in the stock of money are caused by changes in the public's demand for money, and are not influenced by such things as open market operations. In addition, if monetary policy is passive, then non-monetary forces must cause changes in the price level or the rate of inflation. Subsequently, the demand for money will depend on the price level and the rate of inflation, so there will be a relation between money and prices. The chapter concludes that it turns out that there are many ways for a government to adopt a passive monetary policy. With some, it will be obvious that monetary policy is passive. With others, monetary policy can be passive even though the world believes that it is being used actively to influence economic activity, employment, and inflation.

T2  - Business Cycles and Equilibrium
AB  - This chapter explains that the government does, can only, and should simply respond passively to shifts in the private sector's demand for money, while monetary policy is passive. The pronouncements and actions of the Federal Reserve Board on monetary policy are a charade. The Board's monetary actions have almost no effect on output, employment, or inflation. Many of the living economists seem to believe, that both monetary and fiscal policy are powerful tools for doing good or evil in the economy. They believe in monetary ease, monetary restraint, tax cuts, deficit spending, and trying to get consumers to spend more when the economy seems to have slack. Some of these people even believe that wage and price controls, properly applied at the right times, will have magical restorative effects on the economy.

TI  - Global Monetarism in a World of National Currencies
T2  - Business Cycles and Equilibrium
AB  - The theory called “global monetarism” or “the monetary approach to the balance of payments” generally assumes that it is not necessary to distinguish between the currencies of different countries. With fixed exchange rates, this theory says, an increase in any one country's money stock will cause a world increase in prices by increasing the world's money stock. This theory is based on the notion that money is like gold: it has no national identity. In fact, though, the vast bulk of the money now used in the world have national identity and is not backed in any meaningful sense by gold or an international paper money. In addition, the usual theory of global monetarism assumes that each country's money stock is partly domestic currency and partly international reserves.

TI  - The ABCs of Business Cycles
T2  - Business Cycles and Equilibrium
AB  - Business cycle peaks occur when there is a good match between the types of skills or physical capital wanted in an economy and the types of skills or physical capital available; conversely, troughs occur when wants and skills are poorly matched. The business cycle is largely a matter of choice. That is, the level of business cycle fluctuations reflects the trade-offs people face between (A) expected growth, (B) fluctuations in output, and (C) unemployment. The conventional explanations for fluctuations in output and unemployment all imply that there are unexploited profit opportunities in the world. Moreover, they cannot hold true in an economy that is in continual equilibrium, where people are constantly seeking profit opportunities. It is important to note that business cycles show up in virtually all measures of economic activity—output, income, employment, unemployment, retail sales, new orders by manufacturers; even housing starts.

T2  - Business Cycles and Equilibrium
AB  - This chapter presents the viewpoint that if a government can buy and sell gold freely while maintaining a stock of gold equal to a given fraction of its outstanding money stock, then it can adopt a gold standard with near zero reserves that stabilizes the price level. There is feedback from the gold stock to open market operations and from the price level to the price of gold. The cost of using this method to stabilize the price level would be minimal. Similarly, exchange rates could be maintained indefinitely with near zero reserves, with near zero reserve flows, and with no danger of speculative attack.

TI  - The Trouble with Econometric Models
T2  - Business Cycles and Equilibrium
AB  - The trouble with econometric models is that, while they purport to tell something about causal relations between variables, they almost invariably rely on correlations to imply causation. While correlations can tell much about how variables are statistically related, they tell little about how they are causally related. For any given values of some of the variables, each of the others follows a normal distribution. Many of the problems one encounters in trying to make sense of economic data come from the many ways in which the distribution of the variables can be other than joint normal. The most basic problem, though, is present even when all the variables are random and obey a joint normal distribution. That problem is that of relating correlation and causation.

TI  - General Equilibrium and Business Cycles
T2  - Business Cycles and Equilibrium
AB  - This chapter explains the general equilibrium models, which can give the major features of business cycles. The models include real investment, but information is costless and is available to everyone at the same time. Fluctuations in the match between resources and wants across many sectors create major fluctuations in output and unemployment, because moving resources from one sector to another is costly. Fluctuations in the demand for the services of durable goods causes much larger fluctuations in the output of durables, and causes unemployment that takes the form of temporary layoffs. Consequently, general equilibrium models take individuals as maximizing the expected value of a utility function, where utility depends on consumption at various times of various goods and services, and on state variables that can be taken to represent tastes.

T2  - Business Cycles and Equilibrium
AB  - The effects of noise on the world, and on one's views of the world, are profound. Noise in the sense of a large number of small events is often a causal factor much more powerful than a small number of large events can be. Noise makes trading in financial markets possible, and thus allows one to observe prices for financial assets. Noise causes markets to be somewhat inefficient, but often prevents one from taking advantage of inefficiencies. Moreover, noise in the form of uncertainty about future tastes and technology by sector causes business cycles, and makes them highly resistant to improvement through government intervention. Noise in the form of expectations that need not follow rational rules causes inflation to be what it is, at least in the absence of a gold standard or fixed exchange rates.

T2  - SSRN Electronic Journal
AB  - The economic literature acknowledges that to avoid the resource curse, resourcerich countries should restrict …scal expansion and save a signi…cant part of resource revenues outside the domestic economy. However, in these countries governments tend to ine¤ectively spend a considerable part of windfall revenues in the short run. In this research I construct a DSGE model for a small, open economy to show that if …scal indiscipline in the form of immediate responses to foreign resource revenue changes is inevitable, then monetary policy can help improve the allocation problem. The simulation results indicate that targeting the exchange rate or price level through foreign exchange interventions by the central bank can soften the negative e¤ects of Dutch Disease and stabilize the economy in the face of volatile natural resource revenues in the short run. I also …nd that a …xed exchange rate regime outperforms price level targeting by delivering higher isolation and hence less vulnerability to shocks in natural resource revenues. In contrast, if the central bank chooses to pursue a laissez faire policy, i.e., not to intervene, then the economy becomes vulnerable to shocks in foreign resource revenues and the resource curse becomes more severe.

TI  - The Present and Future of Monetary Policy Rules
AU  - McCallum, Bennett T.
AB  - To consider the prospects, looking 20-30 years into the future, for monetary policymaking in accordance with policy rules, one must evaluate their present importance. That requires some definition of what constitutes rule-based monetary policy in practice, since no actual central bank will ever be literally bound by any simple formula (or any strict optimal control scheme). Consideration of the rules-versus-discretion literature, plus more recent analysis by Woodford (1999), indicates that rule-based policy is conducted to satisfy relationships specified from a timeless perspective.' Given this conception, it seems reasonably clear that today's prominent regimes (e.g., inflation targeting) do largely represent rule-based policymaking. Whether these will prevail into the future will depend in part on political trends, but their fundamental soundness gives room for hope. Regarding the effects of a gradually diminishing role of money, it would appear that the feasibility and attractiveness of rule-based policymaking will not be seriously impaired so long as a tangible medium of exchange has some importance, even if small. In the complete absence of monetary transactions, there would be no monetary policy of any type, rule-based or discretionary. But it seems highly unlikely that money will disappear in the foreseeable future.

TI  - The Impact of Monetary Policy on Economic Growth and Inflation in Sri Lanka
AU  - Amarasekara, Chandranath
AB  - Based on a vector autoregressive (VAR) framework and utilising both recursive and structural specifications, this study analyses the effects of interest rate, money growth and the movements in nominal exchange rate on real GDP growth and inflation in Sri Lanka for the period from 1978 to 2005.
The results of the recursive VARs are broadly in line with the established empirical findings, especially when the interest rate is considered the monetary policy variable. Following a positive innovation in interest rate, GDP growth and inflation decrease while the exchange rate appreciates. When money growth and exchange rate are used as policy indicators, the impact on GDP growth contrasts with established findings. However, as expected, an exchange rate appreciation has an immediate impact on the reduction of inflation. Interest rate innovations are persistent, supporting the view that the monetary authority adjusts interest rates gradually, while innovations in
money growth and exchange rate appreciation are not persistent. Several puzzling results emerge from the study: for most sub-samples, inflation does not decline following a contractionary policy shock; innovations to money growth raises the interest rate; when inflation does respond, it reacts to monetary innovations faster than GDP growth does; and exchange rate appreciations almost always lead to an increase in GDP growth.
The results from the semi-structural VARs, which impose identification restrictions only on the policy block, are not different from those obtained from recursive VARs. The results show that none of the sub-samples since 1978 can be
identified with a particular targeting regime. In contrast, the interest rate, monetary aggregates and the exchange rate, contain important information in relation to the
monetary policy stance. Based on this premise, a monetary policy index is estimated for Sri Lanka. The index displays that unanticipated monetary policy forms a smaller portion of monetary policy action in comparison to anticipated monetary policy. It is also observed that a decline in GDP growth is associated with anticipated policy with a short lag, while reductions in inflation are associated with both anticipated and unanticipated components of monetary policy with a longer lag of 28 to 36 months.

TI  - Monetary policy, parameter uncertainty and optimal learning
AU  - Wieland, Volker
T2  - Journal of Monetary Economics
AB  - Since central banks have limited information concerning the transmission channel of monetary policy, they are faced with the difficult task of simultaneously controlling the policy target and estimating the impact of policy actions. A tradeoff between estimation and control arises because policy actions influence estimation and provide information which may improve future performance. I analyze this tradeoff in a simple model with parameter uncertainty and conduct dynamic simulations of the policymaker's decision problem in the presence of the type of uncertainties that arose in the wake of German reunification. A policy that separates learning from control may induce a persistent upward bias in money growth and inflation, just as observed after unification. In contrast, the optimal learning strategy which exploits the tradeoff between control and estimation significantly improves stabilization performance and reduces the likelihood of inflationary bias.

TI  - Monetary Policy and Inflation Control in Nigeria
AU  - Daniel, Adedeji
AB  - This paper examines the effectiveness monetary policy as an anti-inflationary measure in Nigeria. in order to explore the relationship between inflation and monetary impulses, the cointegration and error correction methods approach were employed on quarterly time series data spanning from 1980Q1 to 2012Q4. The unit roots test shows that all the variables are differenced stationary. The cointegration test indicates a long-run relationship between inflation and the vector of regressors employed. The estimated result reveals that for the period covered, interest rate, exchange rate, money supply and oil-price are the major causes of inflation in Nigeria. It was also observed that although in the short-run increased in income encourages inflation, proper utilization of the growth would reduce inflation. The Money supply variable shows a significant positive impact on inflation both in short and long runs. This means that Nigerian inflationary situation is driven by monetary impulses. As such, antiinflationary monetary policy measures, backed-up by some necessary fiscal policies are incumbent for structural and economic stabilization.

TI  - How 'Unconventional' are Large-Scale Asset Purchases? The Impact of Monetary Policy on Asset Prices
AU  - Rosa, Carlo
AB  - This paper examines the impact of large-scale asset purchases (LSAP) on U.S. asset prices (nominal and inflation-indexed bonds, stocks, and U.S. dollar spot exchange rates) using an event study with intraday data. The surprise component of LSAP announcements is identified from Financial Times articles. Estimation results show that the LSAP news has economically large and highly significant effects on asset prices, even after controlling for the surprise component of the Fed's conventional target rate decision and communication about its future path of policy. This study documents that the cumulative financial market impact of the Fed's LSAP program is equivalent to an unanticipated cut in the federal funds target rate that ranges between zero (for three-month yields) and 197 basis points (for ten-year yields), with the response of stock prices and foreign exchanges lying within this interval. These point estimates are, however, surrounded by considerable uncertainty. By looking at the cross-asset reactions, this work concludes that, for most U.S. asset prices, the effects of asset purchases are not statistically different from an unanticipated cut in the fed funds target rate. Finally, the response of U.K. asset prices (excepting FTSE 100 stocks) to the Bank of England's gilt purchases is quantitatively similar to the reaction of U.S. asset prices to the Fed's asset purchases.

AU  - Leeper, Eric M.
AB  - Every economy faces a "fiscal limit" that delivers the maximum government debt-GDP ratio that can be sustained without appreciable risk of default or higher inflation. But governments in advanced economies issue substantial nominal debt and nominal debt is a commitment to repay in nominal units. When such economies are approaching their fiscal limits, debt can be devalued through higher current and future inflation rates. The paper develops a simple bond market supply-demand apparatus to explain how fiscal policy can be a source of inflation, while monetary policy merely determines the timing of inflation.

AB  - We quantify the importance of heterogeneity for monetary policy using a new heterogeneous-agent VAR (HAVAR) model that integrates national monetary/financial markets with regional housing markets via the mortgage rate. Although the HAVAR model has linear regional VARs, its aggregate impulse responses exhibit two nonlinearities: (1) time variation, stemming from aggregation over heterogeneous regions, and (2) state dependence on initial economic conditions in regions. Thus, monetary policy has "long and variable lags" because monetary transmission depends on the extent and nature of regional heterogeneity, which both vary over time. The model is estimated with data for U.S. regions from 1986 to 1996 and simulated to show how coastal housing booms might influence the efficacy of monetary policy.

Each government should leave its successor with a unique maturity structure for nominal and indexed debt, such that the marginal benefit of a surprise inflation exactly balances the marginal cost. Unlike in earlier papers on the topic, the result holds for quite general Ramsey policies, including time-varying polices with positive inflation and positive nominal interest rates. We compare our results with those in Persson, Persson, and Svensson (1987), Calvo and Obstfeld (1990), and Alvarez, Kehoe, and Neumeyer (2004).

AU  - La Cava, Gianni

T2  - Australian Economic Review
AB  - The effect of monetary policy on housing prices varies significantly across local housing markets. This heterogeneity across local housing markets can be partly explained by variation in housing supply conditions—housing prices are typically more sensitive to changes in interest rates in areas where land is more expensive. The fact that housing prices in more expensive areas are more sensitive to changes in interest rates than in cheaper areas indicates that lower (higher) interest rates increase (decrease) housing wealth inequality. However, the effects of monetary policy on housing wealth inequality appear to be temporary. Other factors also explain the variation in sensitivity to monetary policy across local housing markets with the sensitivity being greater in areas in which incomes are relatively high, households are more indebted and there are more housing investors. This suggests that the sensitivity of housing prices to monetary policy is state dependent.

AU  - Kithandi, Charles Katua
T2  - The International Journal of Business & Management
AB  - This study has been done to address the research gaps in the effect of monetary policy of commercial bank’s financial performance. The key objectives of the study were to establish the following; the effect of changes in central bank rate on financial performance of commercial banks in Kenya, the effect of reserve ratio requirement on financial performance of commercial banks in Kenya and, the effect of repo rate on financial performance of commercial banks in Kenya. The study was carried out covering a five-year time frame period from 2016 to 2020. The independent variables of the study involved: cash reserve ratio, Central bank rate, and the repo rate. Return on equity was used as the dependent variable. The study used descriptive longitudinal research design. The total population consisted of all the commercial banks, which is forty-two in number, licensed to operate in Kenya by the Central Bank of Kenya. The study employed various research tests; Durbin-Watson, quantile-quantile plot and normality test were applied in research finding analysis.    The study found out that a negative relationship exists between both Central Bank rate and cash reserve ratio requirement and return on equity (financial performance) of commercial banks in Kenya. The research findings also showed that a positive relationship exists between repo rate and the return on equity (financial performance) of commercial banks in Kenya. In Conclusion, the study concluded that monetary policy affects profitability and financial performance of commercial banks in Kenya. The study recommends that, for central bank to stimulate economic growth, central Bank rate needed to be monitored and maintained low.

AB  - The effects of monetary policy on agriculture are discussed in the context of a fix-price, flex-price model of the economy. It is shown that the prices of auction-market goods such as agricultural commodities can overshoot their long-run equilibrium levels in response to changes in monetary policy. This is directly related to the stickiness of prices of other commodities, and is a generalization of the Dornbusch model of exchange-rate overshooting. Emprical evidence for both the United States and Australia supports this assumption that different prices have different adjustment speeds.

TI  - Estimating the effects of monetary policy shocks: does lag structure matter?
AU  - Kim, Keuk-Soo
AU  - McMillin, W. Douglas
T2  - Applied Economics
AB  - This paper examines the implications of lag structure for estimating the effects of monetary policy shocks in a VAR. A symmetric lag structure in which all variables have the same lag length and an asymmetric lag structure in which the lag length differs across variables but is the same for a particular variable in each equation of the model are examined. This is important in light of the fact that the true lag structure is generally not known. Four commonly used identification schemes are employed to identify monetary policy shocks. Monte Carlo simulations strongly indicate that the lag structure of a VAR model does matter when assessing the quantitative effects of monetary policy shocks. Given the inherent uncertainty about the true lag structure in practice, it is thus important that one compare the impulse response functions from both symmetric lag and asymmetric lag VARs in assessing the effects of monetary policy shocks.

TI  - Effects of the Monetary Policy Rate on Interest Rates in Nigeria
AU  - Kelilume, Ikechukwu
AB  - Monetary policy rate has remained a major potent monetary policy tool used by monetary authorities in setting targets and direction of other rates and in driving the movement of other macroeconomic aggregates in both developed and developing countries. In Nigeria however, the Central Bank has kept monetary policy rate stable at 12 percent between October 2011 and September 2012 but stability in monetary policy rate is hardly reflected in the movement short term and long term interest rates. The aim of this study is to use the multivariate Vector Autoregressive Model to analyze the effects of monetary policy rate on other rates in Nigeria. The study makes use of monthly data from M1:2007 to M9:2012 to evaluate the cause effect relationships between monetary policy rate and short term and long term rates in Nigeria. The choice of the scope of the study lies in examining the response of interest rates to monetary policy shock since the 2007-2008 global economic crises. Result obtained from this study will be used to track the relative effectiveness of monetary policy in an emerging market where money market instrument is not fully developed.

T3  - Secular Stagnation, Low Interest Rates and Low Inflation: Causes and Implications for Policy
AB  - The secular decline in the equilibrium real interest rate observed over the past decades has materially limited the room for policy-rate reductions in recessions, and has led to a marked increase in the incidence of episodes where policy rates are likely to be at, or near, the effective lower bound on nominal interest rates. Using the ECB’s New Area-Wide Model, we show that, if unaddressed, the effective lower bound can cause substantial costs in terms of worsened macroeconomic performance, as reflected in negative biases in inflation and economic activity, as well as heightened macroeconomic volatility. These costs can be mitigated by the use of nonstandard instruments, notably the joint use of interest-rate forward guidance and large-scale asset purchases. When considering alternatives to inflation targeting, we find that make-up strategies such as price-level targeting and average-inflation targeting can, if they are well-understood by the private sector, largely undo the negative biases and heightened volatility induced by the effective lower bound.

TI  - Supply Shocks and Monetary Policy Revisited
AU  - Gordon, Robert J.
AB  - This paper reviews the main issues that supply shocks pose for the conduct of monetary policy. A simple version of the Gordon-Phelps model shows that the necessary condition for actual real GNP to be maintained at its equilibrium level in the wake of a supply shock is for the change innominal GNP to exceed the change in the nominal wage by the change in the income share of the raw material in GNP. The required "wedge" between nominal GNP and wage growth can be accomplished by any combination of monetary accommodation and nominal wage flexibility. Without this combination a "macroeconomic externality" occurs, with real CNP falling below its equilibrium level. The obstacles to monetary accommodation are examined in terms of a taxonomic wage adjustment equation that allows for differing responses to current inflation, lagged inflation, and lagged wage change. Monetary accommodation is infeasible when there is full indexation to current inflation and creates a permanent acceleration of inflation following a one-time permanent shock when there is indexation to lagged inflation. With "forward-looking" expectation formation in the sense of Taylor, a supply shock is likely to cause changes in parameters of the wage adjustment equation as workers attempt to avoid the macroeconomic externality. The final section of the paper discusses doctrinal debates that originated in part from the empirical failures of earlier Phillips curves that neglected supply shocks.

TI  - The New Tools of Monetary Policy
AU  - Bernanke, Ben S.
T2  - American Economic Review
AB  - To overcome the limits on traditional monetary policy imposed by the effective lower bound on short-term interest rates, in recent years the Federal Reserve and other 
advanced-economy central banks have deployed new policy tools. This lecture reviews what we know about the new monetary tools, focusing on quantitative easing (QE) 
and forward guidance, the principal new tools used by the Fed. I argue that the new tools have proven effective at easing financial conditions when policy rates are 
constrained by the lower bound, even when financial markets are functioning normally, and that they can be made even more effective in the future. Accordingly, the new 
tools should become part of the standard central bank toolkit. Simulations of the Fed's FRB/US model suggest that, if the nominal neutral interest rate is in the range of 2–3 percent, consistent with most estimates for the United States, then a combination of QE and forward guidance can provide the equivalent of roughly 3 percentage 
points of policy space, largely offsetting the effects of the lower bound. If the neutral rate is much lower, however, then overcoming the effects of the lower bound may 
require additional measures, such as a moderate increase in the inflation target or greater reliance on fiscal policy for economic stabilization.

TI  - Transmission Lags of Monetary Policy: A Meta-Analysis
AU  - Havranek, Tomas
AU  - Rusnák, Marek
AB  - The transmission of monetary policy to the economy is generally thought to have long and variable lags. In this paper we quantitatively review the modern literature on monetary transmission in transition and developed countries to provide stylized facts on the average lag length and the sources of variability. We collect 67 published studies and examine when prices bottom out after a monetary contraction. The average transmission lag is 29 months, and the maximum decrease in prices reaches 0.9% on average after a one-percentage point hike in the policy rate. Transmission lags are longer in developed economies (25{50months) than in transition economies (10{20 months). We find that the factor most effective in explaining this heterogeneity is nancial development: greater financial development is associated with slower transmission. Our results also suggest that researchers who use monthly data instead of quarterly data report systematically faster transmission.

AB  - This paper presents theory and evidence on the asymmetric effects of monetary policy on job creation and job destruction. First, it solves a dynamic matching model and it shows how interest rate changes result in an asymmetric response of job creation and destruction. Second, it looks at how changes in the federal fund rate affect gross job flows in the U.S. manufacturing industry, and it finds evidence of asymmetry. Tight policy increases job destruction and reduces net employment changes. Conversely, easy policy appears ineffective in stimulating job creation.

T2  - American Economic Journal: Macroeconomics
AB  - Central bank announcements simultaneously convey information about monetary policy and the central bank's assessment of the economic outlook. This paper disentangles these two components and studies their effect on the economy using a structural vector autoregression. It relies on the information inherent in high-frequency co-movement of interest rates and stock prices around policy announcements: a surprise policy tightening raises interest rates and reduces stock prices, while the complementary positive central bank information shock raises both. These two shocks have intuitive and very different effects on the economy. Ignoring the central bank information shocks biases the inference on monetary policy nonneutrality.

AB  - This paper studies the effects of monetary policy on the expenditure of households of different ages using micro data from the U.S. Consumer Expenditure Survey. I find that contractionary monetary policy shocks reduce the expenditure of young households by significantly more than older households. Households react asymmetrically in part because young households tend to have lower savings and higher labor market risk. This implies that the age composition of the population affects the setting of optimal monetary policy in response to aggregate shocks. Counter-factual analysis suggests that the projected population aging in the U.S. will dampen the pass-through of monetary policy to the economy.

AB  - Monetary union has dawned in Europe. Now that the common currency is a reality, questions concerning the practical conduct of monetary policy in the European Monetary Union (EMU) are moving to the forefront of the policy debate. Among these, one of the most critical is how the new monetary union will cope with the large heterogeneity of its member economies. Given the large differences in economic and financial structures among the EMU member states, monetary policy is likely to affect different member economies in different ways.  Regional Aspects of Monetary Policy in Europe collects the proceedings of an international conference held at the Center for European Integration Studies of the University of Bonn, dedicated to this issue. The contributions to this conference fall into two parts. The first part consists of empirical and theoretical studies of the regional effects of monetary policy in heterogeneous monetary unions. The second part consists of papers analyzing the political economy of monetary policy in a monetary union of heterogeneous regions or member states.  The papers all support the conclusion that regional differences in the responses to a common monetary policy will make European monetary policy especially difficult in the years to come. Such differences arise from a variety of sources, and they cannot be expected to be mere teething troubles that will disappear after a while. Even if they were ignored in the run-up to the EMU, Europe's central bankers and economic policy makers will have to learn how to cope with such differences in the future.

(ii) Has the reaction function of the central bank of Egypt (CBE) differed in the last few years? Using monthly data on the periods 1998-2002 and 2004-2009, the study estimated a structural VAR model in which the Egyptian economy is treated as a small open economy. The results of the study are as follows: (i) The state of foreign economy has significantly affected domestic inflation and real GDP gap in the last few years. (ii) A sudden depreciation of domestic currency no longer supports domestic economic growth and its impact on domestic price level has relaxed. (iii) The impact of monetary policy actions on domestic price has switched to be swift and significant in the last few years. (iv) The CBE does not regularly intervene in the FX market and no longer confines itself with a target for M2. (v) The CBE has been caring about price stability and real GDP growth, respectively. In addition, the CBE has managed monetary policy more independently in the last few years.

T2  - American Economic Review
AB  - The fiscal theory of price determination suggests that if primary surpluses evolve independently of government debt, the equilibrium price level "jumps" to assure fiscal solvency. In this non-Ricardian regime, fiscal policy--not monetary policy--provides the nominal anchor. Alternatively, in a Ricardian regime, primary surpluses are expected to respond to debt in a way that assures fiscal solvency, and the price level is determined in conventional ways. This paper argues that Ricardian regimes are as theoretically plausible as non-Ricardian regimes, and provide a more plausible interpretation of certain aspects of the postwar U.S. data than do non-Ricardian regimes.

TI  - Price-level determinacy and monetary policy in a model with money and trend inflation
AU  - Qureshi, Irfan A.
T2  - Macroeconomic Dynamics
AB  - I examine how money and trend inflation shaped US macroeconomic dynamics during the Great Inflation. I develop a business cycle model with positive trend inflation where money is allowed (but not required) to play a role in determining the equilibrium values of inflation and output through non-separable utility, adjustment costs for holding real balances, and the monetary policy reaction function. The Taylor principle changes in this environment. Targeting money guarantees price determinacy even with trend inflation, but these results are sensitive to the inclusion of non-separability and portfolio adjustment costs. The framework is combined with Greenbook data that detect the role of money in the policy reaction function. The response to money was likely not sufficiently strong to complement the reaction to inflation and counteract the high trend inflation observed during the pre-Volcker period, which most likely led to price indeterminacy.

AB  - In recent years China has faced an increasing trilemma—how to pursue an independent domestic monetary policy and limit exchange rate flexibility, while at the same time facing large and growing international capital flows. This paper analyzes the impact of the trilemma on China's monetary policy as the country liberalizes its good and financial markets and integrates with the world economy. It shows how China has sought to insulate its reserve money from the effects of balance of payments inflows by sterilizing through the issuance of central bank liabilities. However, we report empirical results indicating that sterilization dropped precipitously in 2006 in the face of the ongoing massive buildup of international reserves, leading to a surge in reserve money growth. We also estimate a vector error correction model linking the surge in China's reserve money to broad money, real GDP, and the price level. We use this model to explore the inflationary implications of different policy scenarios. Under a scenario of continued rapid reserve money growth (consistent with limited sterilization of foreign exchange reserve accumulation) and strong economic growth, the model predicts a rapid increase in inflation. A model simulation using an extension of the framework that incorporates recent increases in bank reserve requirements also implies a rapid rise in inflation. By contrast, model simulations incorporating a sharp slowdown in economic growth such as that seen in late 2008 and 2009 lead to less inflation pressure even with a substantial buildup in international reserves.

AB  - We develop a quantitative monetary DSGE model with financial intermediaries that face endogenously determined balance sheet constraints. We then use the model to evaluate the effects of the central bank using unconventional monetary policy to combat a simulated financial crisis. We interpret unconventional monetary policy as expanding central bank credit intermediation to offset a disruption of private financial intermediation. Within our framework the central bank is less efficient than private intermediaries at making loans but it has the advantage of being able to elastically obtain funds by issuing riskless government debt. Unlike private intermediaries, it is not balance sheet constrained. During a crisis, the balance sheet constraints on private intermediaries tighten, raising the net benefits from central bank intermediation. These benefits may be substantial even if the zero lower bound constraint on the nominal interest rate is not binding. In the event this constraint is binding, though, these net benefits may be significantly enhanced.

AB  - This paper explores issues in the relation of debt and monetary policy. Deficits are large, debts are rising absolutely and relative to GDP, unfunded liabilities greatly add to the explicit stock of debt. Debt (and deficits) play a special role at present, in the run up to Maastricht: the membership hurdle in terms of debts and deficits is hardly met by anyone. Debt is important in this context because large debts are seen as a threat to the integrity of the new European money or, at least, a serious complication and potential political pressure point in the exercise of sound monetary policy. But debt is also of interest in a less dramatic context from the simple question of what role it plays in the transmission mechanism of monetary policy.

AB  - In this article, we analyze the implications of price‐setting restrictions for the conduct of cyclical fiscal and monetary policy. We consider standard monetary economies that differ in the price‐setting restrictions imposed on the firms. We show that, independently of the degree or type of price stickiness, it is possible to implement the same efficient set of allocations and that each allocation in that set is implemented with policies that are also independent of the price stickiness. In this sense, environments with different price‐setting restrictions are equivalent.

AB  - This paper studies optimal fiscal and monetary policy under sticky product prices. The theoretical framework is a stochastic production economy. The government finances an exogenous stream of purchases by levying distortionary income taxes, printing money, and issuing nominal non-state-contingent bonds. The main findings of the paper are: First, for a miniscule degree of price stickiness (i.e., many times below available empirical estimates) the optimal volatility of inflation is near zero. Second, small deviations from full price flexibility induce near random walk behavior in government debt and tax rates. Finally, price stickiness induces deviation from the Friedman rule.

TI  - Monetary Policy Lessons of Recent Inflation and Disinflation
AU  - Poole, William
T2  - Journal of Economic Perspectives
AB  - I will consider the monetary policy lessons of the recent inflation and disinflation. The next section of this paper is devoted to the decline of M1 velocity after 1981 and the demise of the "standard" money demand function. Some authors conclude that this evidence leaves us so uncertain about the nature of money demand that policymakers cannot rely at all on any presumed money demand regularities. In contrast, my working hypothesis is that the money demand continues to be a stable function of relatively few variables, but that the interest elasticity of money demand is substantially higher than previously thought. Events have not been kind to Keynesian monetary policy positions either. Keynesians tend to concentrate on interest rates -- especially real interest rates -- as the best guide to the effects of monetary policy on the economy. The real rate is discussed in the third section of the paper. The fourth section is devoted to an analysis of the importance of market expectations about monetary policy, with a particular focus on how market expectations were influenced by the Federal Reserve's introduction of new monetary control procedures in October 1979. The fifth section of the paper contains an evaluation of the contribution of monetary policy to the disinflation of the 1980s. In the sixth and final section, I conclude with some comments on the implications of the previous sections for the debate on monetary rules.

AB  - Empirical modelling of the monetary policy effectsusing conventional linear econometric models is put to a great test when interest rates approach the zero-lower bound. A possible remedy recently proposed in the literature is to introduce a shadow short rate (SSR) obtained from the yield curve model as an alternative monetary policy measure. This paper examines the usefulness of shadow rates as a policy stance measure for the Euro area. Moreover, the SSR canbe used to study the country-specific monetary policy stance. We incorporate the shadow short rate in a standard vector autoregressive analysis to study the effects of monetary policy shocks both at the level of the Euro area and for two periphery EA countries, Italy and Spain, that endured significant financial stress during the crisis. Our analysis shows that monetary policy shocks identified form the SSR produce similar macro responses as shocks identified from the standard policy rate. The Euro area shocks can directly translate to a corresponding change in the country-specific financing conditions in the periphery, whereas the reverse effect is limited. The historical decomposition of the stochastic component of the SSR series shows that the unconventional policy measures were effective in stabilising the sovereign crisis in 2011, however, their relatively limited quantity provided only a weak stimulus to the economy.

AB  - There has been extensive empirical research on the role of credit markets in the transmission of US monetary policy, but the evidence for other countries is scarce. This paper compares the US experience with a set of 13 European countries by examining monetary VARs including banks' balance sheets in the spirit of Bernanke and Blinder (1992). It is shown that the VAR methodology provides plausible results for interpreting interest rate shocks as monetary policy shocks in most countries. The evolution of bank lending after a monetary contraction is then analysed. For most countries, it is shown that bank loans decline more than money in the medium run. In the short run, however, loans are sticky and react less than money. Also, loans and output responses to an increase in interest rate tend to be more synchronized than those of money and output. This evidence is similar to the US and is consistent with the broad credit channel of monetary policy.

AB  - A multivariate regime-switching model for monetary policy is confronted with U.S. data. The best fit allows time variation in disturbance variances only. With coefficients allowed to change, the best fit is with change only in the monetary policy rule and there are three estimated regimes corresponding roughly to periods when most observers believe that monetary policy actually differed. But the differences among regimes are not large enough to account for the rise, then decline, in inflation of the 1970s and 1980s. Our estimates imply monetary targeting was central in the early 1980s, but also important sporadically in the 1970s.

AB  - The question of whether monetary policy should be guided by legislated rules or left to the discretion of the policymaker has been a subject of debate since the early days of central banking. An important episode of the debate occurred in the 1920s when Kansas Congressman James Strong introduced legislation (the Strong bill) which was intended to institutionalize the price level stabilization policy that Benjamin Strong had implicitly followed as head of the New York Federal Reserve Bank from 1923 to 1927.

AB  - Most central banks are required to or choose to stabilize a price index, largely by manipulating short term interest rates. A serious problem is which index to choose among the national income deflator, wholesale prices, the cost of living, with or eliminating highly volatile commodities such as food and energy, to produce a core index, plus others such as housing, including or without imputed rent of owner-occupied houses, or assets, whether equities or houses. No obvious and widely agreed index exists. Even if there were a clear choice, there remains a question whether a central bank should carefully consider action in order to achieve other goals: full employment, adjustment of the balance of payments, of the exchange rate, prevention of bubbles in asset prices, or recovery from financial crises. If so, the question of central bank weapons remains: monetary expansion or contraction, credit controls, for overall or for particular purposes, and moral suasion. JEL Codes: E52, E31

AB  - We describe some of the main features of the recent vintage of macroeconomic models used for monetary policy evaluation. We point to some of the key differences with respect to the earlier generation of macro models and highlight the insights for policy that these new frameworks have to offer. Our discussion emphasizes two key aspects of the new models: 1) the significant role of expectations of future policy actions in the monetary transmission mechanism and 2) the importance for the central bank of tracking the flexible price equilibrium values of the natural levels of output and the real interest rate. We argue that both features have important implications for the conduct of monetary policy.

AB  - Several studies including Blanchard (2004) and Favero and Giavazzi (2004) imply that in emerging market economies, a tight monetary policy within an inflation-targeting framework could actually increase the price level due to the lack of fiscal discipline and the associated high risk premium. We extend their arguments in two ways. First, we introduce a semi structural model with time-varying parameters, where the risk premium is ‘unobserved’ and it is derived within the system. Such an approach fits better with the volatile nature of emerging market economies by allowing us to track down the time-varying effects of macroeconomic dynamics on both the model-consistent risk premium and the other key variables. Second, we obtain impulse response functions and analyze the implications of a tight monetary policy on major macroeconomic variables. Taking the Turkish economy as our reference point, we find that the arguments of Blanchard (2004) and Favero and Giavazzi (2004) seem to be valid.

AB  - This article investigates the effects of monetary policy shocks in the Brazilian economy through the period of July/1999 to January/2008. We follow the procedures suggested by Uhlig (2005) to verify the impact of the monetary policy shock over both inflation and output. The main consequences of a contractionary monetary policy shock are: instantaneous real GDP declines that are large in magnitude; and a drop of 0.4 percent in the price index (IPCA) during the first five months after the shock.

AB  - We investigate the impact of monetary policy uncertainty on bank leverage in China. First, we imply a novel method to measure China’s monetary policy uncertainty. Second, we estimate the relationship between bank leverage ratio and monetary policy uncertainty. Our main finding is that increases in monetary policy uncertainty have a significantly negative impact on bank leverage ratio in China, especially after 2008Q4. Checked with an alternative measurement of China’s monetary policy uncertainty, our finding remains robust.

AB  - For more than two decades the Deutsche Bundesbank has followed a strategy of pre-announcing targets for the growth in broad money. Such consistency has not conflicted with limited flexibility in policy implementation. The stable policy environment may have contributed to the stability of the monetary system in general and money demand in particular, thus facilitating the maintenance of the strategy.

TI  - Does monetary policy matter for trade?
AU  - Wong, Kin-Ming
AU  - Chong, Terence Tai-Leung
T2  - International Economics
AB  - This paper offers empirical evidence to shed light on the trade creation effect of inflation targeting regime. The existing empirical literature mostly focuses on the effect of exchange rate arrangements on trade. Bacchetta and van Wincoop (2000), however, highlight the important role of monetary policy on trade with a full equilibrium model. The literature on the effect of price and cost uncertainty on the behavior of risk-averse firms also suggests a possible negative effect of price level uncertainty on trade. Using the standard gravity model, we find that an inflation targeting regime has a trade creation effect on bilateral trade, but the effect is much more moderate than that under exchange-rate targeting. Unlike a direct peg, however, the moderate effect of inflation targeting exists in the bilateral trade between an inflation targeter and all of its trading partners. This moderate effect is therefore much larger at the multilateral level, suggesting the inflation targeting regime may not have a lower level of total trade than the exchange-rate targeting regime. This view is further supported by an empirical analysis of total trade under the two monetary policy regimes.

T2  - The Quarterly Journal of Finance
AB  - This paper shows that the effects of expansionary monetary policy on the U.S. stock market are asymmetric across different monetary policy phases and different stock market regimes. A Markov-switching dynamic factor model dates the periods of stock market regimes, and generates a new composite measure for overall stock market movements. A time-varying parameter analysis finds that an expansionary monetary policy such as an increase in monetary aggregates or a decrease in the Federal funds rate has positive impacts on stock returns only during the periods in which they are used as monetary policy targets by the Federal Reserve.

AB  - This paper i11ustrates the importance of the fiscal framework for monetary analysis by discussing three separate issues. I begin by examining how the fiscal framework changes the macroeconomic equilibrium associated with different steady state rates of money growth. This includes a summary of research that I have presented elsewhere and comments on several additional aspects of the way in which the fiscal structure destroys the neutrality of monetary policy. The second section deals with the short-run impact of changes in monetary policy. Here again the fiscal structure complicates the economy's response to monetary policy. The final section looks at the effect of the fiscal structure on the central banks choice of monetary policies. Fiscal structures are likely to influence the policies adopted because they affect the costs and benefits of monetary policies.

TI  - Commodity Price Responses to Monetary Policy Surprises
AU  - Scrimgeour, Dean
T2  - American Journal of Agricultural Economics
AB  - Commodity prices are important both as a source of shocks and for the propagation of shocks originating elsewhere in the economy. Many vector autoregression (VAR) studies estimate a gradual response of commodity prices to monetary policy shocks. Exploiting information in high-frequency ﬁnancial market data, and using the methods of Rigobon and Sack (2004) I ﬁnd that a 10 basis point surprise change in interest rates causes commodity prices to fall immediately by about 0.5%. This is about two-thirds of the estimated response of the S&P500, and about ﬁve times larger than the response in a VAR 12 months after the shock. Metals prices tend to respond more than agricultural commodities. The point estimate for oil prices is similar to other commodities, but is estimated imprecisely.

TI  - Boom-Busts in Asset Prices, Economic Instability, and Monetary Policy
AU  - Bordo, Michael D.
AU  - Jeanne, Olivier
AB  - The link between monetary policy and asset price movements has been of perennial interest to policy makers. In this paper we consider the potential case for pre-emptive monetary restrictions when asset price reversals can have serious effects on real output. First, we provide some historical background on two famous asset price reversals: the U.S. stock market crash of 1929 and the bursting of the Japanese bubble in 1989. We then present some stylized facts on boom-bust dynamics in stock and property prices in developed economies. We then discuss the case for a pre-emptive monetary policy in the context of a stylized 'Dynamic New Keynesian' framework with collateral constraints in the productive sector. We find that whether such a policy is warranted depends on the economic conditions in a complex, non-linear way. The optimal policy cannot be summarized by a simple policy rule of the type considered in the inflation-targeting literature.

TI  - The Effect of Monetary Policy on Residential and Structures Investment Under Differential Project Planning and Completion Times
AU  - Edge, Rochelle M.
AB  - This paper analyzes an empirical puzzle regarding the effect of monetary policy on fixed investment, specifically, why residential investment exhibits a strong and rapid response to changes in monetary policy while structures investment manifests a substantially weaker response. The paper proposes an explanation for these contrasting responses that is based on the differential planning and completion times of these two categories of investment as well as inflexibilities in changing the planned pattern of investment spending once the project has begun. Empirical support for the explanation is established by contrasting the responses of U.S. residential and structures building project starts and work undertaken to a monetary policy shock. The paper then shows that a calibrated sticky-price monetary business cycle model with multistage investment projects is capable of generating responses to monetary policy that are broadly consistent with those observed empirically.

AB  - A growing number of countries are anchoring their monetary policy through explicit inflation targeting. This policy has already scored remarkable successes in several countries, establishing central bank credibility, and reining in inflation where it had long been stubbornly high. But implementing inflation targets raises many difficult questions. What prerequisites must an economy and its institutions meet for the strategy to work? What choices should central banks make from the menu of possible variations on the basic approach? This book summarizes the discussions in a seminar at which economists and policymakers from ten countries reviewed their experiences with inflation targeting.

AB  - This paper investigates the relationship between money, prices, output, and the exchange rate in Bangladesh during the 1974–92 period. Several interesting conclusions can be derived from the paper. First, the inflationary process in Bangladesh cannot be explained exclusively by the monetarist or the structuralist explanation of inflation. Second, regardless of the monetary aggregate employed, monetary policy exerts a significant unidirectional impact on real output. Third, monetary policy and inflation together account for a significant portion of fluctuations in the exchange rate. Finally, it is noted that monetary shocks have a strong, but relatively short-run, impact on inflation. In light of these findings, it can be concluded that monetary policy in Bangladesh should be carried out with extreme caution. While tight money may put a short-term halt to inflation and help stabilize the foreign trade sector, it may also cause a slowdown in the economy.

still be relied on as a monetary policy strategy. However, due to a background of
problems, especially those that emerged after the 2008/09 global financial crisis,
various central banks need to strengthen their monetary policy framework through
the application of a non-strict framework, or flexible ITF, with efforts to jointly
stabilize inflation and the real economy in the short term.

AB  - This paper focuses on simple normative rules for monetary policy that central banks can use to guide their interest rate decisions. Such rules were first derived from research on empirical monetary models with rational expectations and sticky prices built in the 1970s and 1980s. During the past two decades substantial progress has been made in establishing that such rules are robust. They perform well with a variety of newer and more rigorous models and policy evaluation methods. Simple rules are also frequently more robust than fully optimal rules. Important progress has also been made in understanding how to adjust simple rules to deal with measurement error and expectations. Moreover, historical experience has shown that simple rules can work well in the real world in that macroeconomic performance has been better when central bank decisions were described by such rules. The recent financial crisis has not changed these conclusions, but it has stimulated important research on how policy rules should deal with asset bubbles and the zero bound on interest rates. Going forward, the crisis has drawn attention to the importance of research on international monetary issues and on the implications of discretionary deviations from policy rules.

AB  - We present a two-country, heterogeneous-agent model in which changes in a country's monetary policy affect real interest rates, relative prices of traded and nontraded goods, and real exchange rates. Nontransitory real effects of monetary policy stem from legal restrictions in the form of country-specific reserve requirements. Without violating the classical assumptions of individual rationality and flexible prices, the model's implications seem qualitatively consistent with the U.S. experience of the 1980s: a monetary policy tightening leading to a rise in the real interest rate and to an initial rise in the real value of the dollar which is subsequently reversed.

AB  - There is a wide consensus that the existence of structural rigidities in the Eurozone reduces the effectiveness of the ECB's monetary policies. In order to test this "ECB-handicap" hypothesis, we perform a meta-analysis of the effects of monetary policies in the US and the Eurozone countries. This consists of collecting the estimated transmission coefficients obtained from published econometric studies. Meta-analysis then allows us to control for a number of factors that can affect these estimated coefficients. We conclude that there is no evidence for the hypothesis that the ECB is handicapped in using monetary policies for the purpose of stabilizing output compared to the US.

TI  - From the gold standard to price level targeting: Swedish monetary policy in the daily press during the 1930s
AU  - Carlson, Benny
AB  - In September 1931, Sweden was forced to abandon the gold standard and the main
objective of Sveriges Riksbank became to stabilize the domestic price level instead of
upholding a fixed exchange rate. It was the first (and only) time a country had adopted
such a policy of price level targeting. This article reviews the reports and the arguments
presented in six leading daily newspapers in connection with and following Sweden’s
transition from the gold exchange standard to the paper standard. This provides an
understanding of how the experiment developed and took shape, the positions held by
different actors and how these positions changed, and what information the general public
– in this sensitive childhood of democracy – had access to.

AB  - We present a two-country structural VAR model of monetary policy and the exchange rate for the US and Australia that allows us to identify both US and Australian monetary policy innovations. A key finding is the asymmetry in the effects of these innovations on the exchange rate, both the nature of the response and their relative importance. A second key finding is evidence of exchange rate disconnect: innovations to the real economy explain little of the variation in the exchange rate. We also consider the effects of exchange rate innovations and find evidence of slow but substantial pass through to domestic prices with evidence that the response of monetary policy is at least partially responsible for the slow adjustment.

TI  - The analysis of monetary policy effects with emphasis on monetary policy strategy types. A VAR approach
AU  - Vasile, Popescu Iulian
AB  - This paper proposes an empirical analysis of monetary policy shocks effects on the real economic aggregates and prices with the help of vector autoregressive (VAR) in the context of Central and Eastern European countries. Model specification is different for each type of monetary policy strategies applied by central banks in the region with the scope of best capturing a series of CEE states distinctive features. Our main results identify a relatively high degree of heterogeneity between the transmission of an unexpected contractionary monetary policy shock (in terms of speed, amplitude and impact persistence) under different monetary policy strategies, which could create major problems for the proper functioning of a monetary union.

TI  - Are Long-Run Price Stability and Short-Run Output Stabilization All That Monetary Policy Can Aim For?
AU  - Fontana, Giuseppe

T2  - Metroeconomica
AB  - A central tenet of the so-called new consensus view in macroeconomics is that there is no long-run trade-off between inflation and unemployment. The main policy implication of this principle is that all monetary policy can aim for is (modest) short-run output stabilization and long-run price stability, i.e. monetary policy is neutral with respect to output and employment in the long run. However, research on the different sources of path dependency in the economy suggests that persistent but nevertheless transitory changes in aggregate demand may have a permanent effect on output and employment. If this is the case, then, the way monetary policy is run does have long-run effects on real variables. This paper provides an overview of this research and explores conceptually how monetary policy should be implemented once these long-run effects are acknowledged.

AB  - Since the creation of the Federal Reserve System, the goal of policymakers has been economic stability. Policymakers’ strategies for achieving that goal have evolved with their understanding of how the world works. An overview of that understanding and of its consequences for monetary policy provides an approximation to a laboratory for understanding what constitutes a stabilizing monetary policy. As an institution, when has the Fed been a major contributor to economic stability, and when has it been a major source of instability? This laboratory provides guidance in the construction of a model that allows for identification of the forces that drive prices and the business cycle. A model allows one to go beyond the correlations of monetary and macroeconomic variables in order to assign causation. It explains how “exogenous” forces, that is, forces emanating from outside the working of the price system, move markets away from stable outcomes. The historical overview here suggests that monetary policymakers still have not settled on a model and a rule for policy that satisfactorily distils the lessons from historical experience. Much work remains in order to achieve consensus on the design of a rule that will make monetary policy into a consistently stabilizing influence.
