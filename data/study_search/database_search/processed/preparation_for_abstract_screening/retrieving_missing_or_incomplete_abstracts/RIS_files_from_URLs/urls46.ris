TI  - Monetary Policy Strategies for the Federal Reserve
AU  - Svensson, Lars E.O.
AB  - The general monetary policy strategy of “forecast targeting” allows the Federal Reserve to respond flexibly to all relevant information in achieving its dual mandate of maximum employment and price stability. In contrast, a simple “instrument” rule such as a Taylor-type rule restricts the Federal Reserve to only respond in a rigid way to the partial information of current inflation and output. Forecast targeting can be used for any of the more specific strategies of annual-inflation targeting, price-level targeting, temporary price-level targeting, average-inflation targeting, and nominal-GDP targeting. These specific strategies are examined and evaluated according to how well they may fulfill the dual mandate, considering the possibilities of a binding effective lower bound for the federal funds rate and a flatter Phillips curve. Nominal-GPD targeting means that GDP and the GDP deflator are considered perfect substitutes. It therefore does not treat maximum employment and price stability as separate and independent targets. In addition, data on GDP and the GDP deflator have longer reporting lags and are subject to substantial ex post revisions. The latter will require both retrospective and prospective revisions of the target path, with large communication difficulties. Average-inflation targeting has good prospects of handling the problems of a binding effective lower bound and a flatter Phillips curve. As a permanently applied strategy, it would also have good possibilities of becoming understood by and credible with markets and the general public.

TI  - ON THE DESIGN AND EFFECTS OF MONETARY POLICY IN THE MIDDLE EAST
AU  - Kandil, Magda
T2  - International Journal of Economics, Management and Accounting
AB  - In trying to evaluate the autonomy of central banks in the Middle East, the paper examines the determinants and implications of monetary policy across a sample of countries in the region: Algeria, Egypt, Jordan, Kuwait, Morocco, Saudi Arabia, Syria and Tunisia. Monetary policy is often established as a tool to facilitate government objectives. However, some of the announced objectives - price stability, economic growth, and full employment - may be contradictory. The governments may then set the reaction function for the monetary authority to devote more attention to specific objectives that they judge to be more urgent for economic performance. Models that attempt to identify the reaction function for the monetary authority differentiate between two types of policies: rules or accommodative policies versus discretion or stabilizing policies. An accommodative policy provides a regular supply of credit to an expanding economy. A stabilizing policy, in contrast, varies the money supply to counter shocks that may deviate the economy from its objectives. The present paper seeks to shed some light on the design of monetary policy across countries that have kept a sufficient data record for empirical investigation. The empirical investigation proceeds in two steps. The first step seeks to identify the reaction function for the design of monetary policy. The second step seeks to evaluate the varying effects of monetary policy in the light of variations in the policy design. Specifically, empirical models are estimated to identify the effects of growth in money supply on real output growth and price inflation.JEL classification: E51, E52, E58, N15Key words: Monetary policy, Economic growth, Middle-East countries

AB  - The impulse response function (IRF) of an aggregate variable is time-varying if the IRFs of its components are different from each other and the relative magnitudes of the components are not constant—two conditions likely to be true in practice. We model the behaviour of loan components and document that the induced time variation for total loans is substantial, which helps to explain why studies describing total loans have had such a hard time finding a robust response of total bank loans to a monetary tightening.

TI  - The Transmission Mechanism for Monetary Policy in Developing Countries
AU  - Montiel, Peter J.
T2  - Staff Papers
AB  - In many developing countries the financial system is characterized by the absence of organized markets for securities and equities, by capital controls, and by legal ceilings on bank borrowing and lending rates – a situation that gives rise to parallel markets for foreign exchange and informal loan markets. This paper analyzes how changes in monetary policy instruments are transmitted to domestic aggregate demand in a financially repressed economy. Such an analysis is necessary to understand how the move to a more market-oriented system would affect the economy in the short run.

AB  - We study cross-country differences in monetary policy transmission across the largest euro area economies (France, Germany, Italy, and Spain) using a large Bayesian vector autoregressive (BVAR) model with endogenous prior selection. Drawing on the posterior distributions of the cross-country differences in impulse responses and on other tests, we find real output and the money supply to respond more strongly in Germany to monetary policy than in the other countries. Whereas, the price level response is strongest in Spain and weakest in Germany. Longer-term interest rates react more strongly in Germany and France than in Italy and Spain.

AB  - The first six years of ECB monetary policy are examined using a general framework that allows central bankers to weight differently positive and negative deviations of inflation, output and the interest rate from their reference values. The empirical analysis on synthetic euro-area data suggests that the objective of price stability is symmetric, whereas the objectives of real activity and interest-rate stabilizations are not. Output contractions imply larger policy responses than output expansions of the same size, while movements in the interest rate are larger when the level of the interest rate is relatively high. The hypothesis of M3 growth-rate targeting is rejected.

T2  - Applied Economics
AB  - New evidence on the transmission of monetary policy to the economy is provided through an analysis of the effects of a restrictive monetary policy shock on Italian flow of funds over the period 1980 to 2002. Firms reduce issuance of debt and decrease the acquisition of financial assets, providing no support for the existence of strong financial frictions. Following the shock, in the first quarter households increase short-tem liabilities and diminish the acquisition of liquid assets and shares. The public sector increases net borrowing during the first 2 years. Financial corporations decrease their borrowing for three quarters while in the same period the foreign sector increases borrowed funds. We claim that our results shed new light on the role of the financial decisions of the economic sectors in the transmission mechanism of monetary policy.

T2  - Journal of International Economics
AB  - We study the effects of U.S. monetary policy shocks on the bilateral exchange rate between the U.S. and each of the G7 countries. We also estimate deviations from uncovered interest rate parity conditional on these shocks. The analysis is based on a structural vector autoregression in which monetary policy shocks are identified through the conditional heteroscedasticity of the structural disturbances. Unlike earlier work in this area, our empirical methodology avoids making arbitrary assumptions about the relevant policy indicator or transmission mechanism in order to achieve identification. At the same time, it allows us to assess the implications of imposing invalid identifying restrictions. Our results indicate that the nominal exchange rate exhibits delayed overshooting in response to a monetary expansion, depreciating for roughly ten months before starting to appreciate. The shock also leads to large and persistent departures from uncovered interest rate parity. Variance-decomposition results indicate that monetary policy shocks account for a non-trivial proportion of exchange rate fluctuations.

AB  - This paper deduces an open economic DSGE model and explores two monetary policy rules for China, the quantity and price rule. The empirical results indicate that (1) monetary policy with money supply as instrument seems increasingly difficult to conduct in China than before, (2) the linkage between money supply and output becomes weaker over time, and (3) the effects of a price rule on the economy seem to have become more significant than those of a quantity rule. The findings seem to favor the government’s intention of liberalizing interest rates and making a more active use of the price instrument as the economy becomes more market-oriented in recent years.

AB  - The paper reconsiders the role of money and banking in monetary policy analysis by including a banking sector and money in an optimizing model otherwise of a standard type. The model is implemented quantitatively, with a calibration based on US data. It is reasonably successful in providing an endogenous explanation for substantial steady-state differentials between the interbank policy rate and (i) the collateralized loan rate, (ii) the uncollateralized loan rate, (iii) the T-bill rate, (iv) the net marginal product of capital, and (v) a pure intertemporal rate. We find a differential of over 3% p.a. between (iii) and (iv), thereby contributing to resolution of the equity premium puzzle. Dynamic impulse response functions imply pro- or counter-cyclical movements in an external finance premium that can be of quantitative significance. In addition, they suggest that a central bank that fails to recognize the distinction between interbank and other short rates could miss its appropriate settings by as much as 4% p.a. Also, shocks to banking productivity or collateral effectiveness call for large responses in the policy rate.

AB  - A customer market model in which firms and customers form long-term relations is developed and integrated into the canonical New Keynesian framework. This leads to two important differences compared to the standard model. First, the purely forward-looking Phillips curve is replaced by a hybrid variant where current inflation also depends on past inflation. Second, the welfare cost of inflation is much lower, which leads to an optimal monetary policy where relatively more weight is put on output gap stabilization than previously found in the literature.

AB  - Indonesia's depreciation vastly exceeded that of all other countries hit by the Asian crisis. Indonesia also experienced far higher inflation. This paper argues that there is a close medium to long-term relationship between money growth and inflation in Indonesia, and that this has not been greatly disturbed by the crisis. It argues that the country's disappointing performance in relation to maintaining the value of the rupiah can be explained by the central bank's failure to sterilise the monetary impact on base money of its last-resort lending to the banks. The fundamental lesson is that Bank Indonesia would be well advised to adopt slow and steady growth of base money as the nominal anchor for monetary policy, now that the pre-crisis policy of slow and steady depreciation of the rupiah has been abandoned.

We analyze the transmission channels of the fiscal and monetary policies through estimation of a Philips curve and the fiscal IS curve. The results indicate that the fiscal deficit is statistically significant and affects the inflation rate indirectly via output gap. The empirical findings using the Leeper model indicate that the monetary policy is passive whereas the fiscal policy is active. In this context, we found empirical evidence that the Brazilian economy shows a fiscal dominance regime for the period 1995: I to 2006: II.

TI  - Monetary Policy and Asset Price Bubbles: Calibrating the Monetary Policy Trade-Offs
AU  - Filardo, Andrew J.
AB  - The issue of monetary policy and asset prices has been receiving much attention not only because it is an interesting topic for macroeconomists but also because central banks have faced daunting challenges from large swings in various types of asset prices. To some extent, the achievement of a low, stable inflation environment has not simultaneously brought about a more stable asset price environment. The record over the past decade, in fact, has raised the prospect of asset price booms and busts as a permanent feature of the monetary policy landscape. This paper lays out a general framework to explore some of the key monetary policy trade-offs presented by asset prices, with particular emphasis on the role of asset price bubbles. The paper first discusses what economists mean by asset price bubbles before putting forward a stylised macroeconomic model in which a monetary authority can influence the behaviour, in only an indirect way, of the path of asset prices. The baseline model suggests that central banks should systematically respond to asset price developments generally and asset price bubbles specifically. Indeed, there are good reasons for the central bank to focus only on asset price bubbles, rather than the fundamental component of asset prices, when calibrating its monetary policy response. This general result does not depend on the volatility of asset prices per se or necessarily on the  ability to distinguish fundamental movements in asset prices from asset price bubbles. The paper then introduces a form of uncertainty - intrinsic paradigm uncertainty about the existence of bubbles - to show how policymakers might want to weigh the options of responding or not responding in such an environment. The paper then goes beyond the confines of the model to offer insights about issues such as moral hazard, non-linearities, multivariate bubbles and communication strategies.

AB  - In this paper, we analyze the interactions between monetary and macro-prudential policies and the circumstances under which such interactions call for their coordinated implementation. We start with a review of the interdependencies between monetary and macro-prudential policies. Then, we use a DSGE model incorporating financial frictions, heterogeneous agents and housing, which is estimated for the euro area over the period 1985-2010, to identify the circumstances under which monetary and macro-prudential policies may have compounding, neutral or conflicting impacts on price stability. We compare inflation dynamics across four 'policy regimes' depending on: the monetary policy objectives – that is, whether the policy instrument, the short-term interest rate factors in financial stability considerations by leaning against credit growth; and the existence, or not, of an authority in charge of a financial stability objective through the implementation of macro-prudential policies that can 'lean against credit' without affecting the short-term interest rate.

TI  - Asymmetric Eﬀects of Monetary Policy Shocks
AU  - Agenor, Pierre-Richard
AB  - This paper examines, using small-scale vector autoregression models, the extent to which monetary policy shocks have asymmetric effects on the cyclical component of output, inﬂation, and the rate of exchange rate depreciation. It begins by reviewing potential sources of asymmetry. It then discusses three approaches to testing for the presence of asymmetric eﬀects in the transmission of monetary shocks: the ﬁrst relies on the sign of the output gap, the second on the initial level of of the monetary policy instrument itself, and the third on the initial level of inﬂation. Estimation results, using quarterly data, are presented for Korea, Malaysia, the Philippines, and Turkey. Impulse response functions indicate that monetary policy shocks (measured as innovations in, alternatively, the money market rate, the discount rate, and the monetary base) have signiﬁcant asymmetric eﬀects which vary across instruments and countries. However, some of the typical “puzzles” identiﬁed in recent VAR studies are also present in these results.

AB  - This paper analyses the effects of a change in monetary policy on firms’ investment in Germany, France, Italy and Spain using a data set which provides aggregated balance sheet and profit and loss account data for 17 different industries and three different size classes. The main findings are twofold. First, in each of the four countries a change in the user cost of capital, which in turn is affected by interest rates, has both statistically and economically significant effects on investment. Second, while the average interest rate on debt is generally higher for small firms than for large firms, there is little evidence that the effects of monetary policy on small firms are larger.

TI  - Price-Level Determination Under Dispersed Information and Monetary Policy
AU  - Aoki, Kosuke
T2  - The Japanese Economic Review
AB  - This paper considers the determination of aggregate price level under dispersed information. A Central Bank sets policy in response to its noisy measure of the price level, and each agent makes its decisions by observing a subset of data. Information revealed to the agents and the bank is determined endogenously. It is shown that the aggregate state of the economy is not revealed perfectly to anybody but this economy behaves as if it is a representative-agent economy in which the representative agent has perfect information while the Bank has partial information. The Bank’s information set affects fluctuations in the price level through its effect on policy.

TI  - Central bank independence and monetary policy- making institutions: past, present and future
AU  - CUKIERMAN, ALEX
T2  - Designing Central Banks
AB  - Two decades ago and earlier most central banks in the world functioned as 
departments of ministries of finance. By law, custom or both, they were expected 
to utilise their policy instruments to achieve myriad objectives such as high 
levels of growth and employment, provision of funds to government for the 
financing of public expenditures and to address balance of payments problems.1
They were also expected to maintain financial and price stability but the pricestability objective was one among several other objectives in the charter of the 
Bank and had no particular status. In some cases like Spain and Norway it did 
not even appear in the charter. Paralleling this state of affairs, economic theory 
did not attribute particular importance to central bank independence (CBI) and 
the concept of credibility of monetary policy was in the early stages of development. Furthermore, a notable legacy of the Keynesian revolution was the belief 
that a certain amount of inflation is conducive to economic growth.
 Although some banks had a reasonable amount of legal independence, the 
level of actual independence, particularly in developing countries, was usually 
lower than the one indicated in the law. Except for a few cases central banks did 
not possess instrument independence and the responsibility for price stability 
was, at least implicitly, located in the ministry of finance and other economic 
branches of government. In a few developed economies (such as the United 
Kingdom, Japan, the United States and West Germany) with wide capital 
markets, price stability was maintained mainly through the actions of relatively 
conservative treasury departments or because of de facto independent central 
banks.2

TI  - The Effects of Monetary Policy Shocks in a Small Open Economy: A Structural VAR Approach
AU  - Bhuiyan, Rokon
AB  - This paper develops an open-economy structural VAR model for Canada in order to estimate the effects of monetary policy shock, using the overnight target rate as the policy instrument. To increase the precision of parameter estimates of my over-identiﬁed structural VAR model, where some contemporaneous variables simultaneously interact with each other, I use a Bayesian Gibbs sampling method to estimate the model. I ﬁnd that the policy shock transmits to real output through both the interest rate and the exchange rate. I also ﬁnd that the contractionary policy shock induces a departure from UIP in spite of the deprecation of the exchange rate after an impact appreciation. On the other hand, the contractionary monetary policy of raising the target rate is not exactly followed by a decrease in the monetary aggregate.

TI  - The sectoral effects of monetary policy in Hungary: A structural factor analysis
AU  - Pellényi, Gábor
AB  - This paper uses a structural factor model to analyze sectoral heterogeneity in the impact of monetary policy in Hungary. Monetary shocks are identified with sign restrictions. The impulse responses of aggregate variables are similar to the findings of previous VAR based studies. The sectoral responses reveal considerable heterogeneity. In particular, sectors more reliant on external finance show larger output responses, while healthier corporate balance sheets imply weaker price responses. These results suggest that the credit channel of monetary transmission is operating in Hungary as well. In addition, there appears some role for the interest sensitivity of demand and price rigidities in explaining the heterogeneity of sectoral responses.

TI  - An oil demand and supply model incorporating monetary policy
AU  - Askari, Hossein
AU  - Krichene, Noureddine
T2  - Energy
AB  - Oil price inflation may have had a significant role in pushing the world economy into its worst post-war recession during 2008–2009. Reserve currency central banks pursued an overly expansionary monetary policy during 2001–2009, in the form of low or negative real interest rates and accompanied by a rapidly falling US dollar, while paying inadequate attention to the destabilizing effects on oil markets. In this paper, we show that monetary policy variables, namely key interest rates and the US dollar exchange rate, had a powerful effect on oil markets. World oil demand was significantly influenced by interest and dollar exchange rates, while oil supply was rigid. Oil demand and supply have very low price elasticity and this characteristic makes oil prices highly volatile and subject to wider fluctuations than the prices of other commodities. Aggressive monetary policy would stimulate oil demand, however, it would be met with rigid oil supply and would turn inflationary and disruptive to economic growth if there was little excess capacity in oil output. We argue that a measure of stability in oil markets cannot be achieved unless monetary policy is restrained and real interest rates become significantly positive. Monetary tightening during 1979–1982 might imply that monetary policy has to be restrained for a long period and with high interest rates in order to bring stability back to oil markets.

AB  - The monetary policy mechanism by which monetary policy was transmitted to the
real economy had emerged as the pivotal discussion topic recently. This paper tried to discuss
the impact of Bank Indonesia’s monetary policy on loan bank. By using simple loan bank
framework we concluded that monetary policies were able to influence loan bank. The
monetary variables such as discount rate policy, base money and exchange rate policy were
very important in determining the banking credit. As the credit was very important to influences
the economic activitiy, the result provided evidence that monetary policy was important as a
tool to control economic activity via credit channel. The validity of this study challenged the
hypotheses that monetary policy was death. However, monetary policy maker should carefully
consider the soundness of the banking industry because it was a strategic partner for monetary
authority to control the economic activities.

TI  - Monetary Policy and the Slope Factor in Empirical Term Structure Estimations
AU  - Wu, Tao
AB  - This paper examines the empirical relationship between the movement of the slope factor in term structure of nominal interest rates and exogenous monetary-policy shocks in the U.S. after 1982.  Using first a six-variable VAR model and then a GMM estimation model of the Taylor rule, I estimate the exogenous monetary-policy shocks implied by each of them in the U.S. during this period.  Meanwhile, a two-factor model is used to extract the underlying slope factor of the term structure.  Results from the correlation study suggest that there is strong correlation between the slope factor and the exogenous monetary-policy shocks.  Moreover, monetary-policy shocks can explain a large part of variability of the slope factor.  This study provides strong evidence in support of Knez, Litterman and Scheinkman (1994)'s conjecture on the relation between the slope factor and the Federal Reserve policy, and is also consistent with the results in Wu (2001a)'s general-equilibrium based simulation study.

The results point out that there is a long run relationship between the variables under consideration. We find that an unexpected oil price increase is followed by an increase in price level and a decline in output in Ghana. We argue that monetary policy has in the past been with the intention of lessening negative growth consequences of oil price shocks, at the cost of higher inflation.

TI  - Measuring Systematic Monetary Policy
AU  - Hoover, Kevin D.
AU  - Jorda, Oscar
AB  - The 1970s and early 1980s witnessed two main approaches to the analysis of monetary policy.  The first is the early new classical approach of Lucas, based on the assumptions of rational expectations and market clearing.  The second is the atheoretical econometrics of Sims' VAR program.  Both have developed:  the new classical approach has been enriched through various accounts of price stickiness, cost of adjustment or alternative expectational schemes; the original VAR program has developed into the structural VAR program.  This paper clarifies the relationship between these two programs.  Based on work of Cochrane (1998), it shows that the typical method of evaluating unanticipated, unsystematic monetary policy is correct only if the conditions necessary for Lucas' policy-ineffectiveness proposition hold, while recent methods for evaluating systematic monetary policy violate Lucas' policy-noninvariance proposition ("the Lucas critique").  The paper shows how to construct and estimate (using regime changes) a model in which some agents form rational-expectations and others follow rules of thumb.  In such a model, monetary policy actions can be validly decomposed into systematic and unsystematic components and valid counterfactual experiments on alternative systematic monetary-policy rules can be evaluated.

AU  - Akalpler, Ergin

T2  - Journal of Economic and Administrative Sciences
AB  - Purpose The purpose of this paper is to investigate the relationship between monetary policy and economic growth in the light of a developing economy, with the main focus on Malaysia. Primarily, the research will concentrate on the interactions between interest rates, inflation, money supply and growth in GDP, which will serve as the instrument for measuring economic growth. Design/methodology/approach The research will apply quantitative analysis to determine the relationship between GDP growth and monetary policy instruments, particularly interest rate, money supply and level of inflation. Given the advancement and achievement in econometric analysis and computer software creation, the least-squares estimates analysis will be used to investigate the relationship and significance between these variables. Findings It is observed that relationship between economic growth and inflation is positive. This entails that a 1 percent change in inflation will result in a 77 percent increase in the level of economic growth in this economy. The linkage between economic growth and interest rates has also been observed to be positive. A positive nexus can be observed between economic growth and money supply. The coefficient value of 0.02 for money supply growth shows that it has the smallest effect on economic growth amongst the variables tested in the model. Research limitations/implications Based on the findings of this study, the following recommendations can be made, which could serve as policies instruments for Malaysian economic development. This does not mean that the findings can be generalized for other developing economies. Practical implications Observations from the test for economic application significance are based on the signs of the parameters. It was observed that inflation, interest rates and money supply all have a positive relationship with economic growth, which is in line with the a priori expectations. This means that monetary policy has positively affected the economic growth. Social implications The results of the OLS analysis reveal that the monetary policy instruments used for the model demonstrated that monetary policy has a positive relationship with economic growth in Malaysia. A breakdown of the individual monetary policy instruments shows that the interest rate, inflation and money supply all have individual positive relationships with economic growth. Originality/value A positive relationship exists between economic growth in Malaysia and all selected monetary instruments, namely, inflation, money supply and interest rate. The results show that the results show that inflation, interest rate and money supply will cause the economy to grow but their contribution to the developments is affected from other policy instruments which are used by the governments.

AB  - The paper assesses the quantitative importance of a channel of monetary transmission operating through firms' balance sheets. It studies the effects of monetary policy on the investment behaviour of various categories of Italian firms, using a panel from the Company Accounts Data Service (Centrale dei Bilanci) and a detailed reconstruction of the user cost of capital at firm level. We estimate that a considerable portion (possibly up to one third) of the overall effects of monetary policy is transmitted through the balance-sheet channel. Small firms, firms which have a larger share of assets that cannot be used as collateral, firms with less cash flow or less liquidity are more affected by monetary policy. In quantitative terms, the difference in the response of investment by different types of firms turns out not to be negligible.

The paper emphasizes the existence of several dimensions in which the recent literature provides a new perspective on the linkages among monetary policy, inflation, and the business cycle. It is argued that the adoption of an explicitly optimizing, general equilibrium framework has not been superfluous; on the contrary, it has yielded many insights which, by their nature, could hardly have been obtained with earlier non-optimizing models.

AU  - Maitra, Biswajit

T2  - International Journal of Economics and Business Research
AB  - Sri Lanka is an open and market-oriented lower middle income economy situated in South Asia. It is one of the fastest growing economies in Asia and developing world in the recent years. Sri Lankan economy has achieved 6.4% growth over the period 2003 to 2012. At the same period the economy has experienced 10.4% inflation. This paper studies efficacy of monetary policy in Sri Lanka to raise income and stabilising price level in the recent period Q1: 2002-03 to Q4: 2013-14, when exchange rate has become more flexible. Empirical analysis has found that both income and price maintain long run relation with money, interest rate and exchange rate. Dynamics of such relations is studied by the estimation of vector error correction model which reveals that money supply causes a raise in income and price level. Depreciation of Sri Lankan currency depresses income and raises price level. A higher interest rate depresses income but stabilises price level. Robustness of these findings is confirmed through the estimation of unrestricted vector autoregression model, the Wald test followed by impulse response functions and variance decomposition analysis. The findings testify for an effective monetary policy in Sri Lanka over the period more importantly, when the economy also has realised a gloomy environment of global economic crisis in 2008.

TI  - Should monetary policy respond to asset price misalignments?
AU  - Kontonikas, Alexandros

T2  - Economic Modelling
AB  - This paper analyses the relationship between monetary policy and asset prices using a structural rational expectations open economy model that allows for the effect of asset prices and exchange rates on aggregate demand. We assume that asset prices and exchange rates follow a partial adjustment mechanism whereas they are positively affected by past changes, thus allowing for ‘momentum trading’, while at the same time we allow for reversion towards fundamentals. We then conduct stochastic simulations using two alternative monetary policy rules, inflation-forecast targeting and the standard Taylor rule. The results indicate that, under both rules, interest rate setting that takes into account asset price misalignments leads to lower overall macroeconomic volatility, as measured by the postulated loss function of the central bank.

T2  - Revisiting the Case for Flexible Exchange Rates
AB  - This paper uses a stochastic Dynamic General Equilibrium Model to analyze the economic and welfare consequences for Canada of two alternative exchange rate and monetary policy rules: a flexible exchange rate regime with a price-level target and a permanently fixed exchange rate regime, which might occur with the formation of a North American monetary union. The model is calibrated to Canadian data and then simulated to determine the impact of term-of-trade shocks on key macroeconomic variables under the two regimes. The main finding of the paper is that employment, output, and consumption are much more volatile under a fixed exchange rate. Because agents are risk-averse, this volatility has significant welfare costs. The study also shows that transactions costs would have to be implausibly high and agents almost risk neutral for the welfare advantage of a flexible exchange rate to disappear.

Dynamic strategic complementarity, in which an increase in a firm’s price increases the optimal price set by the rival firm in the following periods, increases steady-state price and the real effect of monetary policy. However, when temporary sales arise as a mixed strategy, the real effect of monetary policy decreases considerably.

TI  - Overview of Monetary Policy in the Nepalese Context
AU  - Ghimire, Ramesh
T2  - Economic Journal of Nepal
AB  - Monetary policy is one of the most important policies to manage aggregate demand. Like other policies, the primary objectives of monetary policy to attain the macro economic goal or objectives such as stability, growth, full employment, favorable balance of payment and so on. Before liberalization, Nepal Rastra Bank followed direct monetary instruments such as interest rate, margin rate, statutory reserve requirements (SLR), and so on. However, after economic liberalization, indirect instruments such as cash reserve ratio, open market operation and bank rate have been used. These instruments first affect the aggregate demand and thereby it affects real sector variables such as price level, income, employment, output, and so on. But in Nepalese case, like other policies, monetary policy has not been effective to achieve its goals or objectives because price level is not explained by money supply alone. This present paper has made an attempt to overview the impact of monetary policy in terms of some macroeconomic indicators such as price level, economic growth, balance of payment and equity.

AB  - This paper examines the different policy rules proposed by Henry Simons, who, beginning in the mid-1930s, advocated a price-level stabilization rule, and by Milton Friedman, who, beginning in the late-1950s, advocated a rule that targeted a constant growth rate of the money supply. Although both rules shared the objective of eliminating the policy uncertainty emanating from discretion, they differed because of the different views of Simons and Friedman about the stability of secular relationships. Simons’ rule relates to modern rules that emphasize the pursuit of price stability as representing optimal monetary policy.

The opposite is found for a policy tightening: large real effects but small effects on prices. Nonlinearities are estimated using a new and simple procedure based on linear Strutural Vector Autoregressions with exogenous variables (SVARX). We rationalize the result through the lens of a simple model with downward nominal wage rigidities.

AB  - This paper investigates the return and volatility response of major European and US equity indices to monetary policy surprises by utilizing extensive intraday data on 5-min price quotes along with a comprehensive dataset on monetary policy decisions and macroeconomic news announcements. The results indicate that the monetary policy decisions generally exert immediate and significant influence on stock index returns and volatilities in both European and the US markets. The findings also show that press conferences held by the European Central Bank (ECB) that follow monetary policy decisions on the same day have a clear impact on European index return volatilities. This implies that they convey additional important information to market participants. Overall, our analysis suggests that the use of high frequency data is critical to separate the effect of monetary policy actions from those of macroeconomic news announcements on stock index returns and volatilities.

T2  - Handbook of Monetary Economics
AB  - This chapter discusses the major conceptual developments in the literature of targets and instruments of money policy, with particular emphasis on the broader strategic issues defining the overall framework within which policy operates. The instrument problem of the selection of specific price or quantity that the central bank directly and immediately controls is examined in the chapter. It is a fact that what most people mean by money in discussions of monetary policy is not a plausible policy instrument at all, because it is endogenous in the kind of fractional reserve banking system common to most modern market economies. Hence, money is at best an intermediate target of monetary policy. The chapter discusses the implications of alternative monetary policy frameworks for the information available to the economy's private sector, the positive empirical question of when and whether any given central bank has actually based its operations on one kind of targeting strategy or another, and the empirical basis for making the normative selections of monetary policy targets and instruments.

AB  - This paper is an empirical investigation of the transmission of monetary policy in South Korea. It combines modern mainstream macroeconomics with aspects of a developing economy with financial dualism through a simple IS-LM type model that explicitly incorporates an informal credit market. Vector autoregression analysis, with both semistructural and structural identifications, confirms the importance of a credit variable as a policy tool. The results show direct credit allocation by the central bank had a significant impact on output, prices, and the interest rate in the informal sector. Previous theoretical and empirical findings of “stagflationary” effects of monetary policy are refuted.

The model matches important features of postwar data well and provides a structural explanation of the correlation between real output and the short-term nominal rate of interest. We perform a battery of monetary-policy experiments which show that, as viewed through the lens of this model, monetary policy has struck a good balance recently among competing monetary-policy objectives.

AB  - We argue that the time-varying regional distribution of housing equity influences the aggregate consequences of monetary policy through its effects on mortgage refinancing. Using detailed loan-level data, we show that regional differences in housing equity affect refinancing and spending responses to interest rate cuts, but these effects vary over time with changes in the regional distribution of house price growth. We build a heterogeneous household model of refinancing with mortgage borrowers and lenders and use it to explore the monetary policy implications arising from our regional evidence. We find that the 2008 equity distribution made spending in depressed regions less responsive to interest rate cuts, thus dampening aggregate stimulus and increasing regional consumption inequality, whereas the opposite occurred in some earlier recessions. Taken together, our results strongly suggest that monetary policy makers should track the regional distribution of equity over time.

TI  - Sectoral Output Effects of Monetary Policy: Do Sticky Prices Matter?
AU  - Henkel, Lukas
AB  - This paper studies the role of sticky prices for the monetary transmission mechanism, using disaggregated industry-level data from 205 US industries. There is substantial heterogeneity in the output responses of industries to monetary policy surprises. I show that an industry's response to monetary policy surprises is systematically related to an industry's degree of price stickiness as measured by the average frequency of price adjustment. The size of the differential reaction is economically large and statistically significant. The results suggest that sticky prices play an important role in the transmission of monetary policy, consistent with New Keynesian macroeconomic models. This result is robust to the inclusion of further industry-level control variables.

The purpose of this paper is to determine whether a model economy that is reasonably calibrated can account for such large inflation-rate effects. The answer is yes. (JEL O41, E58)

AB  - This paper examines the economic environments in which past U.S. stock market booms occurred as a first step toward understanding how asset price booms come about and whether monetary policy should be used to defuse booms. We identify several episodes of sustained rapid rise in equity prices in the 19th and 20th Centuries, and then assess the growth of real output, productivity, the price level, money and credit stocks during each episode. Two booms stand out in terms of their length and rate of increase in market prices – the booms of 1923-29 and 1994-2000. In general, we find that booms occurred in periods of rapid real growth and productivity advance, suggesting that booms are driven at least partly by fundamentals. We find no consistent relationship between inflation and stock market booms, though booms have typically occurred when money and credit growth were above average.

TI  - The veil of deception over money: how central bankers and textbooks distort the nature of banking and central banking
AU  - Häring, Norbert
AB  - In this paper, an attempt is made to evaluate the desirability of ultra easy monetary
policy by weighing up the balance of the desirable short run effects and the
undesirable longer run effects – the unintended consequences. The conclusion is that
there are limits to what central banks can do. One reason for believing this is that
monetary stimulus, operating through traditional (“flow”) channels, might now be less
effective in stimulating aggregate demand than previously. Further, cumulative
(“stock”) effects provide negative feedback mechanisms that weaken both supply and
demand over time. It is also the case that ultra easy monetary policies can eventually
threaten the health of financial institutions and the functioning of financial markets,
threaten the “independence” of central banks, can encourage imprudent behavior on
the part of governments, and can worsen income distribution as well. None of these
unintended consequences is desirable. Since monetary policy is not “a free lunch”, all
it buys is time. Governments must use this time to set the policy levers they control to
support strong, sustainable and balanced growth at the global level.

AU  - Weeks, John
T2  - Review of Political Economy
AB  - The standard policy rule of the Mundell-Fleming model states that under a flexible exchange rate regime with perfectly elastic capital flows, monetary policy is effective and fiscal policy is not. The rule ignores the effect of a change in the nominal exchange rate on the domestic price level. The price level effect is noted in some textbooks, but not formally analyzed. When subjected to a rigorous analysis, the interaction of the exchange rate and the domestic price level substantially changes the standard policy rule. The logically correct statement would be, with a flexible exchange rate and perfectly elastic capital flows, the effectiveness of monetary policy depends on the marginal import propensity and the sum of the trade elasticities. Typical values for these parameters suggest that the effectiveness of monetary policy under flexible exchange rates can be low even if capital flows are perfectly elastic. Because these same parameters have the opposite effect on fiscal policy, the relative effectiveness of fiscal and monetary interventions under a flexible exchange rate is an empirical issue that cannot be determined a priori.

TI  - Responding to a Monetary Superpower: Investigating the Behavioral Spillovers of U.S. Monetary Policy
AU  - Gray, Colin
T2  - Atlantic Economic Journal
AB  - Between 2002 and 2006, the Federal Reserve set interest rates significantly below the rates suggested by well-known monetary policy rules. There is a growing body of research suggesting that this helped fuel an excess of liquidity in the U.S. that contributed to the 2008 worldwide financial crash. It is less well known that a number of other central banks also lowered interest rates during this period. An important question, then, is what role the Federal Reserve played in influencing other central banks to alter their own monetary policies, which could have magnified the Fed’s actions in creating global liquidity. This paper addresses the issue by showing how spillovers in central bank behavior occur in theoretical rational expectations models. It then establishes empirically how U.S. monetary policy actions affect the actions of other major central banks, particularly in terms of interest rates and currency interventions. The models and data suggest that the U.S. lowering its policy rate, either in general or in reference to a monetary policy rule, influences other central banks to lower their own policy rates and intervene in currency markets, even when controlling for worldwide macroeconomic trends. It thus appears that U.S. actions were a factor in the worldwide lowering of interest rates and the increase in currency reserves in the early 2000s that may have contributed to the subsequent global liquidity boom.

AB  - This paper examines the interactions between money, interest rates, goods and commodity prices at a global level. Aggregated data for major OECD countries are therefore analysed in a cointegrated VAR framework. Our empirical results for the period ranging from the 1970s to 2008 support the view that, when controlling for interest rate changes and thus different monetary policy stances, money (defined as a global liquidity aggregate) is still a key factor to determine the long-run homogeneity of commodity and goods prices movements.

T2  - Investment Management and Financial Innovations
AB  - High and sustainable growth of gross domestic product with stable inflation is one of the objectives of the most macroeconomic policies both in the world and in Vietnam. Therefore, price stability plays a vital role in assuring GDP growth. In order to stabilize prices, fiscal and monetary policies need to be appropriately managed. The aim of this study is to assess the impact of the monetary and fiscal policies on inflation in Vietnam during the period from 1997 to 2020. This study has applied the vector autoregression (VAR) model along with data gathered from the World Bank and General Statistics Office of Vietnam. The research results indicate that Vietnam’s inflation is positively influenced by a fiscal deficit (2.943), money supply (2.672), government expenditure (8.347), and interest rate (3.187). Among the factors, government expenditure has the biggest influence on inflation. Besides, trade openness (–0.311) also influences inflation, but the effect is negative and negligible. Finally, the policy implications are focused on coordinating fiscal and monetary policies maintaining a moderate level of inflation for economic growth.

AB  - We analyze the distributional effects of monetary policy on income, wealth and consumption. We use administrative household-level data covering the entire population in Denmark over the period 1987-2014 and exploit a long-standing currency peg as a source of exogenous variation in monetary policy. We consistently find that gains from softer monetary policy in terms of income, wealth and consumption are monotonically increasing in the ex-ante income level. The distributional effects reflect systematic differences in exposure to the various channels of monetary policy, especially non-labor channels (e.g. leverage and risky assets). Our estimates imply that softer monetary policy increases income inequality.

AB  - This paper uses standard econometric models of monetary policy to derive measures of policy shocks to the Federal funds rate. The measures of funds rate shocks are used to test 1) if positive and negative funds rate shocks have an asymmetric effect on real GDP growth and 2) if the effectiveness of monetary policy depends on whether or not the economy is in a recession. The results suggest that monetary policy is equally effective in a recession or expansion and that positive funds rate shocks have a larger absolute value impact on real GDP growth than negative funds rate shocks.

AU  - Di Tella, Sebastian
AU  - Kurlat, Pablo
AB  - We propose a model of banks’ exposure to movements in interest rates and their role in the transmission of monetary shocks. Since bank deposits provide liquidity, higher interest rates allow banks to earn larger spreads on deposits. Therefore, if risk aversion is higher than one, banks' optimal dynamic hedging strategy is to take losses when interest rates rise. This risk exposure can be achieved by a traditional maturity-mismatched balance sheet, and amplifies the effects of monetary shocks on the cost of liquidity. The model can match the level, time pattern, and cross-sectional pattern of banks’ maturity mismatch.

AB  - This chapter describes monetary policy which aims at maintaining price stability. It is not known whether the great stability will continue, as it has for more than a decade now. In part, it depends upon whether our framework of inflation targeting can respond to the economic shocks that will undoubtedly be visited upon us in the years ahead. It examines what inflation targeting really means, why it has been successful in Britain and elsewhere, and what challenges it faces in the years ahead. The source of monetary policy's influence over output and employment lies in frictions, which mean that prices and wages do not adjust instantaneously to clear markets whenever demand and supply are out of balance. Monetary policy rules have become a major area of research.

AB  - We use a cointegrated structural vector autoregressive model to investigate the relation between monetary policy in the euro area and the stock market. Since there may be an instantaneous causal relation, we consider long-run identifying restrictions for the structural shocks and also used (conditional) heteroscedasticity in the residuals for identification purposes. Heteroscedasticity is modelled by a Markov-switching mechanism. We find a plausible identification scheme for stock market and monetary policy shocks which is consistent with the second-order moment structure of the variables. The model indicates that contractionary monetary policy shocks lead to a long-lasting downturn of real stock prices.

AB  - We investigate how the monetary policy uncertainty (MPU) affects China's regional housing prices. We extend the empirical literature on the relationship between MPU and housing prices by incorporating both time-varying features and core-periphery city network structures. Using the housing returns of 70 major cities from 2007 to 2020 and a newspaper-based MPU index for China, we find that the dynamics of spatial interdependence are negatively correlated with MPU, but the total effects of MPU on housing prices are divergent across different cities. Moreover, speculators tend to purchase houses in dominant (non-dominant) cities as MPU decreases (increases), leading to the so-called “flight-to-safety” effects. Our findings can be accounted for by cities' outstanding loan balance and unemployment rates. We highlight the role of MPU in determining regional housing prices, and call for regulating dominant cities when MPU level is high.

AB  - We investigate the eﬀects of unconventional monetary policy in the euro area and the individual countries of the euro area. We ﬁnd that unconventional policy shocks have relatively small eﬀects on output and inﬂation. At the country level, the responses diﬀer across countries. Those diﬀerences correlate with the response of variables measuring ﬁnancial market stress, the volume of trade in goods to non-euro countries and health of the banking sector in each country: monetary expansions have larger eﬀects in countries where monetary expansions reduce market stress the most, where they trade more outside the euro area and in countries with healthier banks.

AB  - We will investigate the effects of an unanticipated contractionary monetary policy shock on output in South Africa. Certain economic theories suggest that only an unexpected monetary policy response has real impact, and could magnify the impact of systematic response. In this context, a change in monetary policy that comes as no surprise to private economic agents (such as investors, firms and consumers) would not change their expectations and would exert little, if any, effect on output. However, a policy change that has not been anticipated and that is expected to be long-term influences the expectations of future interest rates and economic activities such as investment and the stock market, which influence the future output (Blanchard 2006).

We contrast incomplete theories whose inputs are budget-feasible sequences of government-issued bonds and money with complete theories whose inputs are bond/money strategies described as sequences of functions that map time t histories into time t government actions. We cite historical episodes that confirm the theoretical insight that lines of authority between a Treasury and a central bank can be ambiguous, obscure, and fragile.

AB  - We describe two examples which illustrate in different ways how money and credit may be useful in the conduct of monetary policy. Our first example shows how monitoring money and credit can help anchor private sector expectations about inflation. Our second example shows that a monetary policy that focuses too narrowly on inflation may inadvertently contribute to welfare-reducing boom-bust cycles in real and financial variables. The example is of some interest because it is based on a monetary policy rule fit to aggregate data. We show that a policy of monetary tightening when credit growth is strong can mitigate the problems identified in our second example.

There are common roots in the non-neutrality results obtained in such apparently different contexts as, for example, an inflation-averse union playing against the government; a union sharing some other common objective with a policymaker; and when more than one union interacts with monopolistic competitors in the goods market and a policymaker.

T2  - Journal of Monetary Economics
AB  - This paper investigates the effects of introducing the following two alterations into a multimarket, partial information, rational expectations model; (1) individuals in any market may sample currently more prices than just the current price on their own market; (2) they choose the amount of their current information so as to minimize the sum of the costs of getting information and of being off their full information demand and supply curves. Under those circumstances any change in the variance of aggregate excess demand shocks (whether caused by real or monetary elements) affects the equilibrium level of information in the economy, in addition to its other direct effects previously recognized in the literature. Among the issues dealt with are the implications of these alterations for the following: (1) the Lucas hypothesis on the slope of the Phillips curve; (2) the optimal monetary variance and the optimal money feedback rule; (3) the effect of the level of information and of aggregate variance on the distribution of relative prices and related issues.

AB  - This paper argues that De Long’s (2000) announcement of “the triumph of monetarism” is misplaced on the grounds that the cornerstone of monetarism–the quantity theory of money–is no longer used by central banks in practice. Instead, modern monetary policy is based on maintaining aggregate demand growth that is compatible with supply-side capacity growth, a framework that can be traced to chapter 21 of Keynes’s (1936) General Theory. This paper discusses the implications for future monetary policy research, paying particular attention to how the “output gap” should be interpreted in explaining inflationary trends.

AB  - Researchers have used macroeconomic models to assess the monetary transmission process. Employing a Dynamic Stochastic General Equilibrium model, the study shows that a monetary policy shock in the form of an unanticipated rise in the interest rate causes real output and inflation to fall. The results are consistent with those obtained from other two New Keynesian models used to check the robustness of the findings. As regards the degree of inflation and output persistence, the benchmark model shows low level of inflation persistence but no output persistence under all monetary rules. The other two models show some degree of output and inflation persistence for all the three monetary rules. Finally, it looks as if the choice of monetary policy rule determines the degree of output and inflation persistence.Keywords: monetary policy shock; dynamic stochastic general equilibrium; New Keynesian models; inflation and output persistence.

AB  - Comparing Monetary Policy Transmission across European Countries. — This paper re-evaluates the estimation of monetary policy transmission. Within the Structural VAR framework, five methodological points are identified, recognition of which can help to improve the reliability and credibility of estimates. The findings of the methodological analysis are applied to the estimation of models for thirteen European countries. Results show that considerable differences in the transmission mechanism exist between these economies, mainly in intensity, but also in timing.

AB  - The “irrational exuberance” of the stock market in the late 1990s led to a discussion of the appropriate policy response by monetary authorities. Any response would be contingent on the stock market reaction to policy shocks. In this study, I employ a structural vector autoregression to estimate the response of the stock market returns to innovations in the federal funds rate. The role of the stock market in the Federal Reserve policy rule can also be examined empirically.

AB  - We consider the open economy consequences of U.S. monetary policy, extending the identification approach of Romer and Romer (2004) and adapting it for use with asset prices. Intended policy changes are orthogonalized against the economy’s expected future path, which captures any effects from open economy variables. Estimated from a set of bilateral VARs, the dynamic responses of the exchange rate, foreign interest rate, and foreign output are consistent with recent work that identifies U.S. policy via futures market changes and a priori impulse response bounds. We compare the two approaches, finding important commonalities. We also outline some advantages of our approach.

TI  - Monetary Policy in the 2008-2009 Recession
AU  - Hetzel, Robert L.
AB  - The recession that began with a cyclical peak in December 2007 originated in a combination of real shocks because of a fall in housing wealth and a fall in real income from an increase in energy prices. The most common explanation for the intensification of the recession that began in the late summer of 2008 is the propagation of these shocks through dysfunction in credit markets. The alternative explanation offered in this article emphasizes propagation through contractionary monetary policy. The first explanation stresses the importance of credit-market interventions (credit policy). The second emphasizes the importance of money creation (money-creation policy). According to Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) Chairman William McChesney Martin, "The System should always be engaged in a ruthless examination of its past record" (FOMC Minutes, 11/26/68, 1,456).
