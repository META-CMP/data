AB  - This paper examines the dynamic linkages between the federal funds rate and the stock market during the 1970–2004 period using the VAR methodology. We detected a disconnection between Fed actions and market responses in the 1990s relative to the 1970s and 1980s. Upon further analyses, we observed asymmetric effects of monetary policy actions on the stock market and that such actions were more turbulent during bear markets than bull markets. Overall, our results appear to suggest that there was consistent dynamic relationship between the conduct of monetary policy and the corresponding behavior by the stock market during the last three decades.

AB  - Dollarization - the holding by residents of a substantial portion of their assets in foreign-currency-denominated assets- is a common feature of developing and transition economies, and therefore typical of many countries with IMF - supported adjustment programs. This paper analyzes policy issues that arise-and various monetary strategies that may be pursued- when the monetary sector is dollarized, and it considers the implications that dollarization has for the design of IMF programs.

T2  - The African Economic and Business Review
AB  - The relative effectiveness of monetary and fiscal policy on economic activity
in Nigeria was determined through cointegration and error correction
modeling techniques. The time series properties of the variables were
investigated by conducting a unit root test using annual series data for the
period 1970-1998 and the data source was mainly CBN Statistical Bulletin.
The result of our analysis shows that monetary rather than fiscal policy exerts
a great impact on economic activity in Nigeria. The emphasis on fiscal action
of the government has led to greater distortion in the Nigerian economy. We
are, however, of the opinion that both monetary and fiscal policies should be
complementary.

AB  - Despite the long history of the dispute, choices do not have to be made between rules and discretion but between rules that are less rather than more complicated, and more rather than less open to scrutiny and evaluation. Steady increases in the quantity of money will produce more desirable economic consequences than will variable increases, and changes in the stock of money are more reliable indicators of monetary policy than are changes in interest rates. Indeed, major errors in monetary policy stem from using interest rates as an indicator of monetary policy.

TI  - The Murky Future of Monetary Policy
AU  - Levy, Mickey D.
AU  - Plosser, Charles I.
AB  - In August 2020, the Federal Reserve unveiled its new strategic framework. One major objective of the Fed was to address its concerns over the potential consequences for the conduct of monetary policy when the policy rate was constrained by its effective lower bound. This article concludes that there are significant flaws in the new strategy and that it encourages a more discretionary approach to monetary policy and increases the risks of policy errors. The new framework is an overly complex and asymmetric flexible average inflation targeting scheme that introduces a significant inflationary bias into policy and expands the scope for discretion by broadening the Fed's employment mandate to "maximum inclusive employment." In a postscript, the article describes how quickly the flaws have been revealed and urges a reset toward a more systematic and coherent strategy that is transparent and broadly understood by the public.

AB  - Turkey experienced a financial crisis in 2000–2001, which led to significant financial reforms. The reforms resulted in a switch to a floating exchange rate, granted greater central bank independence and pursuit of a more credible monetary policy. Investigation of the channels of monetary policy in both periods finds that monetary policy's output effects have been strengthened considerably by the reforms. In the pre-crisis period, monetary policy was highly inflationary, while in the post-crisis period, monetary policy targets low inflation and has become a tool for output stabilization. These results support the importance of central bank independence and a credible policy.

AB  - We study the macroeconomic effects of the COVID-19 epidemic in a quantitative dynamic general equilibrium setup with nominal rigidities. We evaluate various containment policies and show that they allow to dramatically reduce the welfare cost of the disease. Then we investigate the role that monetary policy, in its capacity to manage aggregate demand, should play during the epidemic. According to our results, treating the observed output contraction as a standard recession leads to overly expansionary policy. Finally, we check how central banks should resolve the trade-off between stabilizing the economy and containing the epidemic. If no administrative restrictions are in place, the second motive prevails and, despite the deep recession, optimal monetary policy is in fact contractionary. Conversely, if sufficient containment measures are introduced, central bank interventions should be expansionary and help stabilize economic activity.

AB  - This paper considers the validity of the Lucas-Sargent Proposition, which concerns the ineffectiveness of countercyclical monetary policy when expectations are rational, under the assumption that prices are "sticky." The model of Sargent and Wallace is modified so as to incorporate stickiness as follows: in each period the price adjusts to the market-clearing value only if the latter is far from the expected value (i.e., when the cost of maintaining an inappropriate price exceeds the lump-sum cost of a revision). Otherwise the price equals the value previously expected. Given this modification, the proposition remains valid.

AU  - Abu, John
AB  - This study examined the efficacy of monetary policy in curbing inflation in Nigeria. Time series data between 1986 and 2015 were used and the Vector Error Correction Model was employed to give empirical content to the stated objectives. The study found out that monetary policy is significant in curbing inflation threshold in Nigeria, however the effect of monetary policy variables are weak in controlling inflation. This is as a result of the large proportion of informal sector which culminates into a high currency outside bank economy that is largely not affected by monetary policy tools. Also, non-popularity of monetary policy tools as a result of financial illiteracy accounts for its ineffectiveness. The Monetary Policy Rate (MPR) is not statistically significant which has also affected its transmission mechanism to commercial banks interest rate. This is as a result of commercial banks' excess reserves which downplay the efficacy of the MPR in affecting interest rate and money supply. The study recommends amongst others that; first, the CBN should narrow the asymmetric corridor around the MPR to check commercial banks excess reserves. Required cash ratio and liquidity ratios should be adjusted regularly to curtail banks excess reserves; second, the CBN should embark on enlightenment campaigns in financial literacy to buttress popularity of monetary policy tools. Finally, commercial banks should expand their coverage to reduce the number of un-banked and under banked persons in the economy in order to reduce the dominance of the informal sector.

T2  - Journal of Money, Credit and Banking
AB  - We analyze optimal monetary policy in a small open economy characterized by home bias in consumption. Peculiar to our framework is the application of a Ramsey-type analysis to a model of the recent open-economy New Keynesian literature. We show that home bias in consumption is a sufficient condition for inducing the monetary policymaker of an open economy to deviate from a strategy of strict markup stabilization and contemplate some (optimal) degree of exchange rate stabilization. We focus on the optimal setting of policy both in the case of firms setting prices one period in advance and in a gradual fashion subject to adjustment costs. While the first setup allows us to analytically highlight home bias as an independent source of equilibrium markup variability, the second setup allows to study the effects of future expectations on the optimal policy problem and the effect of home bias on optimal inflation volatility. The latter, in particular, is shown to be related to the degree of trade openness in a U-shaped fashion, whereas exchange rate volatility is monotonically decreasing in openness.

TI  - Monetary policy without money: Hamlet without the Ghost
AU  - Laidler, David
AB  - Today' standard model of monetary policy has aggregate demand responding directly to an interest rate under the central bank's control, and ignores the role played by the quantity of money in the transmission mechanism. Even though monetary policy is usually aimed at controlling price level behaviour, and the price level is appropriately modelled as being determined by the interaction of the supply and demand for money, it is going too far to characterise this standard model as Hamlet without the prince. Canadian experience shows that the current framework has worked too well, and its predecessor, based on money growth targeting, worked too badly for this to be fair. Nevertheless, inflation is a monetary phenomenon, and monetary aggregates continue to have useful leading indicator properties. These facts, among others, suggest that a theory of monetary policy which pays explicit attention to the money supply permits a coherent understanding of monetary policy issues. The neglect of money by current approaches leads to a fragmented analysis of monetary policy, just as the omission of the Ghost's demand for vengeance from a production of Hamlet would undermine the play's coherence.

AB  - The transmission mechanisms of monetary policy in a small open economy like Norway are analysed through structural VARs, with special emphasis on the interdependence between monetary policy and exchange rate movements. By imposing a long-run neutrality restriction on the real exchange rate, thereby allowing the interest rate and the exchange rate to react simultaneously to news, I find considerable interdependence between monetary policy and the exchange rate. In particular, following a contractionary monetary policy shock, the real exchange rate immediately appreciates, after which it gradually depreciates back to the baseline. The results are found to be consistent with findings from an “event study”.

TI  - Structural VAR Approach to Malaysian Monetary Policy Framework: Evidence from the Pre-and Post-Asian Crisis Periods
AU  - Raghavan, M.
AU  - Silvapulle, Param
AB  - This paper employs a structural vector autoregression (SVAR) model to investigate the monetary policy framework of a small emerging open economy -Malaysia, especially how the economy dynamically respond to money, interest rate, exchange rate and foreign shocks. We establish identification conditions to uncover the dynamic effects of monetary policy shocks on various domestic variables. Following the financial crisis in July 1997, Malaysia adopted a pegged exchange regime in September 1998. By analysing the intensity of the responses of the domestic variables to various monetary shocks, we aim to find out whether the Malaysian monetary transmission mechanism has changed in the post-crisis period. Using monthly data from January 1980 to May 2006, a nine variable SVAR model is established to study the dynamic responses of the Malaysian economy to domestic and foreign shocks. The empirical results show notable differences: in the pre-crisis period, monetary policy and exchange rate shocks significantly affect the output, price, money, interest rate and exchange rate, while, in the post-crisis period, only the money shock tends to have stronger influence on output. Moreover, the domestic monetary policy appear to be far more vulnerable to foreign shocks especially the world commodity price shock and output shock in the post-crisis than in the pre-crisis period. The findings clearly indicate that the crisis has changed the role of the monetary transmission channels in propagating various policy shocks to the real sectors of the Malaysian economy.

External habits generate an additional distortion in the economy and create new trade-offs for optimal policy, as the policy maker does not respond as aggressively to technology shocks in order to avoid exacerbating the habits externality. This can dramatically affect both the parameterization of optimal simple rules, as well as their determinacy properties. These effects are particularly strong when habits are of the deep kind.

AB  - We characterize optimal monetary policy when agents learn about endogenous asset prices. Learning leads to inefficient asset price fluctuations and distortions in consumption and investment decisions. We find that the policy-relevant natural real interest rate increases with subjective asset price beliefs. Optimal monetary policy raises interest rates when expected capital gains are high, but does not eliminate deviations of asset prices from their fundamental value. When we add investment to the model, optimal policy also “leans against the wind”. In a simple calibration of the model, a positive response to capital gains in simple interest rate rules is beneficial.

TI  - Linden Dollar and Virtual Monetary Policy
AU  - Ernstberger, Philip
AB  - Growing activity and commitment of money in Second Life motivate the analysis of its economic and monetary system. It is stated that the allocation of resources to the virtual world can increase utility. Resulting demand for virtual goods drives demand for Linden Dollars - the unit of exchange used in Second Life. Since these can be interpreted as money, the effects of monetary policy are shown, which if unanticipated are fully reflected in a change of demand for virtual goods. If money flows out of the economy, costs of maintaining the fixed currency peg arise. In a currency crises model these are weighed against costs of depreciating the currency.

T2  - The Quarterly Review of Economics and Finance
AB  - I study the economies of Colombia (floating exchange rate) and Panama (dollarized) to illustrate how the monetary policy of a large economy can export capital structure distortions to small open economies that follow different exchange rate regimes. The paper contributes to the literature on international business cycles in two ways. First, it adds to recent research that extends the Mises–Hayek business cycle theory to an international context. Second, most current research abstracts from effects on the production structures of emerging market economies when analyzing the transmission of monetary policy shocks. This paper seeks to fill this gap by studying structural effects of U.S. monetary policy on the economies of Colombia (floating exchange rate) and Panama (dollarized).

It is demonstrated that an increase in erratic monetary policy causes an increase in demand for inventories by individuals. This behavior by individuals in turn leads to a higher variability of the price level, as well as a higher price level in the steady state of the aggregate economy.

TI  - Analyses the Effect of Monetary Policy Transmission on the Inequality in OECD Countries
AU  - Farajnezhad, Mohammad
AB  - The aim of this article is to analyze the inequality impacts of monetary policy transmission in OECD countries’ economy from 2001 to 2017. Panel regression model has been applied for the hypotheses test. Information gathering has been based on the country's basic information, i.e the data required for research are generally derived from the library method, using the World Bank website. The econometric method used in this research, is Generalized Torque Method. Dependent variable Gini coefficient index is considered as an indicator of income inequality and independent variables of monetary transfer mechanisms include interest rates, liquidity, exchange rates, the gold price, the legal reserves of the central bank and the banks' debt to the central bank. The results show that the interest impact of monetary transfer mechanism at the Gini coefficient as an indifference index in OECD countries is positive and insignificant (probability is 0.18) with a coefficient of 0.004 and it shows that raising interest rates will increase the inequality in these countries. Additionally, the effect of the capital market on the inequality is also positive with a coefficient of 0.001 and a significant probability of 0.002. It shows the positive effect of bank deposits on income inequality

AU  - Dimitrijević, Bojan
AU  - Lovre, Ivan
AB  - The global economic crisis has led to the global reduction in credit activity, a fall of domestic product as well as the level of foreign direct investments, and has imposed the sources of economic growth as one of the key problems. Therefore, the objective of this paper is the monetary policy review and the task is to research the circumstances when it is possible for the money supply to become the source of economic growth without inflationary consequences. The paper analyzes the demand and supply functions for money, the quantity theory of money, velocity of circulation and instruments of monetary policy and strives to propose such a combination of measures of a new economic policy based on theoretical arguments that will stimulate economic growth. This aim requires a completely new approach to the mechanism of money creation and selection of monetary instruments, proposing the money supply connection to the growth of real GDP, the money supply control as the key instrument, and a low and stable long-term interest rate as the factor for maintaining stability of velocity. In such case, monetary policy will have a real impact on economic growth, even in the long run.

AU  - Obstfeld, Maurice
T2  - Journal of International Economics
AB  - This paper presents a long-run model of the open economy in a world of fixed exchange rates and imperfect substitutability between bonds denominated in different currencies. The model explicitly accounts for the wealth flow accompanying current-account imbalance and for the flow of interest payments associated with international lending. Both the dynamic and steady-state implications of the model are quite different from those of models that specify the capital account as a continuing flow responding to the level of interest rates. In particular, we find that when there exists outside government debt, open-market policy is not in general neutral in the long run. We also find conditions under which the central bank is able to hold the domestic price level constant in the face of an inflationary disturbance from abroad without exhausting, in the long run, its stock of domestic assets.

T2  - Journal of Macroeconomics
AB  - Price level targeting has been proposed as an alternative to inflation targeting that may confer benefits if a central bank sets policy under discretion, even if society’s loss function is specified in terms of inflation (instead of price level) volatility. This paper demonstrates the sensitivity of this argument. If even a small portion of agents use a rule-of-thumb to form inflation expectations, or does not fully understand the nature of the target, price level targeting may in fact impose costs on society rather than benefits.

AB  - This paper examines the role of monetary policy in an environment with aggregate risk and incomplete markets. In a two-period overlapping-generations model with aggregate uncertainty and nominal bonds, optimal monetary policy attains the ex-ante Pareto optimal allocation. This policy aims to stabilize the savings rate in the economy via the effect of expected inflation on real returns of nominal bonds. The equilibrium under optimal monetary policy is characterized by positive average inflation and a nonstationary price level. In an application a key finding is that optimal monetary policy combines features of inflation and price-level targeting.

AB  - This paper considers two challenges that improvements in private-sector information-processing capabilities may pose for the effectiveness of monetary policy. It first considers the consequences of improved information about central-bank actions, and argues that the management of expectations will become even more important to effective monetary policy. The paper next considers the consequences of the potential erosion of private-sector demand for central-bank money. This should not fundamentally impair the ability of central banks to achieve their stabilization objectives, though it may require a new approach to the implementation of monetary policy. The advantages of a 'channel' system, in which central-bank standing facilities are the main tool used to control overnight interest rates, are discussed.

TI  - Monetary Policy as Financial Stability Regulation*
AU  - Stein, Jeremy C.
T2  - The Quarterly Journal of Economics
AB  - This article develops a model that speaks to the goals and methods of financial stability policies. There are three main points. First, from a normative perspective, the model defines the fundamental market failure to be addressed, namely, that unregulated private money creation can lead to an externality in which intermediaries issue too much short-term debt and leave the system excessively vulnerable to costly financial crises. Second, it shows how in a simple economy where commercial banks are the only lenders, conventional monetary policy tools such as open-market operations can be used to regulate this externality, whereas in more advanced economies it may be helpful to supplement monetary policy with other measures. Third, from a positive perspective, the model provides an account of how monetary policy can influence bank lending and real activity, even in a world where prices adjust frictionlessly and there are other transactions media besides bank-created money that are outside the control of the central bank.

The data used in this study are the level of domestic prices (P), economic growth (EG), interest rates (IR), and the real exchange rate (R) with quarterly time periods in 2019-quarter 3 in 2021. This research used the Structural Vector model Autoregression (SVAR). The result shows that the contribution of monetary policy instruments varies considerably to economic variables such as economic growth, the level of domestic prices, and the real exchange rate. But, the biggest contribution of the BI rate is felt by the variable price (inflation).

T2  - Journal of Economic Dynamics and Control
AB  - Leaning-against the-wind (LAW) policies, whereby interest rates are raised in the face of a growing asset price bubble, are often advocated as a means of dampening such bubbles. On the other hand, there are theoretical arguments suggesting that such a policy could have the opposite effect (Gal í, 2014). We study the effect of monetary policy on asset price bubbles in a laboratory experiment with an overlapping generations structure. Participants in the role of the young generation allocate their endowment between two investments: a risky asset and a one-period riskless bond. The risky asset pays no dividend and thus the possibility of selling it to the next generation is its only source of value. Consequently, its price is a pure bubble. We study how variations in the interest rate affect the evolution of the bubble in an experiment with three treatments. One treatment has a fixed low interest rate, another a fixed high interest rate, and the third has a LAW interest rate policy in place. We observe that the bubble increases (decreases) when interest rates are lower (higher) in the period of a policy change. However, the opposite effect is observed in the following period, when higher (lower) interest rates are associated with greater (smaller) bubble growth. Direct measurement of expectations reveals that traders expect prices to follow previous trends and tend to correct for prior errors in their predictions.

It argues that certain deeply held beliefs underpinning those paradigms can complicate the task of regaining policy headroom.

T2  - Journal of Monetary Economics
AB  - A two-country model with monopolistic competition and price stickiness is employed to investigate the implications for macroeconomic stability and the welfare properties of three international policy arrangements: (a) cooperative, (b) non-cooperative and (c) monetary union. I characterize the conditions under which there is scope for policy cooperation and quantify the costs of non-cooperation and monetary union. The non-cooperative equilibrium may be suboptimal because of terms of trade spillover effects, while monetary union may be suboptimal because of the sluggishness of relative prices. Both the costs of policy competition and of a monetary union are sensitive to the values assumed for the intertemporal and international demand elasticity and the degree of openness of the economy. Independently of the calibration scenario adopted, the ECB has little to gain by coordinating with the Fed.

AB  - In a model of banking we give money a role in providing cheap collateral; i.e. besides the Taylor Rule, monetary policy can affect the risk-premium by varying the supply of M0 in open market operations, so that even at the zero bound monetary policy is still effective, and fiscal policy still crowds out investment. A simple rule for making M0 respond to credit conditions can substantially enhance the economy’s stability. This, in combination with Price-level or nominal GDP targeting rules for interest rates, stabilises the economy further, making aggressive and distortionary regulation of banks’ balance sheets redundant.

TI  - Optimal Monetary Policy with Vertical Production and Trade*
AU  - Shi, Kang

T2  - Review of International Economics
AB  - This paper explores the optimal monetary policy response to domestic and foreign technology shocks in an open economy with vertical structure of production and trade. We find that any stage-specific productivity shock in one country may have a transborder spillover effect on the other country via the vertical trade. So when choosing optimal monetary rules, each monetary authority should respond to both home and foreign productivity shocks. Also, the flexible exchange rate cannot replicate the flexible price equilibrium, even under producer currency pricing, due to price stickiness in multiple stages. We also find that the existence of a transborder spillover effect depends on the currencies of price setting. Finally, vertical trade may affect the value of exchange rate flexibility under PCP and LCP setting.

TI  - Dollarization, Monetary Policy, and the Pass-Through
AU  - Ize, Alain
AU  - Parrado, Eric
AB  - This paper explores how real dollarization (dollar indexing of wages), financial dollarization (dollar denomination of financial contracts), and monetary policy interact in a general equilibrium, new open-economy macroeconomics model with real shocks. Real dollarization is avoided as long as the home monetary authorities conduct monetary policy optimally (maximize local welfare). Suboptimal monetary policies are more likely to induce real dollarization when the correlation between domestic and external shocks is high, since in this case the (presumably optimal) foreign monetary policy guarantees a better level of protection against macroeconomic uncertainty. While real dollarization contributes to financial dollarization, important asymmetries between the two were found.

AB  - The objective of this paper is to evaluate the effects of monetary policy shocks on stock market indices in the G-7 countries and Spain using the methodology of structural VARs. A model is estimated for each country and the effects of monetary policy shocks are evaluated by means of impulse responses. A contractionary shock has a negative and temporary effect on stock market indices. There is evidence of a significant cross-country heterogeneity in the persistence, magnitude and timing of the responses. A limited participation model with households trading in stocks is set up and the responses of stock prices to a monetary policy shock under different rules are evaluated. The model is able to account for the empirical response of stock prices to monetary policy shocks under different policy rules.

AB  - The paper aims at deriving some stylised facts for financial, real, and monetary policy developments during asset price booms. We observe various macroeconomic variables in a pre-boom, boom and post-boom phase. Not all booms lead to large output losses. We analyse the differences between highcost and low-cost booms. High-cost booms are clearly those in which real estate prices and investment crash in the post-boom periods. In general it is difficult to distinguish a high-cost from a low-cost boom at an early stage. However, high-cost booms seem to follow very rapid growth in the real money and real credit stocks just before the boom and at the early stages of a boom. There is also evidence that high-cost booms are associated with significantly looser monetary policy conditions over the boom period, especially towards the late stage of a boom. We finally discuss the results with regard to the theoretical literature.

TI  - Nominal-Real Tradeoffs and the Effects of Monetary Policy: the Romanian Experience
AU  - Popa, Christian
AB  - Due to the persistence of relatively soft budget constraints and poor government credibility, the survival strategy of Romanian state-sector firms means eschewing profit maximization in the short run in favor of insider utility maximization.  This takes the form of attempts at both reducing layoffs and minimizing real wage losses on the background of substantial adjustment in real output.  Nominal adjustment (especially pricing and arrears) is favored over riskier and more costly real adjustment, since firms are risk-averse in the longer run.  From an operational viewpoint, the representative firm's objective becomes that of maximizing liquidity flows subject to constraints regarding labor hoarding systemic limits to debt default and spontaneous restructuring.    Empirical evidence supports the idea of an inflation-output tradeoff (in terms of variations around trends) where increases in expected inflation and/or expected gross nominal arrears have a significant negative impact on real industrial output, while unexpected inflation (and defaulted debt) exhibits positive but insignificant coefficients.  The tradeoff persists even when controlling for demand-side factors.  Monetary variables do not appear to cause this tradeoff, but rather seem to be mediating it.  Persistence is also much more pronounced in inflation than it is in real output.    Monetary policy measures then tend to have an asymmetric impact: they are likely to affect the nominal side more than the real one; monetary aggregates tend to have  a sharp short-run impact compared to the stronger and longer-lasting effects induced with a lag by changes in interest rates; required reserves, because of their lesser political visibility, have for a long period been a more effective instrument of monetary policy management compared to refinancing rates, when the central bank's independence was ambiguous.  Finally, in the context of a specific credit channel fueled both by commercial bank loans and by differential access to defaulted debt, short-term credit to the state sector exhibits adverse selection features compared to loans extended to private-sector firms, with the latter being in the position of net creditor due to the predominance of hard budget constraints.  Firm immunity (given by size, political sensitiveness of the respective industry, importance as regional employer, etc.) to punitive interventions either on the part of government authorities or creditors seems to play a large role in the proliferation of financial indiscipline as a repeated game, with large, poorly efficient firms initiating arrears growth and other firms following either voluntarily (due to cost-of-credit differences) or involuntarily (because of a liquidity squeeze).  Interestingly, arrears are not perfect substitutes for credit, while both M2 and nongovernment credit appear to accommodate increases in gross arrears.    The transmission of monetary policy via a credit channel is also interesting in the post-1996 context of central bank deposit taking meant to sterilize excess liquidity due to relatively high capital inflows.    The policy conclusions point to the limited effectiveness of monetary policy in macrostabilization of structuural reforms, privatization, financial discipline and improvements in corporate governance are absent or slow; the need for austere monetary policy in sustaining these measures; and the danger of expansionary policy aimed at growth and/or employment objectives.  Institutional reforms at the central bank level (improvements in the independece of the monetary authority, stating price stability as the paramount objective of monetary policy, instituting multi-annual inflation targets in the context of a consistent macro policy mix, etc) are also examined.

AB  - We assess the effects of increased bank competition on macroeconomic and lending dynamics and on the transmission of monetary policy. Applying panel local projections to state-level data, we, in a first step, investigate the dynamic effects of fiercer bank competition induced by deregulation allowing geographical expansion of banks across state borders in the 1980s and early-1990s. We allow for possible adjustments before the new laws became effective due to potential anticipation effects. Our findings suggest that these events were anticipated and that they temporarily increased economic activity as well as business and consumer lending. We also find a permanent increase in real estate lending and house prices. In a second step, we show that the impact of monetary policy on economic activity, house prices and lending tended to become stronger after interstate banking deregulation.

AU  - Reserve Bank of Australia
AB  - We document that the effect of monetary policy on housing prices varies substantially by local housing market. We show that this heterogeneity across local housing markets can be partly explained by variation in housing supply conditions – housing prices are typically more sensitive to changes in interest rates in areas where land is more expensive. But other factors are important too. Specifically, we find the sensitivity is greater in areas where incomes are relatively high, households are more indebted and there are more investors. Taken together, this suggests that the state of the economy can affect the sensitivity of housing prices to monetary policy. We also directly explore how monetary policy affects housing wealth inequality. We find that housing prices in more expensive areas are more sensitive to changes in interest rates than in cheaper areas. This suggests that lower interest rates increase housing wealth inequality, while higher rates do the opposite. However, these effects appear to be temporary.

AB  - This paper considers whether the development of ‘electronic money’ poses any threat to the ability of central banks to control the value of their national currencies through conventional monetary policy. It argues that, even if the demand for base money for use in facilitating transactions is largely or even completely eliminated, monetary policy should continue to be effective. Macroeconomic stabilization depends only upon the ability of central banks to control a short-term nominal interest rate, and this would continue to be possible, in particular through the use of a ‘channel’ system for the implementation of policy, like those currently used in Canada, Australia and New Zealand.

AB  - The monetary policy today has literally become interest rate policy. The central banks decide the short-term interest rate to achieve their objectives. The monetary policy is conducted without considering any socioeconomic and ethical implication of its use. However, in reality, the monetary policy has several socioeconomic, moral, and ethical implications. For example, the conduct of monetary policy is based on the assumption of demand channel of monetary transmission mechanism. This channel assumes that by increasing the interest rate, the aggregate demand in the economy could be reduced which will put downward pressure on the aggregate price level. Suppose the demand channel works and the aggregate demand could be reduced by increasing interest rate, it is quite clear that such a reduction in demand can occur mainly due to luxuries, and, therefore, the price of luxuries shall reduce. The consumption of necessities could not be reduced reasonably by the change in interest rate; therefore the prices of necessities are also unlikely to reduce, and the monetary intervention would increase real income of consumer of luxuries relative to those having necessities in their consumption basket, leading to a redistribution of real income which favors privileged class of society. There are many other ways in which the monetary policy can affect the socioeconomic variables. This chapter summarizes number of logical flaws and socioeconomic consequences of the monetary policy which show that monetary policy should not be conducted without analyzing its socioeconomic consequences.

AB  - We develop flexible semiparametric time series methods for the estimation of the causal effect of monetary policy on macroeconomic aggregates. Our estimator captures the average causal response to discrete policy interventions in a macrodynamic setting, without the need for assumptions about the process generating macroeconomic outcomes. The proposed estimation strategy, based on propensity score weighting, easily accommodates asymmetric and nonlinear responses. Using this estimator, we show that monetary tightening has clear effects on the yield curve and on economic activity. Monetary accommodation, however, appears to generate less pronounced responses from both. Estimates for recent financial crisis years display a similarly dampened response to monetary accommodation.

TI  - Customer Anger at Price Increases, Time Variation in the Frequency of Price Changes and Monetary Policy
AU  - Rotemberg, Julio J.
AB  - While much evidence suggests tha price rigidity is due to a concern with the reaction of customers, price increases do not seem to be typically associated with drastic reduction in purchases. To explain this apparent inconsistency, this paper develops a model where consumers care about the fairness of prices and react negatively only when they become convinced that prices are unfair. This leads to price rigidity, though the implications of the model are not identical to those of existing models of costly price adjustment. In particular, the frequency of price adjustment ought to depend on economy-wide variables observed by consumers. As I show, this has implications for the effects of monetary policy. It can, in particular, explain why inflation does not fall immediately after a monetary tightening.

AB  - A monetary policy reaction function is estimated, allowing for several possible patterns of time variation in both its coefﬁcients and its disturbance variances. A clear improvement in ﬁt over a ﬁxed-parameter linear model is found. The strongest effect on likelihood is from time variation in variances, but there are also improvements in ﬁt from allowing coefﬁcient variation. The variation is estimated as evolving in a stochastic, repeating pattern, not as evolution from one style of policy at mid-century and a new style in the 90’s. The “regime shifts” that are estimated to occur do not last very long, and appear to reﬂect temporary shifts in the level of policy activism, not systematic improvement.

AU  - Taylor, John B.
T2  - Journal of Applied Econometrics
AB  - Estimates of the effect of different international monetary regimes on the parameters of the Phillips curve, the Keynesian consumption function, and other reduced-form macroeconomic relationships are given. The estimates provide a quantitative assessment of the importance of the Lucas critique for such regime shifts. The estimates are calculated by stochastically simulating an estimated multicountry economic model with rational expectations under a fixed exchange rate regime and a flexible exchange rate regime. In both regimes interest rates are the primary instrument of monetary policy. Noticeable shifts occur in most of the macroeconomic relationships, especially in the consumption function and the Phillips curve, and these shifts have simple economic interpretations based on the changes in the variance and the serial correlation of income and prices in the two regimes. However, in most cases the shifts are not large quantitatively. At least, as implemented here, this type of regime shift does not seem to generate much instability in the conventional macroeconomic relationships. Several possible reasons for this finding are discussed in the paper.

AB  - A recent paper by Bernanke, Gertler, and Watson (1997) suggests that monetary policy could be used to eliminate any recessionary consequences of an oil price shock. This paper challenges this conclusion on two grounds. First, we question whether the Federal Reserve actually has the power to implement such a policy; for example, we consider it unlikely that additional money creation would have succeeded in reducing the Fed funds rate by 900 basis points relative to the values seen in 1974. Second, we point out that the size of the effect that Bernanke, Gertler, and Watson attribute to oil shocks is substantially smaller than that reported by other researchers, primarily due to their choice of a shorter lag length than that used by other researchers. We offer evidence in favor of the longer lag length employed by previous research and show that under this specification, even the aggressive Federal Reserve policies proposed would not have succeeded in averting a downturn.

AU  - Folkerts-Landau, David
AU  - Garber, Peter M.
AB  - A European central banking institution will be an essential feature of the final stage of the European Economic and Monetary Union. The EC Committee of Central Bank Governors has recently produced a Draft Statute of the European System of Central Banks and of the European Central Bank. The draft Statute mandates the maintenance of price stability as the explicit primary objective of the ECB. and the necessary monetary functions and operations of the system are defined in accordance with standard practice. The maintenance of a stable financial and payments system, however. is not an explicit objective of the ECB. and only limited banking functions are admitted as one of the system's tasks. The draft Statute clearly subscribes to a "narrow" concept of the System of Central Banks with a single objective-monetary stability-rather than a "broad" concept with the additional objective of financial-market stability. In this paper we examine the consequences of a "narrow" central banking system for Community financial markets, We conclude that in the absence of such banking functions it will be necessary to slow or even prevent the ongoing development of Community-wide liquid. securitized financial markets, supported by a large-volume wholesale payments system. Instead, the historically prevalent bank-intermediated financial system will have to be maintained to lower the likelihood of liquidity crises that demand central bank intervention.

AB  - This study examines the efficacy of monetary policy in achieving Balance of Payments stability in Nigeria. One of the stabilization policies with which the government of Nigeria manages the economy is that of Monetary Policy. Monetary Policy formulation in Nigeria is usually targeted at achieving some macro-economic objectives amongst which is equilibrium in the country’s Balance of Payments (BOP). The general objective of this research was to examine the relationship between the Balance of Payments position in Nigeria and monetary policy adopted in the country. The research was conducted using an Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) technique of multiple regression models using statistical time series data from 1980-2010. The estimated result shows a positive relationship between the dependent variable (Balance of Payments) and the Independent variables (Money Supply, Exchange Rate and Interest Rate). Specifically, Money Supply and Interest Rate had significant relationship with Balance of Payments, whereas Exchange Rate was not statistically significant. Based on the results, it was therefore recommended that the government should promote the exportation of Nigerian products especially the Non oil products, as this will bring in more foreign exchange into the country, boost productive activities and improve the balance of payments position of the country. Also, the Central Bank of Nigeria should ensure that the monetary policies adopted in the country are complemented with effective fiscal policies to foster economic growth and development in the Nigerian economy.

TI  - Asymmetric Effect of Monetary Policy in Emerging Countries: The Case of Egypt
AU  - Abdelsalam, Mamdouh
T2  - Applied Economics and Finance
AB  - The aim of this study is to explore the asymmetric effect of the unanticipated monetary policy shocks on inflation and real production. This is done by utilizing the non-linear autoregressive distributed lag (ARDL) model. Nonlinear ARDL allows us to check for the asymmetric effect of the policy in terms of the size of the shocks: large or small, and the stance of the shocks: loose or tight. Additionally, Wald test is employed to confirm the underlying relationship. The results provided a sufficient evidence for the idea of the asymmetric effect of monetary policy in Egypt. Firstly, regarding the size of the policy, only small shocks have a considerable effect on both inflation and real production. Secondly, regarding the direction of the policy, only positive shocks have a considerable influence on both variables. Wald test confirmed the abovementioned results. Therefore, based on these results, the monetary policy in Egypt is only effective under some circumstances and thus other economic policies such as fiscal policy might be more effective in these cases.

T2  - Review of Radical Political Economics
AB  - Prior research suggests that the Fed has consistently targeted unemployment rates, and, during the 1990s, stock prices. This paper uses a vector autoregression to test the importance of unemployment and the stock market in determining monetary policy, and to study the impact of monetary policy on unemployment and the stock market. The results show a shift in both the determinants and the impact of monetary policy in the 1990s from unemployment to the stock market.

AU  - Johnson, Mr Omotunde E. G.
AB  - Achieving the primary objective of price stability without unduly compromising the operational efficiency of the payment system constitutes a major problem for central banks. Routine monetary policy presumes a given institutional and technological framework, including aspects of the payment system. Such a monetary policy concerns itself with intraday and interday credit for payments settlements and with float. Liquidity shocks and panics sometimes pose an additional challenge. In recent years, major and rapid institutional and technological changes in the payment system (mainly to lower risks and augment operational efficiency) have affected the monetary policy decision-making process, particularly in the short run.

AU  - Castillo, Paul
AU  - Montoro, Carlos
AB  - This paper extends a simple dynamic general equilibrium neokeynesian model consider-ing preferences that exhibit intertemporal and intratemporal non-homotheticity. We show that when introducing non-homotheticity we can calibrate the model to generate asymmet-ric responses in output and ination to monetary policy shocks similar to those observed in the data. Moreover, we are able to generate asymmetric responses that are associated both to a convex supply curve and to asymmetric shifts in aggregate demand, extending the existent literature that only considers one type of asymmetry at the time. Furthermore, we show that linear approximation solutions of dynamic general equilibrium models are not only inaccurate to measure welfare, but also to account for the dynamics of the model when preferences are non-homothetic. The paper also extends the literature on the impli-cations of non-linearity, asymmetry, for optimal monetary policy rules. In particular we show that when non-linear behaviour is important to explain the dynamics of the model, optimal policy rules may also be non-linear.

TI  - Monetary Policy and Stock Market Returns: Evidence from Nigeria
AU  - Okpara, Godwin Chigozie
T2  - Journal of Economics
AB  - To analyze the effect of monetary policy on the Nigerian stock market returns, we employed the Two Stage Least Squared Method on a set of simultaneous equations which were found to be over identified. The reduced form equation was tested for stationarity using the Augmented Dickey Fuller Unit Root Test and Cointegration Test. A Vector Error Correction Model and the Forecast Error Decomposition Analysis were also used to determine the long and short run dynamic properties of the equations. Our major findings are that, monetary policy is a significant determinant of long-run stock market returns in Nigeria. Specifically, high Treasury bill rate reduces stock market returns and thus, shows an evidence of monetary policy efforts to slow down the economy. While current and one period lag interest rate exert a positive and significant influence on the stock market returns. The lagged error correction term is negatively signed, suggesting that about 32 percent of deviation from the long-run equilibrium between stock returns and the Treasury bill rate cum interest rate is corrected periodically. Also the salient feature of the variance decomposition results is that the predominant sources of returns fluctuations are due largely to stock returns shocks and interest rate shocks. Thus the innovations of rate of interest can be a better predictor of stock market returns in Nigeria.

T2  - Brookings Papers on Economic Activity
AB  - Constraints on the setting of short-term interest rates due to the effective lower bound are likely to bind more often in the future than in the past if the neutral real rate of interest remains in the neighborhood of 1 percent. This paper argues that the Federal Open Market Committee should commit to pursuing a “lower-for-longer” or “makeup” strategy for setting short-term rates when the zero bound binds. This strategy is consistent with the goal of targeting 2 percent inflation, on average, over the business cycle. A “lower-for-longer” approach would improve economic performance during zero-lower-bound episodes and avoid an erosion of inflation expectations.

AB  - Monetary policy-makers' beliefs about how the economy functions are a key determinant of the conduct of policy. That monetary policy has little impact under the prevailing circumstances is a belief which has resurfaced periodically over the Federal Reserve's 100-year history. In both the 1930s and the 1970s a belief in the ineffectiveness of monetary policy led to policy inaction and poor economic outcomes. For some of the recent period, the same view appears to have limited the policy response to prolonged high unemployment in the presence of low inflation.

AB  - The idea of monetary policy aimed at producing a stable price level has gained increasing support in the United States in recent years. In 1991, the Neal Resolution proposed to make such a policy objective law. Elsewhere, the notion of price stability has also become more popular. For example, the central banks of Canada and New Zealand recently adopted explicit multiyear targets for inflation, and a commitment to price stability is widely thought to be a necessary condition for successful monetary union in the European Community.

AB  - Monetary policy is one of the instruments that policymakers use to provide both sustainable economic growth and price stability. In this study, I analyse the stock market transmission channel of the monetary policy of the Turkish economy not only at the aggregate but also at the sectoral level in a structural vector autoregression (SVAR) framework. I adopt alternative variables as a policy instrument. When the spread is used as a policy instrument, I find that contractionary monetary policy has a significant negative effect on both output and the price level, and it appreciates the Turkish Lira. Besides, the tight monetary policy reduces both aggregate and sectoral market returns. Hence, I observe that there are effective interest rate, exchange rate, and asset price channels in the Turkish economy.

T2  - Review of Economic Dynamics

AB  - A liquidity-insurance motive for monetary policy operates when heterogeneous households use government-provided liquidity (“money”) to insure idiosyncratic risk. In our tractable sticky-price model this changes the central bank's trade-off by adding a linear benefit of insurance in the second-order approximation to aggregate welfare. Inflation volatility hinders the consumption volatility of constrained households as a side-effect of liquidity-insuring them; but price stability has quantitatively significant welfare costs only when monopolistic rents are also large, which indicates a complementarity between imperfect-insurance and New-Keynesian distortions. Helicopter drops are welfare-superior to open-market operations to achieve insurance, but quantitatively their benefit is surprisingly small.

TI  - Effects of Monetary Policy on the US Dollar/UK Pound Exchange Rate. Is There a “Delayed Overshooting Puzzle”?
AU  - Heinlein, Reinhold
AU  - Krolzig, Hans-Martin
T2  - Review of International Economics
AB  - The determination of the US dollar/UK pound sterling exchange rate is studied in a small symmetric macroeconometric model including UK–US differentials in inflation, output gap, and short- and long-term interest rates for the four decades since the breakdown of Bretton Woods. The key question addressed is the possible presence of a “delayed overshooting puzzle” in the dynamic reaction of the exchange rate to monetary policy shocks. In contrast to the existing literature, we follow a data-driven modeling approach combining (i) a vector autoregression (VAR)-based cointegration analysis with (ii) a graph-theoretic search for instantaneous causal relations and (iii) an automatic general-to-specific approach for the selection of a congruent parsimonious structural vector equilibrium correction model. We find that the long-run properties of the system are characterized by four cointegration relations and one stochastic trend, which is identified as the long-term interest rate differential and that appears to be driven by long-term inflation expectations as in the Fisher hypothesis. It cointegrates with the inflation differential to a stationary “real” long-term rate differential and also drives the exchange rate. The short-run dynamics are characterized by a direct link from the short-term to the long-term interest rate differential. Jumps in the exchange rate after short-term interest rate variations are only significant at 10%. Overall, we find strong evidence for delayed overshooting and violations of uncovered interest rate parity (UIP) in response to monetary policy shocks.

AB  - This chapter reviews recent research that grapples with the question: What happens after an exogenous shock to monetary policy? We argue that this question is interesting because it lies at the center of a particular approach to assessing the empirical plausibility of structural economic models that can be used to think about systematic changes in monetary policy institutions and rules. The literature has not yet converged on a particular set of assumptions for identifying the effects of an exogenous shock to monetary policy. Nevertheless, there is considerable agreement about the qualitative effects of a monetary policy shock in the sense that inference is robust across a large subset of the identification schemes that have been considered in the literature. We document the nature of this agreement as it pertains to key economic aggregates.

T2  - Economic Notes
AB  - This paper tests empirically the linkage between banks' investment and interbank lending decisions in response to interest rate changes. We draw conclusions for the monetary policy, which uses the interest rate as its main tool. Across European countries we find that the risk-free (i.e. monetary policy) interest rate negatively affects the liquidity retained by banks and the decision of a bank to be a lender in the interbank market. Instead, the interbank interest rate has a positive impact on these decisions. We also find that banks who lend show less risk-taking behaviour and tend to be smaller than those who are borrowers. Most importantly, the risk-free interest rate is positively correlated with loans investment and bank risk-taking behaviour.

TI  - Targeting inflation: The effects of monetary policy on the CPI and its housing component
AU  - Papadimitriou, Dimitri B.
AU  - Wray, L. Randall
AB  - The targets for monetary policy adopted by the Fed in recent years have not proven to be closely correlated with inflation, leading some theorists and policymakers to advocate the use of a price index, such as the consumer price index (CPI), as both the target and the goal of monetary policy. The authors of this brief show that such a choice is not wise because the CPI does not accurately reflect market-caused price increases and is not under the control of monetary policy. Their analysis extends beyond that of recent reports to show how and why the transmission mechanisms through which monetary policy is thought to affect the CPI are tenuous at best. The authors focus on the housing component of the CPI to illustrate their point. They conclude that those components of the CPI that monetary policy is likely to affect have been declining in importance, meaning that to produce a given reduction in the overall rate of inflation will require that monetary policy have an increasingly larger impact on an ever-diminishing portion of the consumer basket. Therefore, careful reconsideration of an alternative ultimate target, such as the rate of economic growth or the unemployment rate, is warranted.

TI  - The effect of monetary policy on real estate price growth in China
AU  - Xu, Xiaoqing Eleanor

T2  - Pacific-Basin Finance Journal
AB  - Using quarterly data from 1998:Q1 to 2009:Q4 and monthly data from July 2005 to February 2010, this paper examines the impact of key monetary policy variables, including long-term benchmark bank loan rate, money supply growth, and mortgage credit policy indicator, on the real estate price growth dynamics in China. Empirical results consistently demonstrate that expansionary monetary policy tends to accelerate the subsequent home price growth, while restrictive monetary policy tends to decelerate the subsequent home price growth. These results suggest that Chinese monetary policy actions are the key driving forces behind the change of real estate price growth in China. We also show that hot money flow does not have a significant impact on the change of home price growth after controlling for the money supply growth. Finally, a bullish stock market tends to accelerate subsequent home price growth.

TI  - Monetary Policy Performance under Control of exchange rate and consumer price index
AU  - Jamil, Muhammad Naveed
T2  - Journal of Environmental Science and Economics
AB  - Central Reserve announced the Monetary Policy Rate from 1955 to 2021 in different ways, and the central bank should be equally interested in the output of exchange rate and price stability. Besides having a stabilizing effect on the price level and trend of exchange rate stabilized the countries outputs. We find that monetary policy control; the price level does not affect production and exchange rate. Monetary policy is the only thing that can change the trend of exchange rate and Consumer Price Index. The actual policy was fixed exchange rate, and currency devaluations like Japan were quite successful for stability. The results indicate that the central bank can stabilize much of the macroeconomic indicators and disturbances under a monetary exchange rate and consumer price index system.

AB  - The VIX, the stock market option-based implied volatility, strongly co-moves with measures of the monetary policy stance. When decomposing the VIX into two components, a proxy for risk aversion and expected stock market volatility (“uncertainty”), we find that a lax monetary policy decreases both risk aversion and uncertainty, with the former effect being stronger. The result holds in a structural vector autoregressive framework, controlling for business cycle movements and using a variety of identification schemes for the vector autoregression in general and monetary policy shocks in particular. The effect of monetary policy on risk aversion is also apparent in regressions using high frequency data.

TI  - Measuring the Effects of Monetary Policy Innovations in Nigeria: A Structural Vector Autoregressive (SVAR) Approach
AU  - Chuku, C. A.
AB  - Correctly identifying the effects of monetary policy innovations is necessary for good policy making. In this paper, we carry out a controlled experiment using a structural vector autoregression (SVAR) model to trace the effects of monetary policy shocks on output and prices in Nigeria. We make the assumption that the Central Bank cannot observe unexpected changes in output and prices within the same period. This places a recursive restriction on the disturbances of the SVAR. We conduct the experiment using three alternative policy instruments i.e. broad money (M2), Minimum Rediscount Rate (MRR) and the real effective exchange rate (REER). Overall, we find evidence that monetary policy innovations carried out on the quantity-based nominal anchor (M2) has modest effects on output and prices with a very fast speed of adjustment. While, innovations on the price-based nominal anchors (MRR and REER) have neutral and fleeting effects on output. We conclude that the manipulation of the quantity of money (M2) in the economy is the most influential instrument for monetary policy implementation. Hence, we recommend that central bankers should place more emphasis on the use of the quantity-based nominal anchor rather than the price-based nominal anchors.

TI  - VAR-Ing Monetary Policy in Poland
AU  - Maliszewski, Wojciech S.
AB  - The paper makes an attempt to estimate the effects of monetary policy shocks on the economy. We estimate four variables VAR system with industrial production, CPI, money market rate and exchange rate. Two policy indicators: money market interest rate and exchange rate are assumed to be contemporaneously influenced by monetary policy shocks. The identification of the shocks is obtained by assigning weights to these two variables in the short run monetary condition index. The response functions generated by the small VAR system have reasonable shapes and economic interpretations: monetary policy shock seems to affect inflation and output relatively quickly. Granger causality tests reveals that although money market rate has limited predictive power in forecasting industrial production and CPI, the predictive power of exchange rate is very significant for the CPI. Decomposition of variance of the forecasted variables is consistent with these results: monetary policy shocks have significant contribution to the forecast variance of CPI.
