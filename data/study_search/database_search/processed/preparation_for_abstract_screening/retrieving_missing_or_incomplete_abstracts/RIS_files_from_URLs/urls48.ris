AB  - This study investigated the effect of monetary policy development on equity prices in the Nigerian Stock Exchange Market using annual data from 1985 to 2010. The ordinary least square regression (OLS) was run using five monetary policy variables including minimum rediscount rate, treasury bill rate, interest rate, exchange rate and consumer price index (proxy for inflation) on the equity prices (proxied by all share price index). The first investigation of this study is that minimum rediscount rates and Treasury bill rates are highly correlated and cannot be applied simultaneously in monetary policy management. As a consequence, the Treasury bill rates were dropped in the course of further analysis. The general result of the analysis showed a weak correlation between monetary policy and equity prices. This reflected in the explanatory variables which accounted only 15.6% in the changes of equity prices in Nigeria. All the explanatory variables are negatively and insignificantly related to equity prices, except the consumer price index that has insignificant positive relationship with equity prices. The study has revealed that monetary policy has not made significant influence over the prices of ordinary equities in Nigeria. What this means is that the equities market has not significantly absorbed the monetary policy impulses and therefore cannot be taken as being a good transmission channel for monetary policy implementation in Nigeria until the distortion in the financial system caused by huge fiscal spending is corrected. This study therefore recommends that policy makers should be aware of these weak monetary policy impacts on equities market, and make their decisions in a more effective manner that can link monetary policy to the equities market to ensure price stability and encourage investors.

AB  - This paper studies the role of endogenous producer entry and product creation for monetary policy analysis and business cycle dynamics in a general equilibrium model with imperfect price adjustment. Optimal monetary policy stabilizes product prices, but lets the consumer price index vary to accommodate changes in the number of available products. The free-entry condition links the price of equity (the value of products) with marginal cost and markups and hence with inflation dynamics. No-arbitrage between bonds and equity links the expected return on shares, and thus the financing of product creation, with the return on bonds, affected by monetary policy via interest rate setting. This new channel of monetary policy transmission through asset prices restores the Taylor Principle in the presence of capital accumulation (in the form of new production lines) and forward-looking interest rate setting, unlike in models with traditional physical capital. We also study the implications of endogenous variety for the New Keynesian Phillips curve and business cycle dynamics more generally, and we document the effects of technology, deregulation, and monetary policy shocks, as well as the second moment properties of our model, by means of numerical examples.

T2  - Journal of Money, Credit and Banking
AB  - This paper provides an explanation for "delayed overshooting" puzzle based on foreign exchange policy's reaction to monetary policy, for Canada in which ample interactions between monetary and foreign exchange policies are found. Foreign exchange policy reaction mitigates the initial effects of monetary policy shocks on the exchange rate. As the effects of the monetary policy shocks are more prolonged than that of the foreign exchange policy reaction, the maximum effect is found in delay.

AB  - Using monthly data, we perform a vector-autoregressive analysis to measure the effects of monetary policy on the Vietnamese economy. We concentrate our attention on the period following the introduction of the Law on Central Bank in January 1998 (which brought the national monetary policy and its objectives in line with international practices). Contrary to previous studies on Vietnam, we find evidence suggesting that monetary policy (through the manipulation of interest rates) is an effective policy tool in stabilizing prices. However, credit growth tends to induce inflationary pressures. In addition, we find that an expansion of broad money supply leads to an increase in industrial production.

T2  - Journal of Regional Science
AB  - In this paper we use time-series techniques to examine whether monetary policy had symmetric effects across U.S. states during the 1958:1–1992:4 period. Impulse response functions from estimated structural vector autoregression models reveal differences in policy responses, which in some cases are substantial. We provide evidence on the reasons for the measured cross-state differential policy responses. The size of a state's response is significantly related to industry-mix variables, providing evidence of an interest rate channel for monetary policy, although the state-level data offer no support for recently advanced credit-channel theories.

AB  - This paper examines whether institutional changes have affected the interaction between the real economy and monetary policy in China. We find evidence that structural changes in the financial and real sectors over the period of our study did influence the way in which monetary policy affected the real economy. There were an increasing influence of interest rates on output over 1984 to 1997 and non-state owned enterprises were increasingly reacting to monetary policy changes, suggesting that banking sector reforms were having effects, despite the fact that most credit was allocated to the loss-making State sector.

T2  - Journal of International Money and Finance
AB  - This paper investigates the performance of various monetary policy rules in an open economy with incomplete exchange rate pass-through. Implementing monetary policy through an exchange rate augmented policy rule does not improve social welfare compared to using an optimized Taylor rule, irrespective of the degree of pass-through. A direct exchange rate response improves welfare only if the other reaction coefficients, on inflation and output, are sub-optimal. However, an indirect exchange rate response, through a policy reaction to Consumer Price Index (CPI) inflation rather than to domestic inflation, is welfare enhancing. This result is independent of whether society values domestic or CPI inflation stabilization.

T2  - Journal of Policy Analysis and Management
AB  - Employing two widely used approaches to identify the effects of monetary policy, this paper explores the differential impact of policy on the labor market outcomes of teenagers, minorities, out-of-school youth, and less-skilled individuals. Evidence from recursive vector autoregressions and autoregressive distributed lag models that use information on the Federal Reserve's contractionary initiatives indicate that the employment-population ratio of minorities is more sensitive to contractionary monetary policy than that of whites. The ratio falls primarily because of an increase in unemployment and not because of a decline in labor force participation. Monetary policy appears to have a disproportionate effect on the unemployment rate of teenagers, particularly African American teenagers. Their employment-population ratios fall because of increased difficulty in obtaining employment. The larger responses are not caused by their higher likelihood of having been employed in industries and occupations that are more sensitive to contractionary monetary policy. © 2004 by the Association for Public Policy Analysis and Management.

T2  - Japan and the World Economy
AB  - In this paper, we empirically investigate the effects of monetary policy shocks on exchange rates in Asian countries. To do so, we use VAR models which impose sign restrictions on impulse responses to identify monetary policy shocks. We find that contractionary monetary policy shocks lead to significant exchange rate appreciation in Malaysia, the People’s Republic of China, and the Republic of Korea. However, in India, Indonesia, the Philippines and Thailand, we find either a significant depreciation or no significant effect. These results suggest that an interest rate increase (or decrease) may not necessarily shield Asian countries from exchange rate depreciation (or appreciation) pressure following a U.S. interest rate increase (or decrease).

TI  - The Effect of Monetary Policy on Real Commodity Prices
AU  - Frankel, Jeffrey A.
AB  - Commodity prices are back. This paper looks at connections between monetary policy, and agricultural and mineral commodities. We begin with the monetary influences on commodity prices, first for a large country such as the United States, then smaller countries. The claim is that low real interest rates lead to high real commodity prices. The theory is an analogy with Dornbusch overshooting. The relationship between real interest rates and real commodity prices is also supported empirically. One channel through which this effect is accomplished is a negative effect of interest rates on the desire to carry commodity inventories. The paper concludes with a consideration of implications for monetary policy.

T2  - Economic Papers: A journal of applied economics and policy
AB  - Using a time series cross-state panel data of 50 U.S. states and the District of Columbia (DC) over the period of 1959 through 2015, this article intends to assess the direct and indirect effects of contractionary monetary policy shocks on income inequality through interest rate and consumer price index (CPI) inflation channels. To address this, the authors examine two possible linear and non-linear relationships between inflation and income inequality and between gross domestic product (GDP) and income inequality. Using various measures of income inequality, the results of the pooled model and the individual fixed effect model show that CPI inflation positively and interest rate negatively affect all measures of income inequality in linear regression. The results confirm the existence of the non-linearity relationship between inflation and income inequality as well as the Kuznets inverted ?U-shaped? hypothesis between GDP and income inequality. The results of linear and non-linear regressions show that the DC and the state of Ohio are better off and worse off than the state of Alabama as baseline of models, respectively. The impulse response functions (IRFs) for the individual panel vector autoregressive (PVAR) models show that income inequality could be reduced by implementing contractionary monetary policy through interest rate channel in the short run and increased persistently pursuing contractionary monetary policies via inflation channel in the long run.

AB  - We study the differential regional effects of monetary policy exploiting geographical heterogeneity in income across cities in the United States. We find that prices and employment in poorer cities react more to monetary policy shocks. The results for prices hold for a wide range of narrow consumer expenditure categories. The results are consistent with New Keynesian models that allow for a differential share of hand-to-mouth consumers across regions, but not with models in which regions have different slopes of the Phillips curve. We show that an increase in heterogeneity across cities amplifies the effect of monetary policy on prices and employment.

Using quarterly data spanning from 1973:1 to 2003:4, we examine whether monetary policy shocks have different sectoral effects. Taking note of structural transformation of the economy and the monetary and financial reforms during 1990s, we also assess whether the reform process has notable impact on the monetary transmission mechanism. We find evidence supporting sector-specific variation in the real effects of monetary policy. Our results also suggest significant changes in the transmission of monetary shock to real sector of the economy during post-reform period.

TI  - Monetary policy framework in India
AU  - Dua, Pami
T2  - Indian Economic Review
AB  - In 2016, the monetary policy framework moved towards flexible inflation targeting and a six member Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) was constituted for setting the policy rate. With this step towards modernization of the monetary policy process, India joined the set of countries that have adopted inflation targeting as their monetary policy framework. The Consumer Price Index (CPI combined) inflation target was set by the Government of India at 4% with ± 2% tolerance band for the period from August 5, 2016 to March 31, 2021. In this backdrop, the paper reviews the evolution of monetary policy frameworks in India since the mid-1980s. It also describes the monetary policy transmission process and its limitations in terms of lags and rigidities. It highlights the importance of unconventional monetary policy measures in supplementing conventional tools especially during the easing cycle. Further, it examines the voting pattern of the MPC in India and compares this with that of various developed and emerging economies. The synchronization of cuts in the policy rate by MPCs of various countries during the global slowdown in 2019 and the COVID-19 pandemic in the early 2020s is also analysed.

AB  - Monetary shocks have distributional consequences if they affect relative prices across goods consumed by different households. We document that the prices of the goods consumed by high-income households are stickier and less volatile than those of the goods consumed by middle-income households. Following a monetary policy shock, the estimated impulse responses of high-income households’ consumer price indices are about one-third smaller than those of the middle-income households. We evaluate the implications of these findings in a quantitative multi-sector New–Keynesian model featuring heterogeneous households. The distributional consequences of monetary policy shocks are large and similar to those in the econometric model.

We have, for the first time, studied the impact of monetary policy on consumer price index (CPI) inflation. In response to a shock to the operating target, the maximum decline in gross domestic product growth occurs with a lag of two to three quarters, while the impact on inflation (both CPI and wholesale price index) is felt with a lag of three to four quarters. The interest rate channel is found to be the most dominant channel of monetary policy transmission in India.

We show that this signaling effect of monetary policy can give rise to the empirical puzzles reported in the literature, and propose a new high-frequency instrument for monetary policy shocks that accounts for informational rigidities. We find that a monetary tightening is unequivocally contractionary, with deterioration of domestic demand, labor and credit market conditions as well as of asset prices and agents' expectations.

TI  - Monetary Policy Transmission in Mauritius Using a VAR Analysis
AU  - Tsangarides, Mr Charalambos G.
AB  - Applying commonly used vector autoregression (VAR) techniques, this paper investigates the transmission mechanism of monetary policy on output and prices for Mauritius, using data for 1999-2009. The results show that (i) an unexpected monetary policy tightening-an increase in the Bank of Mauritius policy interest rate-leads to a decline in prices and output but the effect on output is weaker; (ii) an unexpected decrease in the money supply or an unexpected increase in the nominal effective exchange rate result in a decrease in prices; and (iii) variations of the policy variables account for small a percentage of the fluctuations in output and prices. Taken together, these results suggest a rather weak monetary policy transmission mechanism. Finally, we find some differences in the transmission mechanism depending on whether core or headline consumer price index is used in the estimations.

TI  - Interactions between monetary policy and exchange rate in inflation targeting emerging countries: the case of three East Asian countries
AU  - Sek, Siok Kun
AB  - This paper investigates empirically how the reaction of monetary policy to exchange rate has changed after the adoption of inflation targeting regime in three East Asian countries. Using a structural VAR and single equation methods, this study shows that the reactions of monetary policy to exchange rate shocks as well as CPI (demand shocks) and output (supply shocks) have declined under the inflation targeting environment. The policy function reacts weakly to the exchange rate movements before and after the financial crisis of 1997 in two out of the three countries.

AB  - Fiscal and monetary policy coordination should focus on increasing public welfare and maintaining long-term macroeconomic stability. This article aims to enhance the theoretical and methodological basis of fiscal and monetary policy formation and determine the priority areas for improving their coordination to ensure sustainable economic development. We developed an institutional approach to study the fiscal-monetary mix. It is advisable to create favorable monetary conditions for fiscal measures and form a balanced budget for monetary regulation. The authors proposed the structural-functional model that highlights both fiscal and monetary policies’ impact on aggregate demand. The results showed no positive effects of general government expenditures on the GDP per capita growth in 19 emerging economies from 1995 to 2018. The influence of public spending on economic growth depends on institutions’ quality, the composition of expenditures, and fiscal architecture. The expediency of increasing the share of productive expenditures that positively affect stimulating the economy is substantiated. In the long-run, monetary policy should ensure a comprehensive combination of inflation targeting conditions, the adaptive use of tools to achieve intermediate and final targets.

The size of international capital movements and the financial intermediation industry has become so large that these factors could become the dominant impulses for individual economies and the global economy in the 1990s and beyond. This book collects essays by well-known analysts in international economics and finance who treat these issues from relatively new perspectives.

TI  - THE EFFECT OF MONETARY POLICY ON STOCK MARKET PERFORMANCE IN NIGERIA.
AU  - Osuagwu, Eze
AB  - This paper investigates the impact of monetary policy variables on the performance of the stock market in Nigeria using quarterly data for twenty four years (1984:1 – 2007:4). A linear
combination of stock market index and monetary policy variables is estimated using ordinary least squares; co-integration and error-correction specification. It is observed that stock market performance is strongly determined by broad money supply, exchange rates and consumer price index in the short and long-run. Hence, the liquidity, exchange rate and price
level channel of monetary policy transmission is supported by evidence as determinants of stock price movements in Nigeria. On the other hand, minimum rediscount rate and treasury
bill rates show mixed results, they were unable to demonstrate significant relationship to changes in stock market index, though their coefficients follow expectations. However, on a parsimonious examination of the variables, it is observed that a significant relationship exists if used discriminately. Hence, for the interest rate channel of monetary policy transmission to
effect changes in stock market index either minimum rediscount rate or treasury bills rate should be applied at a time and not simultaneously.

AB  - The papers collected in this volume were written for a conference held at the Hong Kong Monetary Authority in November 2005. It was organised jointly by the BIS Representative Office for Asia and the Pacific in Hong Kong SAR and the Hong Kong Institute for Monetary Research. The objective of the conference was to take stock of the current practice of monetary policy in a broad cross section of Asian economies. Papers on China, Hong Kong, India, Indonesia, Japan, Korea, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam were presented and discussed at the conference and subsequently revised by the authors. In addition, the experience of a "mature" inflation targeter, the Reserve Bank of Australia, was presented. The result is an up-to-date account and assessment of the strategies followed by the respective central banks and monetary authorities.

TI  - Evaluating inflation targeting as a monetary policy objective for India

T2  - Economic Modelling
AB  - This study formulates a small open economy model for India with exchange rate as a prominent channel of monetary policy. The model is estimated using the Instrumental Variable-Generalized Methods of Moments (IV-GMM) estimator and evaluated through simulations. This study compares different cases of domestic and CPI inflation targeting, strict and flexible inflation targeting, and simple Taylor type rules. The analysis highlights the unsuitability of simple Taylor-type monetary rules in stabilizing the Indian economy and suggests that discretionary optimization works better in stabilizing this economy. There seems to be a trade-off between output gap stabilization and exchange rate stabilization in flexible domestic inflation targeting and CPI inflation targeting respectively. However, flexible domestic inflation targeting seems a better alternative from an overall macro stabilization perspective in India where financial markets are still not sufficiently integrated to ensure quick transmission of interest rate impulses and existence of rigidities in the economy.

AB  - We investigate the possible existence of asymmetries among Euro Area countries reactions to the European Central Bank monetary policy. Our analysis is based on a Structural Dynamic Factor model estimated on a large panel of Euro Area quarterly variables. Although the introduction of the euro has changed the monetary transmission mechanism in the individual countries towards a more homogeneous response, we find that differences still remain between North and South Europe in terms of prices and unemployment. These results are the consequence of country-specific structures, rather than of European Central Bank policies.

AB  - This paper constructs a new series of monetary policy surprises for the United Kingdom and estimates their effects on macroeconomic and financial variables, employing a high-frequency identification procedure. First, using local projections methods, we find that monetary policy has persistent effects on real interest rates and breakeven inflation. Second, employing our series of surprises as an instrument in a SVAR, we show that monetary policy affects economic activity, prices, the exchange rate, exports and imports. Finally, we implement a test of overidentifying restrictions, which exploits the availability of the narrative series of monetary policy shocks computed by Cloyne and Huertgen (2014), and find no evidence that either set of shocks contains any endogenous response to macroeconomic variables.

AB  - Este paper analiza los efectos de un shock al precio del petróleo desde una perspectiva de equilibrio general. Desarrollamos un modelo estocástico de equilibrio general dinámico (DSGE) estimado por métodos Bayesianos para la economía Chilena. El modelo asume que el petróleo entra tanto en la canasta de consumo de los hogares como en la función de producción de las firmas domésticas. Con el modelo estimado, simulamos como habrían reaccionado la política monetaria y otras variables en respuesta a un shock al precio del petróleo bajo la regla de política que describe de mejor manera el comportamiento de la autoridad monetaria en Chile. Además, simulamos la respuesta contra factual de las mismas variables asumiendo que los precios y salarios son flexibles, y bajo reglas de política alternativas. Mostramos que un incremento del precio real del petróleo de 13% genera una caída en el producto de alrededor de 0,5% y un aumento de la inflación de cerca de 0,4%. Este efecto contractivo del shock de petróleo se debe principalmente a la respuesta endógena de la política monetaria para controlar la inflación.

AB  - Understanding how monetary policy decisions affect inflation and other economic variables is particularly important. In this paper we consider the implications of monetary policy under the inflation targeting regime in Romania, based on an autoregressive vector method including recursive VAR and structural VAR (SVAR). Therefore, we focus on assessing the extent and persistence of monetary policy effects on gross domestic product (GDP), price level, extended monetary aggregate (M3) and exchange rate. The main results of VAR analysis reflect a negative response of consumer price index (CPI), GDP and M3 and positive nominal exchange rate behaviour to a monetary policy shock, and also a limited impact of a short-term interest rate shock in explaining the consumer prices, production and exchange rate fluctuations.

AU  - Di Giacinto, Valter
T2  - International Regional Science Review
AB  - The study of possible asymmetric effects of monetary policy at a spatially disaggregated scale has received increasing attention in the literature. Different econometric approaches have been proposed to quantify the differences in monetary policy transmission, such as large-scale simultaneous equations models or structural vector autoregressive (SVAR) models. This article builds on the SVAR approach and extends it by incorporating geographical information, using spatial econometric techniques. The author employs information on spatial proximity to derive parameter constraints, enabling joint estimation for medium- and large-sized panels. Moreover, the use of spatial a priori information makes it possible to identify and estimate contemporaneous spatial spillover effects. Specific attention is paid to parameter identification when introducing the model. Subsequently, the author discusses parameter estimation, which is complicated by the simultaneous spatial dependence structure and the need to impose complex parameter constraints. An empirical application is provided with respect to U.S. states.

AB  - This paper provides a baseline general equilibrium model of optimal monetary policy among interdependent economies with monopolistic firms and nominal rigidities. An inward-looking policy of domestic price stabilization is not optimal when firms’ markups are exposed to currency fluctuations. Such a policy raises exchange rate volatility, leading foreign exporters to charge higher prices vis-à-vis increased uncertainty in the export market. As higher import prices reduce the purchasing power of domestic consumers, optimal monetary rules trade off a larger domestic output gap against lower consumer prices. Optimal rules in a world Nash equilibrium lead to less exchange rate volatility relative to both inward-looking rules and discretionary policies, even when the latter do not suffer from any inflationary (or deflationary) bias. Gains from international monetary cooperation are related in a non-monotonic way to the degree of exchange rate pass-through.

TI  - Monetary Policy Rule, Exchange Rate Regime, and Fiscal Policy Cyclicality in a Developing Oil Economy
AU  - Algozhina, Aliya
AB  - According to Frankel and Catao (2011), a commodity exporting developing economy is advised to target the output price index rather than consumer price index, as the former monetary policy is automatically countercyclical against the volatile terms of trade shock. This paper constructs a dynamic stochastic general equilibrium model of joint monetary and fiscal policies for a developing oil economy, to find an appropriate monetary rule combined with a pro/counter/acyclical fiscal stance based on a loss measure. The foreign exchange interventions distinguish between a managed and flexible exchange rate regime, while fiscal policy cyclicality depends on the oil output response of public consumption and public investment. The study reveals that the best policy combination is a countercyclical fiscal stance and CPI inflation monetary targeting under a flexible exchange rate regime to stabilize equally the domestic price inflation, aggregate output, and real exchange rate in a small open economy. This result is conditional on weights for those three variables used in the loss measure.

TI  - Effects of monetary policy on macro economic performance: the case of Nigeria
AU  - Isedu, Mustafa
A3  - Mehari, Tesfa
A3  - Ugur, Mehmet
AB  - The objective of this study is to empirically examine the effects of monetary policy on macroeconomic performance in Nigeria. The study uses Quarterly data between 1970 Q1 to 2011Q4, being a sample period of forty one years. The study further, introduces structural break to investigate the presence of a possible structural change which takes into account the effects of the Structural Adjustment Programme introduced by the Nigerian government in the 1987. The data was split into two sub-periods from 1970Q1–1986Q4, era before the Structural adjustment programme, and from 1987Q1 – 2011Q4, period after the Structural Adjustment Programme in Nigeria. In this study, three approaches were utilised in the methodology. First, estimation and analysis was based on coefficients of the variables using long-run and co-integrating Vector Error Correction Model (VECM). The results confirm my a priori expectation, although many of the variables were not statistically significant. The study also estimates the period 1970Q1–2011Q4, without a structural break for the GDP model having been confirmed in a structural break test. Therefore, we accept the null hypothesis which means that there was no structural break in real domestic growth during the structural adjustment programme, introduced in 1987. However, the structural break tests for consumers’ price index (CPI) and balance of payments (BOP) show that the parameters of the analysed equations were not stable given that recursive errors cut across the critical lines for both tests. As a result of the foregoing, we reject the null hypothesis meaning that there was a structural break for the CPI and (BOP) models. This means that the structural adjustment programme introduced in 1987 brought about a change in CPI and BOP in the Nigerian economy. In the second approach of the methodology, a macroeconomic model was simulated to demonstrate the effects of monetary policy on macroeconomic performance. Thus, the results obtained from the simulation are impressive and generally satisfactory; the results suggest the effectiveness of monetary policy implementation for counter cyclical income stabilization, BOP stabilization and CPI stabilization in Nigeria. In the third approach of my methodology, three structural vector autoregressive (SVAR) econometric models were formulated to trace the effects of monetary policy shocks on domestic output, consumers’ price index and balance of payments position in Nigeria. Structural effects of monetary shocks or innovations were captured by the impulse response functions and the forecast error variance decomposition. The empirical impulse-response assessment indicates that an exogenous shock to the short-term interest rate has the most significant positive effect on real domestic output and consumers’ price followed by a transitory effect of the broad money. The response of the country’s external payments’ position to a structural shock as measured by a one-standard deviation innovation in all the policy variables is almost zero. The policy implication is straightforward- monetary policy in Nigeria is effective in maintaining internal balance and ineffective in achieving external balance. Overall, the results suggest that monetary policy affects macroeconomic performance in Nigeria.

TI  - Housing and Monetary Policy in the Business Cycle: What do Housing Rents have to Say?
AU  - Duarte, Joao
AU  - Dias, Daniel
AB  - In this paper we unveil a feedback loop between monetary policy, housing tenure choice (own vs rent) and measured inflation and quantify its consequences. This feedback loop is explained in three parts: i) Housing rents respond positively to contractionary monetary policy shocks; ii) This effect of interest rates on housing rents gives rise to an important and systematic inflation mismeasurement problem because, directly and indirectly, housing rents weigh approximately 30\% in the CPI and 13\% in the PCE; iii) When interest rates are set according to a Taylor rule, the systematic mismeasurement of inflation gives rise to a feedback loop by which the monetary authority keeps setting interest rates too high (low) because inflation is apparently too high (low). To rationalize i) and quantify the importance of iii) we propose a standard New Keynesian model augmented with an endogenous housing tenure choice mechanism. Using a calibrated version of the model, we do a counterfactual exercise and estimate that, when the monetary authority targets the implied consumer price index net of housing rents instead of the implied consumer price index, the loss function of monetary policy is 14.5\% lower and the welfare in terms of consumption equivalent variation is 0.9\% higher. Finally, analyzing the same alternative scenario for the 1983-2006 US experience, we find that the standard deviation of housing prices and nominal inflation would have been 24.8\% and 19.9\% lower, respectively.

AB  - We lay out a small open economy version of the Calvo sticky price model, and show how the equilibrium dynamics can be reduced to a simple representation in domestic inflation and the output gap. We use the resulting framework to analyse the macroeconomic implications of three alternative rule-based policy regimes for the small open economy: domestic inflation and CPI-based Taylor rules, and an exchange rate peg. We show that a key difference among these regimes lies in the relative amount of exchange rate volatility that they entail. We also discuss a special case for which domestic inflation targeting constitutes the optimal policy, and where a simple second order approximation to the utility of the representative consumer can be derived and used to evaluate the welfare losses associated with the suboptimal rules.

TI  - Monetary Policy Under Emu Differences in the Transmission Mechanism?
AU  - Clements, Benedict
AU  - Kontolemis, Zenon G.
AU  - Levy, Joaquim
AB  - This study identifies differences in the monetary policy transmission mechanism across the countries in the euro area. It is argued that part of the differences in the response of economic activity to monetary policy during the pre-EMU period, found in other studies, reflected differences in monetary policy reaction functions, rather than different transmission mechanisms. In light of this, the paper constructs an empirical model on the basis of common reaction functions. The results confirm that even when a common monetary policy is implemented, its effects on economic activity are likely to differ across EMU countries. The paper also constructs an aggregate measure of the effect of monetary policy on prices and output. Finally, the paper examines the relative strength of the credit, exchange rate, and interest rate channels of monetary transmission in EMU countries.

AB  - We create a parsimonious monetary policy exposure (MPE) index based on observable firm characteristics that previous studies link to how stocks react to monetary policy. Our index successfully captures stocks’ responses to both conventional and unconventional monetary policy. Stocks whose prices react more positively to expansionary monetary policy (high-MPE stocks) earn lower average returns. This result is consistent with the notion that high-MPE stocks provide a hedge against bad economic shocks, to which the Federal Reserve responds with expansionary monetary policy. A long-short trading strategy designed to exploit this effect achieves an annualized Sharpe Ratio of 0.77.

TI  - Incomplete Exchange Rate Pass-Through and Simple Monetary Policy Rules
AU  - Adolfson, Malin
AB  - This paper investigates the performance of various monetary rules in an open economy with incomplete exchange rate pass-through. Implementing monetary policy through an exchange rate augmented policy rule does not improve social welfare compared to using an optimized Taylor rule, irrespective of the degree of pass-through. A direct exchange rate response improves welfare only if the other reaction coefficients, on inflation and output, are sub-optimal. However, an indirect exchange rate response, through a policy reaction to Consumer Price Index (CPI) inflation rather than to domestic inflation, is welfare enhancing. This result is independent of whether society values domestic or CPI inflation stabilization.

TI  - Monetary policy, foreign exchange intervention, and the exchange rate in a unifying framework
AU  - Kim, Soyoung
T2  - Journal of International Economics
AB  - The structural VAR model is developed to jointly analyze the effects of foreign exchange intervention and (money or interest rate setting) conventional monetary policy on the exchange rate, the two types of policy reactions to the exchange rate, and interactions between the two types of policies. First, many interactions among the two types of policies and the exchange rate are found, which suggests that a joint analysis is important. Second, foreign exchange intervention has substantial effects on the exchange rate, reacts to the exchange rate significantly (to stabilize the exchange rate), and signals future conventional monetary policy stance changes (to back up the intervention). This suggests the importance of modeling foreign exchange intervention explicitly in the study of monetary policy and exchange rate behaviors. Many other interesting results on the interactions among the two types of policies and the exchange rate are also documented.

Impulse response functions from an estimated structural vector autoregression reveal a core of regions—New England, Mideast, Plains, Southeast, and the Far West— that respond to monetary policy changes in ways that closely approximate the U.S. average response. Of the three noncore regions, one (Great Lakes) is noticeably more sensitive to monetary policy changes, and two (Southwest and Rocky Mountains) are found to be much less sensitive. A state-level version of the model is estimated and used to provide evidence on the channels for monetary policy.

AB  - Considering external constraints on monetary policy in emerging countries, we propose a semi-structural vector autoregressive model with exogenous variables (VARX) to examine the exchange rate pass-through to domestic prices. We demonstrate that a lower exchange rate pass-through is associated with a credible monetary policy aiming at controlling inflation. The empirical results suggest that the exchange rate pass-through is higher in Latin American countries than in East Asian countries. The exchange rate pass-through has declined after the adoption of an inflation targeting monetary policy.

T2  - Russian Journal of Money and Finance
AB  - The current paper studies the monetary policy transmission in the Russian economy. The key question of this work is how monetary policy aﬀects the macroeconomy through currency exchange rates. I construct a series of monetary policy surprises for the Russian economy using the highfrequency identiﬁcation approach. Many papers use futures on the interest rates as monetary policy instruments; however, we do not have these futures in the Russian ﬁnancial market. Therefore, I use diﬀerent currency futures as monetary surprises because these futures are liquid, and they can reveal the market sentiment. I take the dates when the Board of Directors of the Central Bank of Russia made a decision on the key rate and looked at the changes in the currency exchange market in a tiny 30-minute window. Next, I construct a structural vector autoregression model to show the eﬀect of these surprises on macroeconomic variables. In the identiﬁcation process, I use an external instrument approach a-la Gertler and Karadi. Finally, I compare the results with other methods (Cholesky decomposition). I ﬁnd that the tightening monetary policy signiﬁcantly increases bonds rate; moreover, the eﬀect on the inﬂation is not immediate, but it appears after a couple of months.

AB  - The pass-through of exchange rate changes into domestic inflation appears to have declined in many countries since the 1980s. We develop a theoretical model that attributes the change in the rate of pass-through to increased emphasis on inflation stabilization by many central banks. This hypothesis is tested on 20 industrial countries between 1971 and 2003. We find widespread evidence of a robust and statistically significant link between estimated rates of pass-through and inflation variability. We also find evidence that observed monetary policy behaviour may be a factor in the declining rate of pass-through. Published in 2004 by John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AU  - Apere, ThankGod Oyinpreye

AB  - This study examined the effectiveness of monetary policy on economic growth and inflation in Nigeria over the period 1970 to 2011. The lag selection criteria all indicated an optimum lag length of one, therefore a VAR (1) model was estimated using GDP, INTR, CPI, and M2 as endogenous variables. The model was dynamically stable and showed no evidence of serial correlation. Estimation results showed that in the short run it is output and inflation that drives monetary growth, while output growth is affected by inflation only. Results from the impulse response and variance decomposition showed that monetary policy variables may not have an instantaneous impact on output, but are key determinants of output growth in the long–run. Furthermore, in the short–run the level of production is more important in controlling inflation, but it is monetary policy variables that matter in the long–run. Therefore, there is the need to differentiate between short and long run monetary policy targets. It was recommended that, policy makers should concentrate on short-run output expansion policies and put measures in place to sustain growth in the long-run to control inflation. But to maintain longrun output expansion, monetary authorities should aim at adjusting the inter-bank rate but with caution as this can instead cause the problem it is meant to solve.

Using the detailed Household Income and Expenditure Survey and Korean Labor and Income Panel Study data, we construct measures of income and wealth inequality for the Korean economy. Empirical results show that both domestic and external monetary policy shocks exert significant countercyclical effects on income inequality. For wealth inequality, however, the effects are very different. Whereas domestic monetary policy shocks are insignificant, external policy shocks proxied by fluctuations in net capital flows seem to have significant effects on net wealth inequality.

We build quarterly and monthly housing market datasets for eight OECD countries, estimating a range of specifications in panel vector autoregressions identified through a combination of zero and sign restrictions across both frequencies. Despite a minor amount of individual cross-country heterogeneity, our mean group panel estimators show a positive, persistent response of house prices which peaks at between one and two years following a policy shock. Residential investment responds more strongly than house prices, but takes longer to peak, consistent with the conveyancing procedures involved in construction. Mortgage rates are shown to initially decrease by between five and six basis points following a 3% balance sheet shock.

TI  - The effect of monetary policy on credit risk: evidence from the MENA region countries
AU  - Mahrous, Sherif Nabil

AU  - Abdelsalam, Mamdouh Abdelmoula M.
T2  - Review of Economics and Political Science
AB  - Purpose The purpose of this paper is to explore the effect of monetary policy on bank risk in the banking system in some MENA countries. It explores how some economic and credit indicators affect the level of risk in the banking sector. It combines many factors that could affect banks’ risk appetite such as macroeconomic conditions, banks’ credit size and lending growth. The authors use nonperforming loans as a proxy for banking sector risks. At first, the authors have analyzed the linear relationship between monetary policy and credit risk. As mentioned above, nonlinearity is expected in the underlying relationship, and, thus, they have investigated the nonlinear relationship to deeply analyse the relationship using the dynamic panel threshold model, as stimulated by Kremer et al. (2013). Threshold models have gained a great importance in economics and finance for modelling nonlinear behaviour. Threshold models are useful in showing the turning points in the behaviour of financial and economic indicators. This technique has been applied in this study to study the effect of monetary policy on credit risk. Design/methodology/approach This paper is divided into the following sections: Section 2 which previews the recent literature; Section 3 which includes some stylized facts about the relationship between credit risk and monetary policy; Section 4 which deals with the model and methodology; Section 5 which handles the data sources and discusses the results, and finally Section 6 which is the conclusion. The paper adopts dynamic panel threshold model of Kremer et al. (2013). Findings The results show that the relationship between monetary policy and credit risk is positive and significant to a certain threshold, 6.3. If the lending interest rate is higher than 6.3, this increases the credit risk in the banking sector, because increasing the lending interest rate imposes huge burdens on the borrowers, and, therefore, the bad loans and nonperforming loans become more likely. Thus, the MENA countries need to decrease the lending interest rate to be less than 6.3 to reduce the effect of monetary policy on credit risk. Further, these results are qualitatively robust regarding the inclusion of additional control variables, using alternative threshold variables and further endogeneity checks of the credit risk, such as Risk premium and the squared term of the lending interest rate. The results of taking the risk premium and the squared term of the lending interest rate as a threshold served the analysis and confirmed the positive relationship between monetary policy and credit risk above a certain threshold. As for the risk premium, the relationship below the threshold was negative and significant. Other related research points might be a good avenue for the future research such as applying this approach to micro data of banks from different MENA countries. Also, more sophisticated approaches like time-varying panel approach to assess the relationship over the time can be applied. Originality/value The importance of this paper lies in the fact that it does not only study the effect of time, but it also focuses on the panel data about some economic and credit indicators in the MENA region for the first time. This is because central banks in the MENA region have common characteristics and congruous level of economic growth. Therefore, to study how the monetary policy affects those countries’ credit risks in their lending policies, this requires careful analysis of how the central banks in this region might behave to control default risks.

AB  - Stabilizing prices is the goal of macro-economy, and monetary policy has mutual effect with prices. Monetary policy is mainly manifested in the money supply and the interest rate level, and consumer price index (CPI) indicates prices. This paper applies a Time-Varying Parameter Vector Auto Regressive (TVP-VAR) approach to estimate the mutual effects of consumer price index on monetary policy over time. We use monthly data from January 1996 to December 2014, estimate ternary TVP-VAR model by Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC). Our empirical findings indicate the following conclusions: firstly, the growth rate of macroeconomic variables has the same characteristics as financial variables; secondly, all variables which include macroeconomic variables and financial variables have a different fluctuation at different time. In the end, the effect from M2 and SHIBOR on CPI is different between long term and short term. The empirical analysis in this paper indicate the quantity of monetary policy is more important because of significant effect relative to price in monetary policy, while CPI has minute effect on M2 and SHIBOR.

We rely on expectation data from Consensus Economics and a panel vector autoregression framework, which accounts for international spillovers and time-variation. We analyze whether monetary policy has changed the degree of information rigidity after the emergence of the subprime crisis and estimate effects of interest rate changes on expectations, disagreements, and forecast errors. We find strong evidence for information rigidities and identify higher forecast errors by professionals after monetary policy shocks. Our results suggest that the international transmission of monetary policy shocks introduces noisy information and partly increases disagreement among forecasters. (JEL E31, E52)

Using annual data from the 1953–1990 period for a panel of 38 countries, the paper's empirical results support the theoretical predictions: the more open the economy, the smaller (larger) the output (inflation) effects of a given change in the money supply. This finding is robust across all the different specifications and estimation methods examined.

TI  - The Impact of Monetary Policy on Financial Market in South Africa: A VAR Analysis
AU  - Noumbissie, Flavien Fokou
T2  - Journal of Economics and Behavioral Studies
AB  - Like in many other countries, the South African financial market facilitates the process of raising capital by channelling funds to more productive economic activity, thereby building the nation's economy while enhancing job opportunities and wealth creation. The aim of this paper is to assess the impact of monetary policy on financial market in South Africa. It is important to constantly look into this interaction since policy decisions have a direct influence on financial market. A negative response from the market side may jeopardise economic stability. The study uses the vector autoregressive (VAR) model to evaluate the impact of monetary policy on financial market in South Africa. The model consists of five policy instruments as variables; namely: money supply (M3), real exchange rate(ER), discount Rate (R), consumer price index (CPI), gross domestic product (GDP) and the two market related variables: Stock market turnover (S) and Bond market turnover (B). Data is obtained from SARB and OECD databases for a period of 53 quarters from 2000:Q1 to 2013:Q1. By the use of impulse response function (IRF), the study found that given current economic situation in South Africa, stock market turnover reacts positively to money supply; discount rate; real exchange and GDP shocks. On the other hand stock market turnover reacts negatively to CPI economic shocks. To correct CPI negative impact on markets, we suggest that the policymakers could envisage a contractionary monetary policy translated by a proportional cut in money supply through the sales of government securities.

T2  - Journal of Commodity Markets
AB  - If the information held by the central bank is different from that of market participants, then the central bank’s announcement not only affects the view of monetary policy but also the view of economic fundamentals. This study investigates the information effects of monetary policy announcements on oil prices using a structural vector autoregression (VAR) model identified by sign restrictions. The sign restrictions rely on the high-frequency linkage between stock prices and interest rates surrounding the policy announcements. We find that a positive central bank information shock, which raises the interest rate by six basis points, leads to a 1.7% increase in oil prices within two months. We also find that central bank information shocks affect oil prices through the finance and expectation channels.

TI  - Optimal monetary policy delegation under incomplete exchange rate pass-through
AU  - Adolfson, Malin
AB  - The central bank's optimal objective function is analyzed in a small open economy model allowing for incomplete exchange rate pass-through. The results indicate that social welfare can only be marginally improved by including an explicit exchange-rate term in the delegated objective function, irrespective of the degree of pass-through. An implicit response to the exchange rate, through Consumer Price Index (CPI) inflation targeting is, however, beneficial. Welfare can, moreover, be enhanced by appointing a central banker with a greater preference for interest rate smoothing than that of the society, as a result of surpassing some of the stabilization bias arising under a discretionary policy. Consequently, there are welfare gains from monetary policy inertia. The optimal degree of interest rate smoothing is increasing in the degree of pass-through.

TI  - Structural Vector Autoregressive Analysis of Monetary Policy in Thailand
AU  - Popkarn Arwatchanakarn
T2  - Sociology Study
AB  - This paper highlights the importance of monetary policy transmission mechanism in Thailand since the 1997 financial crisis and then undertakes an empirical investigation of Thailand monetary policy. This study makes effort to address both two aspects of monetary transmission mechanism, namely channels of monetary policy and the effect of monetary policy shocks on key macroeconomic variables. To address these issues, the paper specifies structural vector autoregressive (SVAR) models and estimates them using quarterly data from 1997q3 to 2014q4. The identification schemes used in this paper follow Kim and Roubini and Raghavan, Silvapulle, and Athanasopoulos with some modifications. The overall result is that the identifying restrictions used in the SVAR seem to appropriately identify a monetary policy shock even though the exchange rate puzzle is found. The results show that interest rate and monetary aggregate have played the dominant channels of monetary transmission mechanism in Thailand, while an exchange rate channel is decreasingly significant. In addition, Thailand economy is somewhat exposed to the foreign sector especially for the world price of oil and the U.S. monetary policy. The results also reveal the linkage and influence of U.S. monetary policy on Thailand monetary policy. The empirical findings are then used to provide Bank of Thailand (BOT) with insight into identifying the important monetary policy transmission channels. It would help the BOT to implement an effective monetary policy for achieving price stability through the appropriate monetary channels.

TI  - The effect of monetary policy and inflation on the exchange rate: A case study of Ghana
AU  - Allor, Precious Wedaga
T2  - Journal of Economics and International Finance
AB  - The Ghanaian Cedi has recently experienced persistent depreciation against its major trading partners. This paper investigates the contribution of inflation and monetary policy in this persistent depreciation. The paper makes use of the Autoregressive Distributed Lag (ARDL) and Bounds test of cointegration and the Toda and Yamamoto (1995) Augmented Granger Causality test to determine the long and short-run dynamics of the impact of monetary policy and inflation on exchange rates in Ghana, using data ranging from 1970 to 2017. The paper finds a short-run depreciation effect of contractionary monetary policy on the exchange rate, reflecting the exchange rate puzzle. The long-run results however show an appreciating effect. Inflation is also found to depreciate the currency both in the short and long-run. The causality tests also reveal a bi-directional relationship between the exchange rate and the inflation rate, while a unidirectional causal relationship exists between monetary policy and the exchange rate. The paper recommends that inflation stabilization policies should be prioritized in Ghana, as a means to curb the rising exchange rates. Improvement in terms of trade through export value promotion should also be given the needed attention as this is found to appreciate the currency in the long-run.

TI  - Monetary Policy Transmission Mechanisms and Inflation in the Slovak Republic
AU  - Kuijs, Louis
AB  - This paper presents the results of an empirical analysis into monetary policy transmission mechanisms and inflation in the Slovak Republic. The estimated vector autoregression (VAR) model suggests that inflation is determined by changes in foreign prices, the exchange rate, and wage costs, with a modest effect of aggregate demand, in line with theory for small, open economies. Monetary policy is shown to affect inflation via these channels. Changes in money supply seem to have a modest but rapid impact on prices. The measured effect of interest rate changes is modest and gradual, although it appears to have become more important in recent years.

AB  - Purpose The purpose of this paper is to investigate the effects of unanticipated monetary policy innovations on output and price for Ethiopia from 1991:Q1 to 2016:Q1. Design/methodology/approach Short run and long run identification schemes on structural vector autoregressive model are employed in this study. Findings The impulse response function results generated show that while a positive shock in interest rate causes a reduction in output and price puzzle, a positive shock to broad money supply has a positive and significant effect on output and price. A positive shock in real effective exchange rate has also an expansionary, though insignificant, effect on impact on both output and price. These results are especially true for the short run identification scheme. As to the results from the variance decomposition, the study shows that the highest variation in output and price is caused by broad money supply shock in the short run. Originality/value It adds to the scarce empirical literature on the effects of monetary policy innovations on the Ethiopian economy.

AB  - This paper proposes a measure of China's monetary policy uncertainty (MPU) based on a Bayesian MCMC estimation procedure, investigates the economic impact of MPU, and outlines the impact channels. Empirical findings suggest that MPU depresses China's economy via higher credit risk and lower economic growth. Moreover, the decrease in output is amplified and made more persistent when the economy is simultaneously exposed to higher credit risk. Because China has experienced massive credit expansion over the past decades, the economy is currently more vulnerable to the increase in MPU than it ever was.

T2  - International Journal of Academic Research in Accounting, Finance and Management Sciences
AB  - Inflation is an critical aspect of every economy and presents a balancing act to most governments
through regulatory framework. Inflation can break or break the economy of a nation. Hence policy
makers in the government regulating bodies spend considerable time in developing policies aimed at
achieving set targets of inflation which are geared to supporting the broader economic objectives of an
economy. The Central Bank of Kenya (CBK) has responsibility of formulating and implementing monetary
policy to achieve and maintain low inflation. This study set to establish the relationship of monetary
policy tools and inflation in Kenya.. The study used time series empirical data on the variables to describe
and examine the relationships between monetary policy tools and inflation. The study obtained
secondary data on Price Index for inflation, 91-day Treasury bill rate, exchange rate, money supply
(M3)and repo rate for a period of five year (2008- 2012). Analysis on the various variables obtained
coefficients of correlation denoted as ‘β’ which shows the strength of relationship between monetary
policy tools and inflation in Kenya. The study established that inflation and the money supply were
positively correlated with each other. The study established that the general level of prices increase with
the increase of money supply. The study found that the 91 treasury bill rates have an impact on the level
of inflation. The findings of study show that the policy makers need critically evaluate and monitor the
levels of money supply in Kenya so as to ensure a stable retail price levels. The findings also support the
use 91-day Treasury bills rate in monitoring the level of prices because it has a significant effect on the
level of Inflation in Kenya.

TI  - The Effectiveness of Non-Traditional Monetary Policy Measures: The Case of the Bank of Japan
AU  - Ueda, Kazuo
T2  - The Japanese Economic Review
AB  - This paper summarizes non-traditional monetary policy measures adopted by the Bank of Japan (BOJ) during the last 2 decades and by other G7 central banks since the start of the current global financial turmoil and analyses the effectiveness of such measures. The paper begins with a typology of policies usable near the zero lower bound on interest rates. They are: (i) forward guidance of future policy rates; (ii) targeted asset purchases; and (iii) quantitative easing. Using this typology, I review the measures adopted by the BOJ and other central banks. I then offer a news analysis of the effects of the measures adopted by the BOJ on asset prices, comparing them with those adopted by the Fed. Many of the measures, with the exception of strategy (iii), are shown to have moved asset prices in the expected directions. Another exception is that most of the monetary easing measures failed to weaken the yen. Despite some effects on asset prices, however, the measures have failed to stop the deflationary trend of the Japanese economy clearly. I discuss some possible reasons for this and more general implications for monetary policy.

To identify monetary policy shocks, we use the monetary policy surprises from the interest rate futures market as the external instrument, as in the analysis of Gertler and Karadi (2015) for the US. We find that monetary policy has been effective in Japan with its long-run effects becoming stronger when the ELB was binding.

AB  - The term ‘pass-through effect’ (PTE) refers to the effect of changes in the exchange rate of a domestic currency for foreign currency (or a trade-weighted portfolio of foreign currencies) on the country’s domestic prices for traded and non-traded goods. PTE of exchange rate changes on domestic prices is one of the major factors of transission of shocks in an open economy. Lafleche (1996) offered a diagram, which described these mechanisms of reaction of domestic prices to depreciation of domestic currency. A variety of mechanisms through which a change in exchange rate affects all domestic prices are thoroughly described in Lafleche (1996). Before the end of the 1970s academic economists did not pay enough attention to this phenomenon. However, in recent years this topic has became increasingly popular in many countries, perhaps in response to globalisation of the international markets and foreign trade growth. Higher PTE implies greater dependence of an open economy on external shocks in the world market and higher volatility of domestic prices due to changes in the exchange rate. Therefore, the government authorities should know the degree of PTE to forecast domestic inflation and conduct adequate inflationary and exchange rate policies.

AB  - The Federal Reserve has played an arguably important role in financial crises in the United States since its creation in 1913 through monetary policy tools. Thus, this paper aims to analyze the impact of monetary policy on the United States’ economic growth in the short and long run, measured by Gross Domestic Product (GDP). The Vector Autoregressive (VAR) method explores the relationship among the variables, and the Granger causality test assesses the predictability of the variables. Moreover, the Impulse Response Function (IRF) examines the behavior of one variable after a change in another, utilizing the time-series dataset from the first quarter of 1959 to the second quarter of 2022. This work demonstrates that expansionary monetary policy does have a positive impact on economic growth in the short term though it does not last long. However, in the long term, inflation, measured by the Consumer Price Index (CPI), is affected by expansionary monetary policy. Therefore, if the Federal Reserve wants to cease the expansionary monetary policy in the short run, this should be done appropriately, with the fiscal surplus, to preserve its credibility and trust in the US dollar as a global store of value asset. Also, the paper’s findings suggest that continuous expansion of the Money Supply will lead to a long-term inflationary problem. The purpose of this research is to bring the spotlight to the side effects of expansionary monetary policy on the US economy, but also allow other researchers to test this model in different economies with different dynamics.

AB  - In simple backward-looking structural models of the economy the optimal monetary policy rule is given by a Taylor-type interest rate rule, with the interest rate being a function of current and lagged inflation rates and the current and lagged output gap. Such a rule is optimal because current and past inflation rates and output gaps are sufficient statistics for future inflation and demand conditions, which are targeted by the central bank. We show that future demand conditions and CPI inflation in the G7 countries are also determined by the exchange rate and property and share prices. Taking the UK as an example we discuss the implications of this finding for the conduct of monetary policy and show that disregarding asset price movements leads to a sub-optimal outcome for the economy in terms of inflation and output gap variability. This result not only obtains because the information contained in asset prices about future demand conditions is ignored, but also because their omission from the model introduces considerable biases, so that monetary policy would be based on a mis-specified model of the economy. We also show how a Financial Conditions Index (FCI), a weighted average of the short-term real interest rate, the real exchange rate, real property and real share prices can be derived based on the estimated models. The derived FCI appears to be a useful predictor of future CPI inflation.

TI  - Oil Price Pass-Through Into Consumer and Producer Prices With Monetary Policy in China: Are There Non-linear and Mediating Effects
AU  - Chen, Shuanglian

T2  - Frontiers in Energy Research
AB  - Balancing the oil pass-through to consumer and producer prices is crucial for policymakers. This study aimed to advance associated thinking by examining how consumer and producer prices in China related to changes in global oil prices from 2006 to 2018. First, we investigated the pass-through of oil spot prices to consumer prices as indicated by the consumer price index (CPI) and means of consumption price index (MCPI), and to producer prices as indicated by the producer price index (PPI) and means of production price index (MPPI), with a monetary policy in China. This study also explored the non-linear and mediating effects of financial markets and government debt on linkages between oil prices and consumer/producer prices based on non-linear framework and causal steps approach, respectively. Our findings indicated some key points; for example, the pass-through of oil prices with a monetary policy in China shed light on a benchmark role in global oil markets. Additionally, the non-linear effect of oil prices on consumer/producer prices varied across the Brent and West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil markets. The mediating effect of government debt also reflected the effectiveness in balancing the relationship between oil prices and producer prices. Government debt explained the −0.091 transition between the Brent oil price and the PPI and could explain the −0.095 transition between the Brent oil price and the MPPI, whereas the transition due to financial markets were −0.064 and −0.080, respectively. These outcomes have important implications for stabilizing price levels in countries.

AB  - This paper employs an approximation that makes a nonlinear term structure model extremely tractable for analysis of an economy operating near the zero lower bound for interest rates. We show that such a model offers an excellent description of the data compared to the benchmark model and can be used to summarize the macroeconomic effects of unconventional monetary policy. Our estimates imply that the efforts by the Federal Reserve to stimulate the economy since July 2009 succeeded in making the unemployment rate in December 2013 1% lower, which is 0.13% more compared to the historical behavior of the Fed.

TI  - Information Effects of Euro Area Monetary Policy: New Evidence from High-Frequency Futures Data
AU  - Kerssenfischer, Mark
AB  - Central bank announcements move financial markets. The response of inflation and growth expectations, on the other hand, is often small or even counterintuitive. Based on tick-by-tick futures prices on bonds and stock prices, I confirm these seemingly puzzling results for the euro area and provide evidence that they are due to central bank information effects. That is, ECB announcements convey information not only about monetary policy, but also about economic fundamentals. I separate these "information shocks" from "pure policy shocks" via sign restrictions and find intuitive effects of both shocks on a wide set of financial market prices and survey measures of economic expectations.

AU  - Wu, Wenbin
T2  - Review of Economic Dynamics
AB  - Despite their prevalence in the microdata, sales (i.e., temporary price cuts) are often ignored by macroeconomists. If sales are taken into account, price rigidity is small in the data. Using the microdata underlying the Consumer Price Index (CPI), I first demonstrate that sales of durable goods have a substantial impact on the aggregate price index, and that the price index decreases gradually after these sales. To quantify the changes in the real effects of monetary policy due to sales, I propose a two-sector menu-cost model, in which sales are allowed. The model, which is able to match salient features of the microdata, predicts that the real effects of monetary policy will be significantly overestimated if sales of durable goods are not taken into consideration. Compared to my benchmark model, the model without sales and the Calvo model calibrated to the frequency of regular price changes both generate much greater real effects of monetary policy.

AU  - Deng, Qi

T2  - Journal of Mathematics
AB  - Using the monthly data from December 2008 to March 2018 and a panel vector autoregression (PVAR) model, this paper empirically analyzes the spillover effects of U.S. monetary policy normalization on the total output, inflation, trade balance, and exchange rates in BRICS. The results show that the Fed’s interest rate hike and balance sheet shrinking will both lead to a decrease in BRICS’ output, a decline in inflation, a deterioration in the trade balance, and a depreciation of the exchange rate. In addition, the spillover effects of the Fed’s interest rate hike and shrinking of a balance sheet are both relatively long lasting, but there is a certain difference between the two effects; that is, the Fed’s interest rate hike has a greater impact on the macroeconomic variables of BRICS countries than the shrinking of balance sheet. Based on the conclusions, we propose to establish and improve the regulatory system of international capital flows, pay close attention to commodity prices, and strengthen policy coordination and communication among BRICS countries so as to mitigate the adverse impact of U.S. monetary policy normalization.

Unlike the recent contributions to the literature on exchange rates and monetary policy news, our testing method avoids the imposition of assumptions regarding exchange rate market efficiency. We also add to the debate on how quickly exchange rates respond to news by showing that the exchange rates under study absorb monetary policy surprises within the same day as the news are announced.

TI  - Effectiveness of monetary policy: evidence from Turkey
AU  - Avci, S. Burcu

T2  - Eurasian Economic Review
AB  - An effective monetary policy framework is often viewed as a pre-condition for well-functioning financial markets. Yet measuring monetary policy effectiveness is not straightforward; it requires empirical work to understand the impact of financial infrastructure, competitiveness of financial markets, and current economic conditions. In particular, monetary policy effectiveness depends on the extent to which the chosen interest rate affects all other financial prices—including the entire term structure of interest rates, credit rates, exchange rates, and asset prices. This paper examines the effectiveness of monetary policy in Turkey by focusing on interest rate pass-through outcomes by way of an interacted vector autoregressive (IVAR) approach. The results suggest that policy-led rate changes are fully transmitted to deposit and credit rates within eight months. Competition in the banking sector (as well as that sector’s liquidity and profitability), dollarization, exchange rate flexibility, inflation, and term structure all have a positive effect on interest rate pass-through; whereas regulatory quality, GDP growth, monetary growth, industrial growth, and capital inflows have a negative effect. Using various tests, we find that the effect of financial development and macroeconomic variables on interest rate pass-through is neither robust nor time-invariant.

AB  - This working paper was written by Soyoung Kim (Department of Economics and Seoul National University) and Kuntae Lim (Bank of Korea).This study empirically investigates the effects of monetary policy shocks on the exchange rate in six emerging countries (Korea, Thailand, the Philippines, Mexico, Brazil, and Colombia). VAR models are used, wherein sign restrictions on impulse responses are imposed to identify monetary policy shocks. The empirical model reflects the small open emerging economy features. The estimation period is the recent period in which these countries adopted inflation targeting and more flexible exchange rate regimes based on the experience of advanced countries. The main findings are as follows. First, various puzzles such as the “exchange rate puzzle,” “delayed overshooting puzzle,” and “forward discount bias puzzle” are frequently found in these countries. Second, more severe puzzles are found in these emerging countries than in small open advanced countries.

In transition economies, the question of whether monetary-policy variables affect output in the short run is open. In this paper, we examine the real effects of monetary policy in Russia, Ukraine, Belarus, and Kazakhstan using time-series methods. We find mixed evidence that money matters in these countries, although the effects are greater in Russia. Hence, we conclude that activist monetary policy will have only a limited scope in these countries in the near term. Journal of Comparative Economics 33 (3) (2005) 441–461.

AB  - This study examines the dynamic effects of monetary policy on investment of non-listed real sector firms in China. We employ proxy vector autoregression analyses to extract China's monetary policy surprises and use firm-level data to investigate the dynamic effects of monetary policy. Empirical findings show that unanticipated expansionary monetary policy prompts investment of China's non-listed real sector firms in the first year of monetary policy surprises but has no positive accumulative effect on investment in the fourth year, suggesting that monetary easing shifts firms' investment to an early date rather than increases investment permanently. Group-division results present discrepancies between state-owned and private firms and among firms with different sizes. Further analysis provides evidence that the effect of monetary policy on non-listed firms' investment relates to external finance rather than investment opportunities.

T2  - Bank of Israel Working Papers
AB  - This paper studies the effect of monetary policy on the Israeli consumer price index and its components using a Factor Augmented VAR approach. We identify shocks to two observable variables – the central bank's interest rate and the exchange rate. We find that most prices decline in response to an increase in the interest rate, so there is no "price puzzle". A shock to the interest rate has, at least for some time, an effect on relative prices due to a distinct effect on partial price aggregates of the CPI. Generally, price aggregates that are better correlated with macro factors, or that are characterized by serial correlation in the specific shocks tend to react more to a monetary shock. Housing and energy prices tend to react stronger to a shock in the interest rate. A shock to the exchange rate (depreciation) has a positive effect on all prices with prices of traded goods, energy and housing increasing more than other prices. Our findings suggest that the main transmission channel of monetary policy to prices is through the exchange rate.

AB  - The effectiveness of monetary policy critically depends upon how well the transmission mechanism functions, so that the desired impact on output and inflation is achieved. The purpose of this paper is to study the transmission mechanism of monetary policy by analyzing the impact on inflation and output during multiple indicator regime (1998-99 to 2014) in an emerging economy-India. The Inflation Targeting Regime is also briefly outlined alongwith the impact on output and inflation. Using quarterly data for the period 1997 to 2017, the paper uses weighted average call money market rate as a proxy for the policy rate and evaluates the strength of the interest rate channel. We use a conventional Structural vector auto regression (SVAR) methodology to evaluate the efficacy and show the impluse response functions. Our results find that changes in the policy rate impact output growth steeply with a lag of about two quarters and the impact on inflation is maximized after three quarters. The study concludes that the monetary policy in India has a significant impact on output and inflation in the short-to-medium-run. After the policy shock, the fall in the output growth rate is of greater magnitude than the fall in inflation.

The paper derives the loss function of a cooperative monetary policymaker and the optimal targeting rules. The model is a modified version of Clarida, Galí, and Gertler (JME, 2002). The key change is that we allow pricing to market or local-currency pricing and consider the policy implications of currency misalignments. (JEL E52, F31, F41)

The study adopted a simplified Ordinary Least Squared technique and also conducted the unit root and co-integration tests. The findings of the study showed that monetary policy have witnessed the implementation of various policy initiatives and has therefore experienced sustained improvement over the years. The result also shows that monetary policy had a significant effect on exchange rate and money supply while monetary policy was observed to have an insignificant influence on price instability. The implication of this finding is that monetary policy has had a significant influence in maintaining price stability within the Nigeria economy. The study concluded that for monetary policy to achieve its other macroeconomic objective such as economy growth; there is the need to reduce the excessive expenditure of the government and align fiscal policy along with monetary policy measure.

AB  - This paper studies the relationships between inflation, economic activity, credit, monetary policy, and residential property and equity prices in 17 OECD countries, using quarterly data for 1986-2006. Using a panel VAR, we find plausible and significant responses to a monetary policy shock. Shocks to asset prices have a positive, significant effect on GDP and credit after three to four quarters, whereas prices start to increase much later. We also consider the transmission of US shocks from the US to the other economies. While monetary policy shocks are transmitted internationally, other shocks are not, perhaps because of the form of coefficient restrictions used.

AB  - This paper revisits the well-known vector autoregressive (VAR) evidence on the real effects of uncertainty shocks by Bloom (2009, https://doi.org/10.3982/ECTA6248). We replicate the results in a narrow sense using EViews. In a wide sense, we extend his study by working with a smooth transition VAR framework that allows for business cycle-dependent macroeconomic responses to an uncertainty shock. We find a significantly stronger response of real activity in recessions. Counterfactual simulations point to a greater effectiveness of systematic monetary policy in stabilizing real activity in expansions.
