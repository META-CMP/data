AB  - In this paper, we set up a new Keynesian model with imperfect pass-through effect to explore the effect of monetary policy in Korea. Key parameter values are estimated with Kalman filtering and a maximum likelihood estimation method. In our model, inflation-targeting rule still dominates alternative monetary rules in welfare dimension.

TI  - The Lags of Monetary Policy

T2  - Economic Record
AB  - The length of the transmission lags from monetary pblicy to output has been the subject of much research over the years, but there are serious problems in isolating the lags with any precision. This paper uses a simple model of Australian output to estimate the length of the lags, and then examines how attempts to grapple with the estimation problems might change the results. We estimate that output growth falls by about one-third of one per cent in both the first and second years after a one percentage point rise in the short-term real interest rate, and by about one-sixth of one per cent in the third year. This implies an average lag of about five or six quarters in monetary policy's impact on output growth. Each of these estimates is, however, subject to considerable uncertainty. We discuss the implications for policy of these relatively long and uncertain lags. Finally, we find no evidence that the average lag from monetary policy to output growth has become any shorter in the 1990s.

T2  - Pacific-Basin Finance Journal
AB  - This paper examines the individual effect of the channels of monetary transmission (the asset price channel, the credit channel, the interest rate channel, and the exchange rate channel) in China using Impulse Response Separation Vector Auto Regression (IRSVAR) technique. The results are as follows: First, although China's market-oriented reform has been carried out for 40 years, the role of the neoclassical interest rate channel in the overall effect of monetary policy is still relatively low (31%). Second, although the relative role of the credit channel has declined, it remains, on average, the most important transmission channel (42%). It shows that there are still serious frictions in China's economy and that market-oriented reforms need to be further strengthened. Third, in general, the relative marginal role of asset price channels has risen significantly (20%), mainly because of the rapidly increasing wealth effect on households in China's stock and property markets. Since the exchange rate has been strictly controlled, the role of the exchange rate channel has always been unimportant (7%). These results have important policy implications: China has made progress to marketize the interest rate in the past years, however, it is necessary to further improve the comprehensive marketization mechanism, and the choice of the intermediate target of macro-prudential monetary policy should pay sufficient attention to the changes in asset prices.

TI  - Exchange Rate Changes and Inflation in Post-Crisis Asian Economies: Vector Autoregression Analysis of the Exchange Rate Pass-Through
AU  - Ito, Takatoshi
AU  - Sato, Kiyotaka
T2  - Journal of Money, Credit and Banking
AB  - Macro-economic consequences of large currency depreciations among the crisis-hit Asian economies varied from one country to another. Inflation did not soar after the Asian currency crisis of 1997–98 in most crisis-hit countries except Indonesia where high inflation followed a very large nominal depreciation of the rupiah. The high inflation meant a loss of price competitive advantage, a key for economic recovery from a crisis. This paper examines the pass-through effects of exchange rate changes on the domestic prices in the East Asian economies using a vector autoregression analysis. The main results are as follows: (i) the degree of exchange rate pass-through to import prices was quite high in the crisis-hit economies; (ii) the pass-through to Consumer Price Index (CPI) was generally low, with a notable exception of Indonesia; and (iii) in Indonesia, both the impulse response of monetary policy variables to exchange rate shocks and that of CPI to monetary policy shocks were positive, large, and statistically significant. Thus, Indonesia's accommodative monetary policy, coupled with the high degree of CPI responsiveness to exchange rate changes was an important factor in the inflation-depreciation spiral in the wake of the currency crisis.

AB  - The money supply can be changed in the economic system by the monetary methods; as a result it leads to a change in the values of the key macroeconomic parameters. The work estimates the influence of monetary policy on actual growth of prices per square meter of housing in the Republic of Kazakhstan with the help of factor-augmented vector autoregression model FAVAR, using a data set comprising 76 quarters for the period from 1994:01 to 2012:04. Most aspects of the model are defined from statistical data on the economy of the Republic of Kazakhstan. The increment rate of the CPI ratio, the index of actual effective exchange rate for a group of CIS and non-CIS countries (24 countries), the average monthly rated salary per one employee, the M3 money supply and rated house prices (1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th class of comfort) have been calculated. A comparative analysis of the consequences of monetary policy options for the Republic of Kazakhstan with data for the Russian Federation and Republic of Belarus, shows that monetary policy in the Republic of Kazakhstan meets the standards of the leading countries.

AB  - We assess the effect of the United States (US) and domestic monetary policies on emerging market economies (EMEs) using a panel factor-augmented vector autoregressive model. We find a US policy rate hike outstrips a tantamount hike in EME policy rates in its impacts on EMEs and discover that bond flows are more sensitive to interest rate differentials than are equity flows. Tighter global or EME-specific policy entails divergent responses of growth and inflation in EMEs: in particular, the output loss is greater in those EMEs with higher inflation. When US monetary policy tightens, bond and equity markets in EMEs are prone to outflows. Domestic policy alone is not enough to counteract the effects of global policy shocks on capital flows in EMEs.

TI  - Identifying the Effects of Monetary Policy Shock on Output and Prices in Thailand
AU  - Jiranyakul, Komain
AB  - This paper attempts to identify the effects of monetary policy shock on output and price level in Thailand during 2005Q1 and 2016Q2. Recently available policy rate is used as a monetary policy variable. The structural VAR methodology is employed to identify the monetary policy shock. To enhance the precision of the model specification, the short-run restrictions are imposed on the specified structural model of co-integrated variables to allow the levels of variables to interact simultaneously with each other. The results from the analysis of the structural model reveal that a shock to monetary policy drives cycles for both real GDP and the inflation rate.

AB  - Purpose This paper aims to examine the interrelationships of monetary policy's structural shocks, the real exchange rate and stock prices. Design/methodology/approach According to quarterly data, variables such as gross domestic product, consumer price index, the real exchange rate, stock price and monetary policy indices in the structural vector autoregressions model are estimated. These variables' volatility is attributed to other variables’ structural shocks separately, and analysis of variance tables for all variables is presented. Findings The results show that structural shock on the exchange rate does not affect the stock price, but the monetary policy's structural shock positively impacts the real exchange rate. Moreover, the real exchange rate and monetary policy's structural shocks have a negative impact on the stock price index. However, no significant effect is found pertain to the real exchange rate structural shock, statistically. Originality/value To the best of the authors’ knowledge, the current study model is relatively novel in developing countries, and the study sought strength to develop knowledge on the subject of the study.

AU  - Xiong, Weibo

T3  - Special Issue: CES 2010 & Special Issue: SBICCI
AB  - The People's Bank of China (PBC) has employed a range of different instruments in the implementation of its monetary policy over the past decades, so perhaps no single instrument would constitute an adequate representation of the monetary policy stance. We thus develop a new policy stance index, and examine it in an ordered probit model, which follows the studies by Gerlach (2004) and He and Pauwels (2008). The empirical results show that in a backward-looking model, monetary policy reacts to actual output growth; one the other hand, when deviations from trend levels are considered, the PBC concerns inflation most seriously. In a forward-looking model, when we examine the PBC's statements in its quarterly Monetary Policy Executive Report from 2001Q1 to 2010Q3, it seems that the PBC's assessment of the prospects for inflation plays a key role determining the PBC's monetary policy stance. Our conclusions suggest that the PBC is informally targeting inflation, although no explicit target has ever been announced to the public by the PBC.

T2  - Journal of International Economics
AB  - This paper analyzes optimal monetary policy in a small open economy featuring monopolistic competition and nominal rigidities. It shows that the utility-based loss function for this economy can be written as a quadratic expression of domestic inflation, output gap and real exchange rate. The presence of an internal monopolistic distortion and a terms of trade externality drives optimal policy away from domestic inflation targeting and affects the optimal level of exchange rate volatility. When domestic and foreign goods are close substitutes for each other, the optimal policy rule implies lower real exchange rate volatility than a domestic inflation targeting regime. The reverse is true when the elasticity of substitution between goods is low.

AB  - The introduction of digital price tags and e-commerce facilitates the implementation of price adjustments and thereby diminishes the degree of nominal rigidity in an economy. Is this phenomenon welfare-improving? We address this question using a multi-sector New Keynesian model with information frictions and dispersed beliefs. Increased price flexibility may decrease welfare through the dispersed belief channel and the amplified spillover effects. Dispersed beliefs create a novel channel through which the welfare cost of inflation in a sector increases with price flexibility, altering the optimal inflation index stabilization policy. A monetary policy that stabilizes the optimal inflation index mitigates this paradox.

AB  - This paper assesses the effect of monetary policy on investment in Russian regions. In the first stage of the research, we estimate the responses of regional investment to interbank market rate shocks using structural vector autoregressions. In the second stage, we estimate regression models using impulse responses as dependent variables and explanatory factors as independent variables. The regression calculations are performed using the Elastic Net regularisation technique. We find that regions with higher shares of manufacturing, agriculture, and construction are more responsive to monetary policy shocks. In addition, we identified the high importance of these sectors in explaining the different effects of monetary policy on investment. The results also show that the larger is the share of the mining and quarrying sector in the gross regional product (GRP) and the greater the imports to GRP ratio, the smaller is the absolute change in investment from a monetary policy shock.

AB  - We show that dispersion-based uncertainty about the future course of monetary policy is the single most important determinant of Treasury bond volatility across all maturities. The link between Treasury bond volatility and uncertainty about macroeconomic variables is much stronger than for the more traditional time series measures of macroeconomic volatility and adds beyond the information contained in lagged bond market volatility. Uncertainty about monetary policy subsumes the uncertainty about future inflation (consumer price index and the deflator) and economic activity (unemployment, real and nominal gross domestic product and industrial production). In addition, causality clearly runs one way: from monetary policy uncertainty to Treasury bond volatility.

T2  - Indian Growth and Development Review
AB  - Purpose – The purpose of this paper is to analyse the implications of sharply rising food prices for monetary policy in India and similar emerging economies at present. Design/methodology/approach – This paper uses analytical arguments from relevant macroeconomic literature and evidence from late 1960s US data to examine whether the 1970s stagflation was due to the OPEC price hike. It develops a two person (rich and poor), two commodity (food and non‐food) model to examine the impact of rising food prices on GDP, on measures of inflation, and on welfare, in the model. Findings – Previously neglected evidence indicates that stagflation (simultaneously rising unemployment and inflation) preceded the OPEC price hike. The model results indicate that when food prices rise, the GDP deflator falls relative to the consumer price index (CPI). Research limitations/implications – The impact of supply shocks should be investigated by carefully examining links between abnormal rainfall and weather and output and prices on commodity by commodity basis. Further, technical issues pertaining to construction of a composite CPI representative of the population need to be explored. Practical implications – Monetary policy in India (and similar emerging economies) should focus upon a population weighted CPI or some variant thereof. Social implications – High GDP growth should not lead to complacency, since when food prices are rising, the overall welfare impact may be negative. Originality/value – The model presented in this paper explains the sustained divergence in India, in recent years, between the CPI versus the GDP deflator measures of inflation. It also highlights a possible similar divergence between GDP and overall welfare.

The Ordinary Least Squares technique is used to evaluate the impact of monetary policy on economic growth. It is evaluated contractionary monetary policy is not fruitful to stimulate the economic growth. It is also concluded that the monetary authorities of Pakistan cannot control money supply changes although they are able to influence such changes.

AB  - This study investigated the impact of monetary policy shocks on industrial output in Nigeria using
restricted VAR (VECM) model and Granger causality test for the period 1970 to 2015. In doing this,
data on the manufacturing and solid minerals subsectors was used for the analysis. Results show
that contribution of manufacturing subsector to GDP responded positively to shocks in monetary
policy, commercial bank credit to industrial sector and exchange rates, while contribution of solid
minerals subsector to GDP responded positively to shocks in commercial bank credit to the
industrial sector and exchange rate after the first year. On the other hand, the causality test result
indicated a unidirectional causality running from monetary policy rate and exchange rate to the
contribution of manufacturing sector to GDP on the one hand, and commercial bank credit to the
industrial sector and exchange rate to the contribution of solid mineral sector to GDP on the other.
Recommendations included; proper evaluation by the central bank of Nigeria of the possible
responses of the different subsectors of the industrial sector in its decision regarding choice of
monetary policy channel; the need for extreme caution to be taken in the management of exchange
rate, and the need for CBN to do more to encourage commercial banks to allocate more of their
loans to small scale investors in the manufacturing sector.

TI  - What Prompts the People's Bank of China to Change Its Monetary Policy Stance? Evidence from a Discrete Choice Model
AU  - He, Dong

T2  - China & World Economy
AB  - In the present paper, we model the policy stance of the People's Bank of China (PBC) as a latent variable, and the discrete changes in the reserve requirement ratio, policy interest rates, and the scale of open market operations are taken as signals of movement of this latent variable. We run a discrete choice regression that relates these observed indicators of policy stance to major trends of macroeconomic and financial developments, which are represented by common factors extracted from a large number of variables. The predicted value of the estimated model can then be interpreted as the implicit policy stance of the PBC. In a second step, we estimate how much of the variation in the PBC's implicit stance can be explained by measures of its policy objectives on inflation, growth and financial stability. We find that deviations of CPI inflation from an implicit target and deviations of broad money growth from the announced targets, but not output gaps, figure significantly in the PBC's policy changes.

AB  - This paper employs vector autoregressive (VAR) models to measure the impact of monetary policy shocks on regional output in Indonesia. We find substantial cross-regional variation in policy responses in terms of both magnitude as well as timing. Our work adds to the existing literature by providing insights from a large developing country, viz. Indonesia, where monetary policy has both a national and a regional dimension. The results support previous findings that the differential regional effects of monetary policy are significantly related to sectoral composition (especially the share of manufacturing), providing evidence for the relevance of the interest rate channel of monetary policy. We also find that firm size contributes to these differences, providing evidence for the importance of the credit channel. As a whole, both types of channels appear to operate simultaneously in the decentralized Indonesian monetary policy and to impact on the real part of the regional economy.

TI  - Measuring the Dynamic Effects of Monetary Policy Shocks: A Bayesian FAVAR Approach with Sign Restriction
AU  - Amir-Ahmadi, Pooyan
AU  - Uhlig, Harald
AB  - We estimate the eﬀects of monetary policy shocks in a Bayesian factor-augmented vector autoregression (BFAVAR). We propose a novel identiﬁcation strategy of imposing sign restrictions directly on the impulse responses of large sets of variables. The key strength of our approach is the additional “bite” due to the diﬀerences in factor loadings across sets of time series representing, say, “prices” or “output”. As an important advantage, our procedure does not require a structural interpretation of the factors themselves or adding observables to the list of factors. We impose the conventional wisdom regarding the responses of prices, monetary aggregates, spreads and interest rates. In response to a one-standard deviation monetary policy shock, we ﬁnd a modest drop in industrial production, reverting within two years, a persistent decline in the CPI, and decreases in yield spreads. By contrast, a standard Cholesky decomposition identiﬁcation of a monetary policy shock implies a persistent increase in the CPI four years following the shock.

AB  - This study investigates the impact of monetary policy on renewable energy generation in Iran. It examines three types of renewable energy generation: total renewable energy generation; solid biomass and biogas energy generation; and the hydropower, solar, and wind group energy generation. The study uses the Kalman filter and vector autoregression (VAR) models to examine annual data from 1984 to 2016. The Kalman filter model showed that the money supply parameter moved with a steady trend, except for a sharp point during the Iran-Iraq War. A sharp point can be found for real interest rate parameter as well, although the time of global crisis and sanctions also affects this coefficient. The VAR model results indicate that only a shock to money supply can affect all the three renewable energy generation types.

AB  - This paper investigates the effects of various monetary policy instruments in China with the structural vector autoregression model. Empirical results are as follows. The effects of benchmark lending rate and short-term interest rate shocks are larger than those of reserve requirement ratio shocks. Nonpolicy shocks exert substantial effects on intermediate targets under a quantity-based policy framework. The size and effects of short-term interest rate shocks in recent years are large. Short-term interest rate shocks have strong effects on property prices. These results suggest that the new interest rate-based policy framework is more effective than the previous quantity-based policy framework.

AB  - We study the effect of monetary policy shocks on commodity prices. While most of the literature has found that expansionary shocks have a positive effect on aggregate price indices, we study the effect on individual prices of a sample of four commodities. This set of commodity prices is essential to understand the dynamics of the balance of payments in Colombia. The analysis is based on structural VAR models; we identify monetary policy shocks following Kim (1999, 2003) upon quarterly data for commodity prices and their fundamentals for the period from 1980q1 to 2010q3. Our results show that commodity prices overshoot their long run equilibrium in response to a contractionary shock in the US monetary policy and, in contrast with literature, the response of the individual prices considered is stronger than what has been found in aggregate indices. Additionally, it is found that the monetary policy explains a substantial share of the fluctuations in prices.

AB  - We study the responses of residential property prices, inflation and economic activity to monetary policy shocks in 18 countries in the period 1986-2008, using panel VARs in which we distinguish between groups of countries depending on their financial systems. The effect of monetary policy on property prices is only about twice as large as its impact on GDP. Using monetary policy to guard against financial instability by mitigating property-price movements thus has sizable effects on economic activity. We find that the financial structure influences the impact of monetary policy on GDP via credit and property prices.

AB  - We estimate the differential regional effects of monetary policy shocks by exploiting geographical heterogeneity in income across metropolitan areas in the United States. We ﬁnd that prices and employment in poorer areas react by more to monetary policy shocks. The results for prices hold for headline CPI and a wide range of narrower consumer expenditure categories within the CPI. The results are consistent with New Keynesian models that allow for a different share of hand-to-mouth consumers across regions or different elasticities of intertemporal substitution, but not with models in which regions have different slopes of the Phillips curve or different elasticities of labor supply. An increase in heterogeneity across metropolitan areas ampliﬁes the effect of monetary policy on prices and employment.

T2  - Macroeconomics and Finance in Emerging Market Economies
AB  - Since the food component has a large weight in the CPI basket and food inflation plays one of the main roles in determining the headline inflation in Iran, this paper looks at connections between monetary policy, currency crisis, sanction and food price. To examine the dynamics and asymmetric effects of these relationships, we employ quantile regression. Empirically, we show that the coefficients of monetary policy, exchange rate and currency crisis on the food prices in different quantiles are positive and significant. In most cases, we show that food prices in Iran are responsive to the price of oil.More importantly, the inflation of food is strongly linked to economic sanctions, and the effect is significant across all quantiles. To verify robustness, the food price model was estimated using ARDL model as an alternative. The present study came up with the same results when compared to quantile regression.Eventually, asymmetric effects at different quantiles were confirmed.

AB  - Standard structural VAR models and estimation using Romer and Romer (2004) monetary policy shocks show that, in samples after the 1980s, a contractionary conventional monetary policy shock generates smaller and sometimes perversely-signed impulse responses compared to earlier samples. Using insights from the central bank information effects literature, we show that the analyses producing these results suffer from an omitted variables problem related to forward-looking information emanating from Federal Reserve forecasts. Transmission of conventional monetary policy shocks takes on the standard signs, and is typically significant, once Fed forward-looking information is taken into account. This reconciliation does not follow from adding private sector forecasts to the estimation frameworks.

T2  - Journal of Financial Economics
AB  - We show significant US monetary policy (MP) spillovers to international bond markets. Our methodology identifies US MP shocks as the change in short-term Treasury yields around Federal Open Market Committee meetings and traces their effects on international bond yields using panel regressions. We emphasize three main results. First, US MP spillovers to long-term yields have increased substantially after the 2007–2009 global financial crisis. Second, spillovers are large compared with the effects of other events, and at least as large as the effects of domestic MP after 2008. Third, spillovers work through different channels, concentrated in risk-neutral rates (expectations of future MP rates) for developed countries, but predominantly on term premia in emerging markets. In interpreting these findings, we provide evidence consistent with an exchange rate channel, according to which foreign central banks face a trade-off between narrowing MP rate differentials or experiencing currency movements against the US dollar. Developed countries adjust in a manner consistent with freely floating regimes, responding partially with risk-neutral rates and partially through currency adjustments. Instead, emerging countries display patterns consistent with foreign exchange interventions, which cushion the response of exchange rates but reinforce capital flows and their effects in bond yields through movements in term premia. Our results suggest that the endogenous effects of currency interventions on long-term yields should be added into the standard cost-benefit analysis of such policies.

Results indicate that both speed limit and real exchange rate targeting can carry the isomorphic properties of optimal monetary policy over to the closed economy. In addition, neither nominal income growth targeting nor CPI inflation targeting replicates a commitment policy. These findings provide new implications for optimal monetary policy in an open economy.

TI  - Central Bank Communication and Monetary Policy Surprises in Chile
AU  - Pescatori, Mr Andrea
AB  - This paper assesses the quality of the CBC’s communication policy by looking at the predictability and effectiveness of monetary policy communications by the Central Bank of Chile (CBC). To do so, we construct indeces of monetary policy surprises for the three major communication channels of the CBC: the release of policy meetings’ statements, minutes, and monetary policy reports (IPoM). We assess monetary policy predictability and efficacy by looking at the size and time-evolution of monetary policy surprises associated with meeting statements and the impact of the above communication channels on asset markets. We find that, in general, the CBC’s has been effective in its forward guidance through its statements and IPoM. Policy actions are quite predictable, especially post the global financia crisis. The response of equity prices and the exchange rate to monetary policy surprises have the right sign but are not robust. We also find an asymmetric response of equity prices to minutes suggesting that market participants extract information on the status of the economy especially when minutes have a loosening effect. Finally, to look at the macroeconomic impact we find that a 100 bps monetary policy tightening shock implies a decline in economic activity (IMACEC) of about 2 pp. after one year, while the response of inflation is more muted.

AB  - The characteristics that distinguish most developing countries, compared to large industrialized countries, include: greater exposure to supply shocks in general and trade volatility in particular, procyclicality of both domestic fiscal policy and international finance, lower credibility with respect to both price stability and default risk, and other imperfect institutions. These characteristics warrant appropriate models. Models of dynamic inconsistency in monetary policy and the need for central bank independence and commitment to nominal targets apply even more strongly to developing countries. But because most developing countries are price-takers on world markets, the small open economy model, with nontraded goods, is often more useful than the two-country two-good model. Contractionary effects of devaluation are also far more important for developing countries, particularly the balance sheet effects that arise from currency mismatch. The exchange rate was the favored nominal anchor for monetary policy in inflation stabilizations of the late 1980s and early 1990s. After the currency crises of 1994–2001, the conventional wisdom anointed inflation targeting as the preferred monetary regime in place of exchange rate targets. But events associated with the global crisis of 2007–2009 have revealed limitations to the choice of CPI for the role of price index. The participation of emerging markets in global finance is a major reason why they have by now earned their own large body of research, but it also means that they remain highly prone to problems of asymmetric information, illiquidity, default risk, moral hazard and imperfect institutions. Many of the models designed to fit emerging market countries were built around such financial market imperfections, and few economists thought this inappropriate. With the global crisis of 2007–2009, the tables have turned: economists should now consider drawing on the models of emerging market crises to try to understand the unexpected imperfections and failures of advanced-country financial markets.

A monetary VAR documents that monetary policy has significant effects on firm creation. An analytically tractable model combining sticky prices and firm entry shows that entry alters the transmission of monetary policy innovations, acting much like a type of investment in more standard models. Monetary policy rules that offset the uncertainty of productivity shocks can raise the mean level of entry and thereby welfare, suggesting a new motivation for stabilization policy.

AB  - Central banks in emerging and developing economies (EMDEs) have been modernizing their monetary policy frameworks, often moving toward inflation targeting (IT). However, questions regarding the strength of monetary policy transmission from interest rates to inflation and output have often stalled progress. We conduct a novel empirical analysis using Jordà’s (2005) approach for 40 EMDEs to shed a light on monetary transmission in these countries. We find that interest rate hikes reduce output growth and inflation, once we explicitly account for the behavior of the exchange rate. Having a modern monetary policy framework—adopting IT and independent and transparent central banks—matters more for monetary transmission than financial development.

TI  - Interpreting the macroeconomic time series facts: The effects of monetary policy
AU  - Sims, Christopher A.
T2  - European Economic Review
AB  - Existing theory and evidence on the effects of monetary policy are reviewed. Substantial room for disagreement among economists remains. New evidence, based on multivariate time series studies of several countries, is presented. While certain patterns in the data consistent with effective monetary policy are strikingly similar across countries, others, particularly the tendency of interest rate increases to predict high inflation, are harder to reconcile with effective monetary policy.

T2  - Emerging Markets Finance and Trade
AB  - This paper proposes an innovative approach for analyzing the influence of external shocks on small open economies. This approach incorporates the role of large-country monetary policy coordination in influencing shocks and provides an empirical tool to analyze them. In the face of recent fluctuations in commodity prices, this new tool makes it possible to evaluate the influence on small countries of large-country policy coordination in response to these shocks. Based on an analysis of data from Mexico, such policies are found to provide better results for Mexico when Mexico's trade partners coordinated their responses.

TI  - The impact of financial inclusion on monetary policy in Nigeria
AU  - Mbutor, O.
T2  - Journal of Economics and International Finance
AB  - Financial inclusion is currently hot topic in policy spheres because of its potency in encouraging economic growth. And because it improves the sensitivity of aggregate demand to interest rate it has been argued to be useful for the success of monetary policy. However, little attention has been devoted to computing the exact effect of financial inclusion on monetary policy. This paper presents a simple model showing the impact of financial inclusion on monetary policy in Nigeria between 1980 and 2012. The result of the study supports the notion that growing financial inclusion would improve the effectiveness of monetary policy. However, the coefficient of the number of bank branches has the wrong sign and this is explained by the fact that, in opening branches, banks mainly pursue profits but not financial inclusion which is a policy objective, so that there are clusters of branches which are under-utilized while numerous locations which are considered not favourable for balance sheets are under-branched.

AB  - This study examined the effects of mobile money—a recent innovation in Uganda’s financial-sector landscape—on aggregate economic activity and other macroeconomic variables. We first estimated the long-run mobile-money demand function using vector error correction (VEC) techniques, distinguishing between balances and transfers/transactions. We then estimated the short-run effects of mobile money on selected macroeconomic variables using structural vector autoregressive (SVAR) methods. The results showed that mobile money had moderate positive effects on monetary aggregates, consumer price index, private-sector credit, and aggregate economic activity. Mobile money balances responded to changes in monetary policy instruments, signaling possible ameliorating effects for the conduct of monetary policy. Finally, the results showed that transactional motives related to mobile money had stronger macroeconomic effects than savings motives.

TI  - Effect of Monetary Policy Instruments on Stock Market Returns at Nairobi Securities Exchange
AU  - Machasio, Immaculate N.
AB  - The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of Monetary Policy Instruments on Stock
Markets in Kenya specifically at The Nairobi Securities Exchange Market using annual data
from 1998 to 2012. Causal Research Design was used to analyze data using Statistical Product
and Service Solutions (SPSS). The software was run using three monetary policy variables
including treasury bill rate, Money Supply(M1) and consumer price index (proxy for inflation)
on the Stock Market Returns (proxied by NSE 20 share price index).
The general result of the analysis showed a strong correlation between monetary variables and
Stock Market Returns. All the explanatory variables are positively related to Stock Market
returns except treasury bill rate which has a negative relationship with stock market returns.
Increase in CPI and Money Supply M1 causes a corresponding increase in Stock Market returns
whereas an increase in Treasury Bill Rate causes a decrease in Stock Market Returns. The study
has revealed that monetary policy has made significant influence over the prices of ordinary
equities in Kenya and thus effectively on the returns. This implies that the equities market has
significantly absorbed the monetary policy impulses and therefore the project confirms earlier
studies done on the same topic regarding effect of Monetary policy on stock markets.
It would be important therefore to consider monetary variables as an important factor in
determining stock market movements. Utmost care should be taken in designing monetary
policies as it has a direct impact on cash inflows into the capital market and on the stability of the
capital market and as such policy makers need to be aware of the need to encourage investors.

AU  - Saibu, O. M.
AU  - Nwosa, P. I.
AB  - This study examines the effects of monetary policy on sectoral output growth in Nigeria over the period 1986:1 to 2008:4. The study utilized an Autoregressive Distributed lag (ARDL) model and the findings showed that manufacturing sector is not sensitive to any of the monetary policy variables. In sharp contrast with manufacturing sector, agricultural sector is responsive to changes in interest rate only while service and wholesale/retail economic activities are responsive to exchange rate. Furthermore, interest rate and exchange rate are the major determinants of mining output growth while building/construction sector is more responsive to changes in exchange rate and bank credit. In general exchange rate is the most important and influential monetary policy measure in Nigeria. The study concludes that monetary policy will be more effective if the inherent differences in these sectors are factor in the design of policies in Nigeria.

T2  - International Journal of Economics and Finance Studies
AB  - Historically, research focusing on the money demand function developing economies (especially Eastern European transition economies) was a difficult undertaking because of under-developed financial systems and the unavailability of data. This study aims to assist in filling this gap in the literature by employing three different estimation techniques to estimate the M1 and M2 money demand functions for Hungary. The study uses quarterly data for an 18-year period, obtained from the IMF’s International Financial Statistics database. The results based on the bounds testing procedure as well as the other two approaches confirm that a stable, long-run relationship exists between the demand for money and its determinants. The results’ robustness is enhanced by the similarities between the results of the various approaches used in the study. The money demand function can therefore theoretically serve as a tool to measure the effect of monetary policy decisions and in determining what parameters of the money demand function to adjust in order to yield the required effects. It is suggested that, in the case of Hungary the M1 money demand function might be the most appropriate model on which monetary policy decisions should be based.

AB  - We study unconventional policy shocks and information shocks associated with central bank announcements in the U.S. While unconventional policy shocks capture the direct influence of announced monetary policy actions, information shocks are associated with central bank information conveyed with the announcement. To disentangle these two types of shocks, we impose sign restrictions on high frequency changes in interest rates and stock prices around announcements. We find that information shocks lead to persistent declines in the 10-year government bond yield, whereas the actual unconventional policy shock induces only small interest rate responses. We also find that expansionary output effects of unconventional monetary policy are to some extent counteracted by the information shock.

AB  - This paper examines periods of pronounced rises and falls of real house prices since 1970 in eighteen major industrial countries, with particular focus on the lessons for monetary policy. We find that real house prices are pro-cyclical - co-moving with real GDP, consumption, investment, CPI inflation, budget and current account balances, and output gaps. House price booms are typically preceded by a period of easing monetary policy, but then diminishing slack and rising inflation lead monetary authorities to begin tightening policy before house prices peak. In a careful reading of official reports, speeches, and minutes, we find little evidence that foreign central banks have reacted to past episodes of rising real house prices beyond taking into account their implications for inflation and output growth. However, central bankers have expressed a range of opinions in the more recent policy debate with some willing in certain cases to raise policy rates to try to stem current and future surges in asset prices while others favor moral suasion or a hands-off approach. Finally, we characterize the risks associated with house-price reversals. Although mortgage lenders in some countries have significant exposure to house prices, the balance of evidence suggests that this exposure does not, in and of itself, pose a significant risk to financial stability. Nevertheless, the co-movement of both property prices and default rates with the business cycle means that losses on mortgage lending are likely to be higher when banks' other lines of business are also performing poorly.

T2  - China & World Economy
AB  - The existing literature on macroeconomic policy research is mainly concerned with the impact of a single monetary or fiscal policy on China's macroeconomic fluctuations in a closed economy. However, the effect of a mix of monetary and fiscal policies has been neglected. This paper addresses this issue with an open economy dynamic stochastic general equilibrium model. It applies impulse-response and welfare analyses to explore the stabilization effect of various mixes of monetary and fiscal policies. The results show that the optimal monetary policy and fiscal policy mix varies in different cases. When government spending shocks happen, the aggressive fiscal policy and passive monetary policy would be the best choice. In contrast, for domestic interest rate shocks, foreign interest rate shocks, and foreign consumption shocks, the passive fiscal policy and aggressive monetary policy are more applicable. This article explains China's economic fluctuations and highlights the importance of mix of monetary and fiscal policies in the face of different shocks.

AB  - This paper studies the transmission of US monetary shocks across the globe by employing a high-frequency identification of policy shocks and large VAR techniques, in conjunction with a large macro-financial dataset of global and national indicators covering both advanced and emerging economies. Our identification controls for the information effects of monetary policy and allows for the separate analysis of tightenings and loosenings of the policy stance. First, we document that US policy shocks have large real and nominal spillover effects that affect both advanced economies and emerging markets. Policy actions cannot fully isolate national economies, even in the case of advanced economies with flexible exchange rates. Second, we investigate the channels of transmission and find that both trade and financial channels are activated and that there is an independent role for oil and commodity prices. Third, we show that effects are asymmetric and larger in the case of contractionary US monetary policy shocks. Finally, we contrast the transmission mechanisms of countries with different exchange rates, exposure to the dollar, and capital control regimes.

TI  - The puzzling effects of monetary policy in VARs: Invalid identification or missing information?
AU  - Kerssenfischer, Mark
T2  - Journal of Applied Econometrics
AB  - Standard vector autoregressions (VARs) often find puzzling effects of monetary policy shocks. Is this due to an invalid (recursive) identification scheme, or because the underlying small-scale VAR neglects important information? I employ factor methods and external instruments to answer this question and provide evidence that the root cause is missing information. In particular, while a recursively identified dynamic factor model yields conventional monetary policy effects across the board, a small-scale VAR identified via external instruments does not. Importantly, the discrepancy between both models largely disappears once the information set of the VAR is augmented via factors. This finding is comforting news for the recent monetary literature. Two leading empirical advances with different underlying assumptions—namely external instruments (applied to a factor-augmented VAR) and dynamic factor models (identified recursively)—find very similar effects of monetary policy shocks, cross-verifying each other.

AB  - Objective::The impacts of monetary arrangements on the general level of prices in the international financial literature has been theoretically considered by economists and has been a main part of empirical studies in recent years. Therefore, the main purpose of this paper is to investigate the effect of the survival of monetary systems on the degree of exchange rate pass-through in 19 MENA countries during the period of 1985-2020. Method: For this purpose, at first, the duration of monetary policy is estimated using the survival models approach, and in the next step, by Markov switching approach, low and high inflationary environments are extracted, and finally the empirical model of the research has been estimated by pooled mean group estimator (PMG) method. Results: At first, the survival and non-survival of monetary systems were estimated by using of parametric methods and different distributions, and then by Markov Switching model of inflationary environments in both calm and severe conditions for this group of Countries has been estimated and the years in which the countries were in two situations were identified. The results of estimating the empirical model showed that with the increase in the value of foreign currencies compared to domestic currencies, the cost of imports in terms of domestic currency increased in this group of countries, resulting in consumer goods prices as indirect effects. Exchange rate fluctuations also increase in the long run. On the other hand, the lag of error coefficient in the error correction model is -0.67, which indicates a relatively high short-term adjustment speed towards the long-run equilibrium value. Also, the marginal cost of production and the survival of monetary system arrangements in the short run have a significant effect on the growth rate of the consumer price index in the short run. Moreover, the results of model estimation in long-run indicated that two regimes of inflation environment for the countries of the Middle East and North Africa are considered as optimal conditions and the variable of inflation rate has a negative impact and gross fixed capital formation and the degree of openness of the economy has a negative impact and have had a significant effect on the survival of monetary systems in duration models. In addition, being in a low and high inflationary environment leads to a decrease in the rate of exchange rate pass-through or the transition effects of changes in the effective nominal exchange rate on the consumer price index of goods and services in this group of countries and the persistence of monetary systems intensifies this effect. Also, GGDP has a negative effect on the consumer price index of goods and services in the long run.

AB  - The effect of monetary policy on prices and output in any economy cannot be overlooked. This is germane given the implications on various macroeconomic outcomes. In doing this, the Fully Modified Ordinary Least Squares (FMOLS) method was deployed base on the preliminary findings to test the relationship for Nigeria. Findings revealed that money supply and exchange rate exhibit significant effect on prices and output, while monetary policy rate does not. Also, technological innovation and labour force significantly impacted output while gross fixed capital formation did not, Base on the findings, it is recommended that the central bank implement policies that will ease access to forex, stabilize the exchange rate and lessen the hassles for capital goods import, while regulating money supply and monetary policy rate to stabilize the economy.

AB  - The VIX, the stock market option-based implied volatility, strongly co-moves with measures of the monetary policy stance. When decomposing the VIX into two components, a proxy for risk aversion and expected stock market volatility ("uncertainty"), we find that a lax monetary policy decreases both risk aversion and uncertainty, with the former effect being stronger. The result holds in a structural vector autoregressive framework, controlling for business cycle movements and using a variety of identification schemes for the vector autoregression in general and monetary policy shocks in particular.

Les sacrifices consentis et les sueurs froides, tout ceci a-t-il finalement payé ? La réponse est négative : la croissance est positive mais insuffisante pour induire une baisse du chômage. Y compris aux États-Unis, où pourtant le chômage a baissé, le taux d’emploi ne se redresse pas. Au-delà de 2015, comme l’indiquent nos prévisions d’avril 2014 réunies dans ce volume, les perspectives ne sont pas meilleures. La situation durablement dégradée sur le marché du travail alimente les pressions déflationnistes et le débat sur le salaire minimum, réveillé en France récemment, s’inscrit dans cette logique. En situation de chômage élevé, le fonctionnement concurrentiel du marché du travail conduit à la réduction du salaire réel, c’est-à-dire du pouvoir d’achat. Pour sortir de la déflation qui s’annonce, tous les regards se tournent vers les banques centrales. Puisqu’elles ont comme mandat la stabilité des prix, elles sont donc obligées de tout mettre en oeuvre pour l’empêcher. Elles ont d’ailleurs montré une grande créativité ces derniers temps en ajoutant à leur arsenal des politiques monétaires non-conventionnelles … dont on va chercher encore pendant des années à caractériser les modes opératoires et analyser les impacts. Mais les banques centrales risquent de ne pas y arriver : ce qui fait la déflation c’est le chômage. Ce qui a fait le chômage, c’est l’austérité immédiate, quand les multiplicateurs budgétaires sont élevés. Compter sur la politique monétaire seule contre la déflation est insuffisant. Pour vraiment sortir de la déflation, il nous faut réduire rapidement le chômage, en recourant aussi à la politique budgétaire. C’est aussi ce que montre Mahito Uchida qui présente une analyse de la mise en oeuvre de « l’Abenomics » au Japon.

AU  - Aastveit, Knut Are

T2  - American Economic Journal: Macroeconomics
AB  - The responsiveness of house prices to monetary policy shocks depends on the nature of the shock—expansionary versus contractionary—and on local housing supply elasticities. These findings are established using a panel of 263 US metropolitan areas. Expansionary monetary policy shocks have a larger impact on house prices in supply-inelastic areas. Contractionary shocks are orthogonal to housing supply elasticities. In supply-elastic areas, contractionary shocks have a greater impact on house prices than expansionary shocks do. The opposite holds true in supply-inelastic areas. We attribute this to asymmetric housing supply adjustments.

T2  - Business & Management Studies: An International Journal
AB  - Shadow banks are financial mediators. There are maturity, credit, and liquidity transformation without access to central bank liquidity and public sector credit guarantees in their performance. The principle purpose of this study is to answer the question of the relationship between shadow banking and monetary policy, all financial activities that require a private or public payment guarantee other than traditional banking. This study analyses the short and long-term effects of national income, policy rate, CPI and money supply (M1) on shadow banking by using Panel ARDL method in selected ten countries throughout 2002-2016. The findings of the analysis point out that there is a short- and significant long-term relationship between the indicators discussed. Short-term PMG estimation results indicate that the long-term equilibrium will be reached over for approximately four years. Also, long-term PMG estimation results also pointed to the existence of a significant relationship between indicators, apart from national income. It is determined that the money supply and policy interest rate had a positive relation and the consumer price index had a negative relation with shadow banking.

AB  - This paper examines the conduct and the effects of Swedish monetary policy in the 1930's. Three major conclusions emerge from the study: (1) The conduct of monetary policy specifically the devaluation of the Swedish currency in 1931 and the subsequent program of price stabilization, had a major effect on the aggregative behavior of the Swedish economy in the 1930's. (2) The impact of the new fiscal policy was insignificant compared to the effects of monetary measures and international developments. (3) The framing of Swedish monetary policy in the 1930's was strongly influenced by Wicksell's norm of price stabilization and the recommendations of the old generation of monetary economists represented by Gustav Cassel and Eli Heckscher.

TI  - Regional Effects of Monetary Policy - ProQuest
AB  - A key element of this dissertation is the examination of the regional and state level
effects of monetary policy. The first essay compares two broad approaches to identifying the
monetary policy shocks that are used to estimate the regional effects of monetary policy. One
approach that has been used in the previous literature assumes that monetary policymakers
respond to shocks to regional personal income but do not respond directly to shocks to national
income. A second general approach assumes that monetary policymakers respond to shocks to
national income but do not respond directly to region-specific income shocks. This assumption
is based on descriptions of monetary policymaking that policymakers focus on the national
economy and use regional information as a gauge to measure the national economy. The results
show that the effects of monetary policy shocks on regional income differ across the two broad
approaches to identifying policy shocks. Therefore, assumptions about whether monetary
policymakers respond directly to regional shocks seem to matter for estimating the regional
effects of monetary policy.
In the second essay, the analysis of the effects of monetary policy is extended to the state
level. Using the same methods as in the first essay, we investigate whether responses of statelevel income to monetary policy differ from one state to another, whether responses of state-level
income differ from the region’s overall response, and whether the method of identifying policy
shocks matters. Comparisons of states’ responses to monetary policy shocks show that each
state’s response is sometimes quite different from the response of the other states in that region
and from the overall response of its region.
In the third essay, the robustness of the results in the first two chapters to the
specification of model and the use of alternative definitions of national output are examined.

TI  - Singapore's Unique Monetary Policy: How Does it Work?
AU  - Parrado, Eric
AB  - The Monetary Authority of Singapore, instead of relying on short-term interest rates or monetary aggregates as its monetary policy instrument, conducts policy by managing the trade-weighted exchange rate index (TWI). This paper investigates how this operating procedure actually works. For empirical purposes, it assumes the authorities follow a reaction function that aims the TWI at stabilizing expected inflation and maintaining output at potential. A partial adjustment mechanism is included to dampen the actual changes in the exchange rate. The estimates confirm that the major focus of monetary policy in Singapore is controlling inflation. The estimated changes in the TWI track the actual change relatively well, and the estimated parameters are as expected. Accordingly, they support the hypothesis that monetary policy in Singapore can be described by a forward-looking policy rule that reacts to both inflation and output volatility. The results suggest that Singapore`s monetary policy has mainly reacted to large deviations in the target variables, which is consistent with monetary policy`s medium-term orientation.

T2  - Economic Modelling
AB  - Understanding monetary policy transmission is crucial to making policy decisions and evaluating macroeconomic models and relevant theories. In this study, we identify monetary policy shocks by orthogonalizing policy rate changes with respect to economic forecast information and examine the responses of a comprehensive set of economic indicators in Korea over 2009–2018 period. We find that monetary policy transmission is effective across almost every sector in the economy, including production, expenditures, prices, interest rates, monetary aggregates, liquidity, and asset prices. In contrast with alternative measures for monetary policy innovation, abnormal responses such as output and price puzzles are not observed using our estimated monetary policy shocks. Private agents’ inflation expectations fall and economic outlook deteriorates after a contractionary monetary policy shock. We attribute these results to the fact that the instant release of economic forecasts along with policy decision announcements weakens the so-called information effect.

AB  - This paper explores the role played by monetary policy in promoting economic growth in the South African economy over the period 2000-2010. The study employs the Augmented Dickey-Fuller and Phillips Perron unit root tests to test for stationarity in the time series. The Johansen co-integration and the Error Correction Mechanism are employed to identify the long-run and short-run dynamics among the variables. The study shows that a long run relationship exists among the variables. Also, the core finding of this study shows that money supply, repo rate and exchange rate are insignificant monetary policy instruments that drive growth in South Africa whilst inflation is significant. The study therefore recommends that monetary policies should be used to create a favourable investment climate that attracts both domestic and foreign investments thereby promoting a sustainable economic growth. The government should also increase government spending on the productive sectors of the economy so as to promote economic growth as monetary policy alone is unable to effectively spur economic growth.

AB  - We assess the effects of monetary policy shocks on income and wealth inequality through direct inequality measures and by analyzing several transmission channels explored in recent literature. Furthermore, we analyze two additional channels: the Housing and the Fiscal channels. The methodology adopted is a Bayesian proxy SVAR using a high-frequency identification based on the external instruments approach. Our own policy shocks are constructed for this purpose. The results show that an expansionary monetary policy shock does not have a significant effect on income inequality due to the existence of opposite channels, whereas it increases wealth inequality mainly through the portfolio channel.

The results are consistent with a bank lending channel when the Bernanke-Blinder model is extended to include commercial paper and the spread between the loan and commercial paper rates. The results are robust to alternative monetary policy measures. However, stability tests indicate instability over the nonborrowed reserves operating regime. When the estimates excluded data for this period, there was little evidence of systematic movement in bank loans in the direction predicted by the bank lending channel.

AB  - This paper updates and extends Friedman's (1972) evidence on the lag between monetary policy actions and the response of inflation. Our evidence is based on UK and US data for the period 1953–2001 on money growth rates, inflation and interest rates, as well as annual data on money growth and inflation. We reaffirm Friedman's result that it takes over a year before monetary policy actions have their peak effect on inflation. This result has persisted despite numerous changes in monetary policy arrangements in both countries. Similarly, advances in information processing and in financial market sophistication do not appear to have substantially shortened the lag. The empirical evaluation of dynamic general equilibrium models needs to be extended to include an assessment of these models' ability to account for the monetary transmission lags found in the data.

AB  - An optimizing model, with a flexible-price sector and a sticky-price sector, is presented to analyze the effects of relative-price changes on inflation fluctuations. The relative price of the flexible-price good represents a shift parameter of the New Keynesian Phillips curve. The optimal monetary policy is to target sticky-price inflation, rather than a broad inflation measure. Although stabilizing the relative price around its efficient value is one of the appropriate goals of the central bank, stabilizing sticky-price inflation is sufficient for achieving this goal. An optimal monetary policy for a small open economy is also discussed.

AB  - This study sought to examine relative importance of the different channels of the monetary transmission mechanism in Zambia. Vector Autoregressive Methods are used to examine the strength of each channel of monetary policy, namely interest rate, Exchange rate, credit and asset price channels. Results indicate that the exchange rate and credit are effective channels of monetary policy transmission in Zambia. Further, the study shows that although the interest channel is working it is weak while the equity or asset price channel is not important. From a policy perspective, these results imply that Central Bank is required to continuously monitor developments in the credit and conditions in foreign exchange markets in order to design effective monetary policies. In addition, concerted efforts are needed towards enhancing the asset/equity price channel in Zambia to make monetary policy to be more effective.Keywords: Monetary Policy;, Transmission Channel, Central Bank, Zambia, VAR

AB  - The monthly consumer price index (CPI) is the most oft-cited measure of inflation and one of the most important and closely watched statistics in the US economy. It is an indicator of how well the Federal Reserve is doing in achieving and maintaining low inflation, and it also is used to determine cost-of-living adjustments for many government programs, collective bargaining contracts, and individual income tax brackets. Since 1995, the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) has been eliminating biases that cause the index to overstate inflation, and further changes will come in January 1999. These changes are expected to create a more reliable index and by 1999 will have lowered measured CPI inflation by more than half a percentage point. It is important that the CPI should measure inflation accurately or that the degree of bias be known. Changes to the index are inevitable as the BLS strives to maintain an accurate measure of inflation in our dynamic economy.

AB  - The paper evaluates the distributional effect of monetary policy. The empirical analysis is implemented for the USA, where the dynamics in income inequality is mainly driven by the variation in the top one percent of the income distribution. The paper uses the inequality measures that represent the whole income distribution. The distributive effect of monetary policy is evaluated in the cases of different frequency data. To identify a monetary policy shock, the paper applies the contemporaneous and the long run identification methods. In particular, a cointegration relation is determined among the considered variables and the vector error correction methodology is used for the identification. The obtained results indicate that contractionary monetary policy decreases income inequality. These results can have important implications for the design of policies to reduce income inequality by giving more weight to monetary policy.

The four-variables structural VAR methodology adopted in the study is successful in identifying monetary policy shocks and their effects for the Czech and Polish economies. The time-varying model is capable of detecting a change in the policy reaction function consistent with introduction of the floating exchange rate system and switching to short-term interest rate as the main policy instrument. The results indicate the dominant role of exchange rate in the monetary transmission mechanism.

If there are diverse economic conditions in different regions, then a unitary monetary policy cannot suit all. The purpose of this paper is to explore this issue further by breaking it down into two separate issues. First there is the more conventional way of considering the question, in terms of the effect of a particular interest rate change on regions experiencing different economic conditions. This requires a consideration of the nature and causes of regional economic disparities in the UK, and how these might be affected by particular interest rate changes. But there is further the question of how monetary policy is transmitted to the different regions. The possibility is considered that there may be regional differences in how a particular monetary policy is translated into different financial conditions in different regions. In other words there may be a regional dimension to the transmission process itself. The focus here will be on the regional structure of the financial sector and financial behaviour, and in particular the credit market. The argument is explored further with a comparison of Scottish and UK data. Dow S. C. et Montagnoli A. (2007) La transmission au niveau régional de la politique monétaire du Royaume-Uni, Regional Studies 41, 797–808. Les médias ont suscité quelques inquiétudes quant à la mise en oeuvre d'une politique monétaire ‘unique’ au R-U. Tout en remettant en question l'idée selon laquelle un ajustement donné du taux d'intérêt reflète parfaitement la transmission de la politique monétaire, on considère si, oui ou non, il existe des variations régionales de la transmission de la politique monétaire sous diverses conditions financières, et donc sous diverses conditions économiques, suivant la région. L'analyse laisse supposer que, tandis que la politique monétaire du R-U pourrait avoir l'impact le plus grand sur les régions centrales à court terme, l'impact le plus durable à long terme se ferait sur les régions périphériques. Une comparaison des données auprès de l'Ecosse et du R-U en fournit quelques preuves. Ecosse R-U Politique monétaire Economies régionales Dow S. C. und Montagnoli A. (2007) Die regionale Übertragung der britischen W ährungspolitik, Regional Studies 41, 797–808. In den Medien ist Kritik an einer ‘gleichmacherischen’ Währungspolitik für Großbritannien laut geworden. Wir stellen die Annahme in Frage, dass eine gegebene Zinssatzänderung vollständig wiedergibt, wie Währungspolitik übertragen wird, und ziehen die Möglichkeit in Betracht, dass es regionale Unterschiede dabei geben kann, wie die Währungspolitik in verschiedenen Regionen in verschiedene finanzielle (und somit wirtschaftliche) Bedingungen übersetzt wird. Aus der Analyse geht hervor, dass sich die britische Währungspolitik zwar kurzfristig am stärksten auf die zentralen Regionen auswirkt, langfristig aber in den peripheren Regionen eine größere und nachhaltige Wirkung zeigt. Belege hierfür liefert ein Vergleich von Daten aus Schottland und Großbritannien. Schottland GB Währungspolitik Regionalwirtschaften Dow S. C. y Montagnoli A. (2007) La transmisión regional de la política monetaria británica, Regional Studies 41, 797–808. En el Reino Unido la política monetaria con un enfoque único para todos ha suscitado preocupación en los medios de comunicación. Cuestionando la suposición de que un determinado cambio en la tasa de interés refleja totalmente el modo en que se transmite la política monetaria, consideramos la posibilidad de que podrían existir diferencias regionales en cuanto a cómo se traduce en diferentes regiones la política monetaria en distintas condiciones financieras. Este análisis indica que si bien la política monetaria británica podría tener a corto plazo una mayor influencia en las regiones centrales, se observa una mayor repercusión sostenida a largo plazo en las regiones periféricas. Como ejemplo comparamos datos escoceses y británicos. Escocia GB Política monetaria Economías regionales

AB  - We investigate the transmission mechanism of monetary policy in China over the past decades with emphasis on the post-Asian crisis period. A factor-augmented VAR method is used to study the effectiveness of monetary policy instruments in stabilizing the Chinese economy. We find that repo rate, benchmark lending rate, and a market-based monetary stance have little impact on the Chinese economy, and are only mildly effective when the exchange rate is more market-determined. The non-market-based measures of People's Bank of China, such as growth rates of total loan and money supply, are effective in adjusting the real economy and price level. Given the slow pace of exchange rate reform, China is likely to continue employing non-market-based policies in the near future.

Among them is the likelihood that the economies of member countries will respond differently to the (common) actions of the European Central Bank. This paper seeks to draw lessons for the EMU by studying the size and sources of differential responses to monetary policy shocks in the U.S. states and regions.1

AB  - We examine the effects of monetary and macroprudential policies in the Asia-Pacific region, where many inflation targeting economies have adopted macroprudential policies in order to safeguard financial stability. Using structural panel vector autoregressions that identify both monetary and macroprudential policy actions, we show that tighter macroprudential policies used to contain credit growth also have a significant negative impact on macroeconomic aggregates such as real GDP and the price level. The similar effects of monetary and macroprudential policies may suggest a complementary use of the two policies at normal times. However, they could also create challenges for policymakers, especially during times when low inflation coincides with buoyant credit growth.

AB  - The shadow banking system in China has its own characteristics compared to conventional commercial banks and the foreign shadow banking system. Its emergence is important to the economic development and financial system in China. However, it also challenges the implementation of monetary policy and regulation. China is in the economic shunt period and their monetary policy system is somewhat lagging behind the advanced economic system. This paper is therefore designed to figure out the impacts of the shadow banking system on monetary policy. After analysis of SVAR model, OLS regression, trend graph and correlation coefficient, results show that an increase in the growth rate of the shadow banking system would affect the monetary policy by increasing money supply and the value of CPI. Moreover, the implementation of easy or tight monetary policy by increasing or decreasing the benchmark interest rate would not be able to achieve the original goals due to the activities of the shadow banking system. It is suggested that the Chinese authorities should follow the market requirement to improve the monetary policy system by means of supervision and regulation on the shadow banking system which would the monetary policy effect.

AB  - Given the high fluctuations of the general price level, the importance of investment, and accessing sufficient financial resources, we examine the effects of monetary policy on the nominal (Inflation) and real (Investment) sectors of a developing economy, like Iran, through the channel of the relationship between bank deposits, stock market, and speculation in the foreign exchange market (FEM). For this purpose, due to regime switching in Iran’s economy, the non-linear relation between the variables has been investigated by applying Markov switching models and annual data of 1988–2018. The results show that the financial intermediaries (FIs) have not had a complementary relationship in both bear and bull market and high and low banks deposits regimes. Both FIs have negatively impacted speculation in the FEM in high and low exchange rates difference regimes. The difference between official and unofficial exchange rates negatively impacted the FIs in bear market and low banks deposits regimes; on the contrary, a positive effect in a bull market and high bank deposits. The effects of both FIs on investment have been positive in high and low investment regimes and negative on inflation rates in high and very high inflation regimes. In comparison, the impact of speculation in the FEM has been negative on investment and positive on inflation. Therefore, in the event of the lack of limitations regarding using interest rate (IR) and the policy of exchange rate unification, the central bank would be able to affect the nominal and real sectors of the economy suitably through the channels of the FIs and the FEM.

AB  - We analyze the performance and robustness of some common simple rules for monetary policy in a New-Keynesian open-economy model under different assumptions about the exchange rate model. Adding the exchange rate to an optimized Taylor rule (that responds to CPI inflation) gives only small improvements in terms of economic stability in most model configurations. The Taylor rule is also slightly more robust to uncertainty about the exchange rate model than are rules that respond to the rate of exchange rate depreciation. Our results thus indicate that the Taylor rule is sufficient to stabilize a small open economy, also under exchange rate model uncertainty.

AU  - Ahmadi, Pooyan Amir

AB  - In this paper we estimate the effects of monetary policy shocks in a Bayesian Factor-Augmented vector autoregression (BFAVAR). We propose to employ as an identiﬁcation strategy sign restrictions on the impulse response function of pertinent variables according to conventional wisdom, namely prices, monetary aggregates, spreads and interest rates. The key strength of our factor based approach is that sign restrictions can be imposed on many variables in order to pin down the impact of monetary policy shocks. Thus an exact identiﬁcation of shocks can be approximated and monitored. We ﬁnd that our factor generalization of the sign restriction approach outperforms the competing Cholesky identiﬁcation, is robust across different subsamples and monetary regimes avoiding anomalies present in Cholesky identiﬁcation such as an unreasonable ”prize puzzles” by construction .

TI  - On the Liquidity Effect of Monetary Policy in the CEMAC Countries: An Empirical Investigation
AU  - Samba, Michel Cyrille
T2  - International Journal of Economics and Finance
AB  - The aim of this paper is to investigate on the effectiveness of the liquidity effect of monetary policy actions in the CEMAC region. As the conventional wisdom states, a cornerstone for the central bank to stimulate the economy is to lower interest rates by increasing the supply of narrow money. To circumvent some of the difficulties inherent to the verification of this assumption, we adopt in this study, a methodology advocated by Christiano and Eichenbaum(1991) which seems appropriate in the special case of the CEMAC countries. The results we obtain indicate that the conventional wisdom holds both on individual level and on a regional basis when the monetary aggregate measures the stance of monetary policy. Moreover, an unanticipated credit expansion causes the interest rate to decline in most of the CEMAC countries. However, both the liquidity effect and the loanable effect are offset most of the time by a price puzzle or an output puzzle. In some countries, there is also an evidence of a liquidity puzzle. On the other hand, identification assumptions based on the interest rate are unsuitable for an appropriate assessment of the liquidity effect in the region.

TI  - Monetary Policy and Inflation: Is there a Neo- Fisher Effect? Evidence from Inflation Targeting Countries in Central and Eastern Europe
AU  - Cuza, Alexandru Ioan
AB  - In this study we empirically investigate the influence of the low interest rate environment adopted by inflation targeting countries from Central and Eastern Europe as a rescue measure after the outbreak of the financial crisis. Moreover, we focus on examining the existence of a NeoFisher effect that may explain the positive relation between interest rates and inflation, with causality from interest towards inflation rate. We employ a Vector Autoregressive model, together with an impulse response analysis and a variance decomposition technique, to capture the response of economic growth and inflation to shocks to the monetary policy. Our main results point to a negative relation between policy rates and economic growth, as predicted by the economic literature. However, results show a significant positive relation between interest rates and inflation, meaning that negative shocks to interest rates lead to lower inflation. Also, we find that the response of inflation and economic growth is the same, regardless of the crisis or non-crisis period.

AB  - This thesis paper proposes a structural VAR model to identify monetary policy influence in the transition period for the Czech Republic and Poland. The analysis of the impulse responses and the variance decompositions puts forward the significant, especially for Poland, though transitory, role of the monetary policy for the fluctuations of output. The non-trivial importance of the exchange rate in explaining price level fluctuations, on one hand; and the significant monetary reaction to exchange rate and foreign interest rate movements, on the other; emphasizes the exchange rate as a significant transmission mechanism. External influences are identified as an important source for the variation in output, prices and exchange rates for the two countries.
