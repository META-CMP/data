TI  - Monetary Policy: Goals and Strategy
AU  - Yellen, Janet L.
T2  - Business Economics
AB  - In addition to a primary long-term goal of price stability, monetary policy should aim to stabilize output and employment. A managing strategy might include adjusting the federal funds rate above an equilibrium rate by an amount that depends on the deviation between actual and potential output and between actual and targeted inflation. While such a rule could provide a useful benchmark, flexibility in managing policy is required. While the Federal Reserve Act is not seriously flawed, reforming it to provide an improved framework for the Federal Reserve to specify its strategy to attain legislated goals would be desirable. However, focusing on price stability alone would be a cause for concern.

TI  - Does Importing More Inputs Raise Productivity and Exports? Some Evidence from Indian Manufacturing
AU  - Sharma, Chandan
T2  - SSRN Electronic Journal
AB  - This study aims to analyse the role of imported inputs on productivity and export performance of the manufacturing industries of India. Our results indicate that imported inputs are crucial determinates of Total Factor Productivity (TFP). However, the impact varies greatly across industries. Furthermore, results regarding research and development (R&D) intensity suggest that inhouse R&D activities do not play a significant role in the productivity performance of Indian manufacturing firms. Our results also indicate that imports lead to a substantial growth in exports. In particular, exports in the chemical, machinery and transport equipment industries are highly dependent on imported intermediate goods. The results also indicate that although R&D is not linked with the productivity of industries, it has an important role in the export performance of these industries. TFP is also estimated to have a significant and sizable impact on export performance. This, in turn, supports the self-selection hypothesis, which explains the self-selection of more productive firms into the export market. Overall, our results support both hypotheses: learning by importing and self-selection in the import market.

TI  - Impact of Supply of Money on Food and General Price Indices: A Case of Pakistan
AU  - Khan, Rana Ejaz Ali
AU  - Gill, Abid Rashid
AB  - The paper probed the impact of supply of money on food and general price indices by estimating a series of equations taking CPI food, CPI general, WPI food, WPI general, GDP deflator and SPI as measures of inflation and M1, M2 and M3 supply of money as explanatory variables. For analysis, OLS technique is used covering time series data for the years 1975-76 to 2006-07 that was made stationary by Durbin-Watson criterion. AR (1) is used to check autocorrelation. The results for CPI food, CPI general, WPI general, GDP deflator and SPI show that they are negatively related with M1 supply of money. CPI food, CPI general, WPI general, GDP deflator, and SPI are also negatively related with M2 supply of money. The results show that CPI food, CPI general, WPI general, GDP deflator and SPI are positively related with M3 supply of money. It may be concluded that supply of money M1 and M2 affects the food and general indices in the same way. However, M1 supply of money affects the CPI general strongly than CPI food.

T3  - The Role of Financial Intermediaries in Monetary Policy Transmission
AB  - Monetary policy can have an impact on economic and financial stability through the risk taking of banks. Falling interest rates might induce investment into risky activities. This paper provides evidence on the link between monetary policy and bank risk taking. We use a factor-augmented vector autoregressive model (FAVAR) for the US for the period 1997–2008. Besides standard macroeconomic indicators, we include factors summarizing information provided in the Federal Reserve’s Survey of Terms of Business Lending (STBL). These data provide information on banks׳ new loans as well as interest rates for different loan risk categories and different banking groups. We identify a risk-taking channel of monetary policy by distinguishing responses to monetary policy shocks across different types of banks and different loan risk categories. Following an expansionary monetary policy shock, small domestic banks increase their exposure to risk. Large domestic banks do not change their risk exposure. Foreign banks take on more risk only in the mid-2000s, when interest rates were ‘too low for too long’.

AU  - Kaur, Simranjeet
T2  - Vision
AB  - This article presents a systematic literature review spanning the decade of 2010?2020 in a thematic fashion. It provides an in-depth analysis of how monetary policy regimes are responding to food inflation. It discusses about factors driving food inflation and the manner in which efficiency of financial markets facilitate policy transmission. Further, it explains how food insecurity is exacerbated by rise in food prices and the way high-income countries protect their farmers through input subsidies, indirectly contributing to global food price hike. It also argues that a strong monetary policy credibility can lend stationarity and mean-reversion to inflation rates. Next, it discusses the issues faced by central banks in measurement of inflation such as conflict of choice in different inflation measures and supply side constraints ranging from high farm-to-fork mark-ups to cartelization and hoarding. In subsequent section, it deals with the question whether to target headline or core inflation. After that, it presents a snapshot of various advanced and emerging countries operating their monetary policy in the presence of fiscal policy. It illustrates that the degree of fiscal intervention should be decided according to individual threshold of every country, taking into account the proportion of Ricardian and non-Ricardian population.

Agents are aware of the possibility of regime changes and their beliefs have an impact on the law of motion of the macroeconomy. The results show that the '60s and the '70s were characterized by a prolonged period of active fiscal policy and passive monetary policy. The appointment of Volcker marked a change in the conduct of monetary policy, but it took almost ten years for the fiscal authority to start accommodating this regime change.

AB  - In this paper we review the history of deflation in China, Japan, and the United States, and summarize the stylized empirical facts regarding deflation and key real and monetary variables in these economies. Based on a review of the institutional background of deflation in these economies, we argue that deflation in China is largely supply-led, whereas deflation in Japan is demand-led. We discuss the adverse effects of demand-led deflation, and argue that deflation is not simply inflation in reverse. Based on these adverse effects, we explain the basis of a discontinuity in the monetary policy process, and contrast the discontinuity process with the 1930s-era liquidity trap concept. We then provide empirical evidence on an important link in the discontinuity process: the effect of demand-led deflation on money demand. We consider a variety of money demand function estimates for Japan, China, and the United States in order to illustrate that deflation in Japan may have indeed contributed to a discontinuity in monetary policy by shifting the demand for money upward, and we then suggest several implications for central bank policy in a deflationary environment.

AB  - Many studies estimate a shadow interest rate, which can be negative when the short-term rate is at the zero lower bound, and use it as the monetary policy indicator. This study proposes a novel method to estimate the shadow rate using survey forecasts of macroeconomic variables and allowing the shadow rate to be negative even when the short-term rate is positive. The estimated U.S. shadow rate remained negative in 2015-17, when the Federal Reserve continued to hike its policy rate but kept its holdings of assets at sizable levels. The shadow spread, which is defined as the shadow rate minus the short-term rate, is negatively correlated with the Federal Reserve’s holdings of assets, particularly mortgage-backed securities. The impact of the unconventional monetary policy on inflation was 0.5 percentage points at its peak.

Estimating several Vector Autoregressions on US data over the period 1982:2–2005:4 we identify five structural shocks: a multi-factor productivity shock; an investment-specific technology shock; a monetary policy shock; and a fiscal revenue and spending shock. Together these shocks can account for the deterioration and subsequent reversal of the trade balance in the 1980s. While productivity improvements and fiscal and monetary policy easing also play an important role in the rapid deterioration since 2000, these structural shocks cannot explain why the trade balance deteriorated in the second half of the 1990s.

TI  - Monetary Policy with Very Low Inflation in the Pacific Rim
AU  - Ito, Takatoshi
AU  - Rose, Andrew K.
AB  - Extremely low inflation rates have moved to the forefront of monetary policy discussions. In Asia, a number of countries—most prominently Japan, but also Taiwan and China—have actually experienced deflation over the last fifteen years. Monetary Policy with Very Low Inflation in the Pacific Rim explores the factors that have contributed to these circumstances and forecasts some of the potential challenges faced by these nations, as well as some potential solutions. The editors of this volume attribute low inflation and deflation in the region to a number of recent phenomena. Some of these episodes, they argue, may be linked to rapid growth on the supply side of economies. Here, inadequate demand policy can produce what is referred to as a "liquidity trap" in which the expectation of falling prices encourages agents to defer costly purchases, thereby discouraging growth. Low inflation rates can also be traced to the presence of a "zero-lower bound" on interest rates, as well as the inflation-targeting phenomenon. Targets have been set so low, the editors argue, that in some cases a few bad shocks lead to deflation.

AU  - Oppedahl, David B
AB  - This article uses impulse response functions based on a vector autoregressive model of the U.S. economy to analyze how oil price shocks move through major channels of the economy to affect inflation. The model represents the interactions between oil prices, real GDP, a monetary aggregate, short-term interest rates, the spread between long- and short-term interest rates, and the GDP deflator for the period 1970 through 1994. The responses of the model to monetary and interest rate shocks generally conform to economic theory. The analysis shows that oil price shocks have permanent effects on the price level and nominal GDP. These findings suggest that during the estimation period, monetary policy generally accommodated the inflationary pressure of oil price shocks.

AB  - This study investigates whether the effects of monetary policy are amplified by its impact on bank balance-sheet strength. Or, in other words, it tests whether the bank-lending channel of the monetary transmission mechanism, as reformulated by Disyatat (2011), works. To this end, panel vector autoregressions with high-frequency identification and univariate panel regressions are applied to data for Poland. Counterfactual exercises show that the analyzed channel accounts for about 23% of a decrease in lending following a monetary policy impulse. This is another piece of evidence showing that the financial accelerator works in both the nonfinancial and the financial sector. In some cases it can make the interplay between monetary and macroprudential policy nontrivial.

Uncertainty about government debt has a large and persistent effect on output, consumption, investment, consumer confidence, and business confidence. Uncertainty about tax changes also has detrimental consequences for real activity but the effect of spending and monetary policy uncertainty appears to be small. About 25% of output fluctuations are accounted for by policy uncertainty, with government debt making the largest contribution at longer horizons.

AU  - Istiak, Khandokar

T2  - International Journal of Finance & Economics
AB  - The current mainstream approach to monetary policy in the United States is based on the new Keynesian model and is expressed in terms of the federal funds rate. It ignores the role of financial intermediary leverage (or collateral rates). But as the federal funds rate has reached the zero lower bound, the issue is whether there is a useful role of leverage in monetary policy and business cycle analysis. Motivated by these considerations and by recent financial intermediary asset pricing theories in this paper, we investigate the macroeconomic effects of broker–dealer leverage and the interdependence between monetary policy and broker–dealer leverage in the context of a structural vector autoregression model, using quarterly U.S. data over the period from 1967:1 to 2014:3. We address the simultaneity problem of identifying monetary policy and leverage shocks by using a combination of short-run and long-run restrictions. We also use the sign restriction approach to the identification of shocks to distinguish between leverage supply and leverage demand shocks, as one would expect the macroeconomic effects of these two types of leverage shocks to be quite different. Our results show that monetary policy and broker–dealer leverage demand shocks produce results that capture reasonable macroeconomic dynamics.

The results indicate that all of these factors played a role, but that the major explanation is disruption in financial intermediation, largely operating through the impact of changes in domestic asset prices on bank lending.

AB  - Rising oil prices appear to retard aggregate U.S. economic activity by more than falling oil prices stimulate it. Past research suggests adjustment costs, financial stress, and/or monetary policy may be possible explanations for the asymmetric response. This paper uses a near vector autoregressive model of the U.S. economy to examine where the asymmetry might originate. The analysis uses counterfactual experiments to determine that monetary policy alone cannot account for the asymmetry.

AB  - Do econometricians have to use quarterly data in GDP-interest rate regressions, even though interest rates are observable daily? Do economic agents take decisions at the frequency of data sampling? In this paper, we start from the point that the answers to those two questions are no and no, while the literature on monetary policy identiﬁcation and modelling implicitly answers yes and yes. In the ﬁrst part of this paper, we provide new evidence on the dynamic response of the economy to monetary policy shocks. More precisely, we propose a new VAR representation that mixes data of diﬀerent sampling frequency in a simple and tractable way. We show that the dynamic response of the economy is similar to the one generally estimated in the literature, provided that our results rely on more plausible restrictions for identiﬁcation. In the second part of the paper, we show that the popular ”limited participation” model does not ﬁt the new evidence we provide, unless we allow for unrealistically infrequent portfolio reallocation.

AU  - Durai, S.   Raja Sethu
AU  - Ramachandran, M.
T2  - Macroeconomics and Finance in Emerging Market Economies
AB  - This paper makes an attempt to measure sacrifice ratios for the farm and non-farm sector as disinflation policy is believed to have differential impact on these sectors. Using the non-parametric approach of Ball (1994), five disinflation episodes are identified for India over the period from 1950–51 to 2009–10. These disinflations are largely due to contractionary monetary policy pursued by the Reserve Bank of India. The estimates of the sacrifice ratio and the presence of persistence and hysteresis effects indicate that disinflationary monetary policy is more harmful to output growth in the non-farm sector. In contrast, the negative sacrifice ratio in the farm sector implies that there is output gain during disinflationary periods. This output gain in the farm sector seems to have been driven by those factors which are independent of contractionary monetary shocks. These evidences also suggest that use of aggregate time series data might produce errors in the measurement of sacrifice ratios.

AB  - The Bank of Japan is running an unprecedented historic experiment by doubling its already record high monetary base to more than 50 % of GDP over the next 2 years. The aim is to escape from deflation and achieve 2 % inflation. This chapter questions the main assumptions underlying the new monetary policy: (1) There is little evidence that deflation is a major obstacle to Japan’s prosperity. (2) Japan does not seem to be suffering from insufficient demand. (3) It is not clear how the BoJ can control inflation expectations. (4) Even if it succeeds, it will face the challenge of controlling the negative side effects of rising nominal interest rates, an accelerating velocity of money, lower real wages and a devaluation of the yen that may spur a currency war.

AU  - Verlinden, Johan
AB  - This paper focuses on the importance of fiscal policy rules for the conduct of monetary policy in the euro area, building upon the idea that monetary and fiscal policy should not be conducted in isolation. We derive a fiscal closure rule for the euro area that is consistent with the requirements of the Maastricht Treaty and the Stability and Growth Pact. We show that incorporating this fiscal closure in a simple Vector AutoRegression (VAR) system indeed seems to affect monetary policy in the euro area.

TI  - Inflation Targeting Monetary Policy and Macroeconomic Performance: The Case of Middle-Income Countries
AU  - Fosu, Richard
AB  - The number of studies investigating the effects of inflation targeting (IT) on inflation and macroeconomic variables has increased with the rising number of countries adopting IT. The empirical evidence has, however, failed to converge. In line with the need for more such studies, this paper uses a difference in differences (DID) model with dynamic panel fixed effect and instrumental variable (IV) techniques to estimate the effect of IT on inflation and economic growth for a sample of 40 middle-income countries. Generally, we find that the effects of IT on inflation is quantitatively large but statistically insignificant. We, however, find strong evidence that IT leads to higher growth in middle-income countries.

TI  - The rise in nonbank finance and monetary policy transmission
T2  - CEPR
AB  - Some have speculated that the rise in nonbank financing has weakened the transmission mechanism of monetary policy. This column used international data to investigate this claim. Overall, the evidence suggests that nonbanks tend to respond more strongly to monetary policy than banks. Although monetary policy remains potent in an environment with more nonbank intermediation, it will need to continuously adapt to changes in the transmission mechanism.

TI  - Price and Monetary Dynamics Under Alternative Exchange Rate Regimes
AU  - Bleaney, Mr M. F.
AB  - According to theory, inflation persistence should have less variance across countries under pegged than floating exchange rates, but not necessarily a lower mean. The paper tests this prediction on postwar data for OECD countries. After allowing for the upward bias to persistence estimates created by shifts in mean inflation, the paper finds persistence has a greater spread (but not a higher mean) in the floating-rate period, as predicted by theory. Monetary growth has been much less accommodative of inflation under floating rates, most probably because of the shifts in monetary policy rather than those in exchange rate regime.

AB  - We examine empirically whether asset prices and exchange rates may be admitted into a standard interest rate rule, using data for the United States, the United Kingdom, and Japan since 1979. Asset prices and exchange rates can be employed as information variables for a standard “Taylor-type” rule or as arguments in an augmented interest rate rule. Our empirical evidence, based on measures of the output gap proxied by marginal cost calculations, suggests that monetary policy-makers may use asset prices and exchange rates not only as part of their information set for setting interest rates, but also to set interest rates to offset deviations of asset prices or exchange rates from their equilibrium levels. These results are open to several alternative interpretations.

AU  - Benati, Luca
AU  - Mumtaz, Haroon
AB  - We fit a Bayesian time-varying parameters structural VAR with stochastic volatility to the Federal Funds rate, GDP deflator inflation, real GDP growth, and the rate of growth of M2. We identify 4 shocks-monetary policy, demand non-policy, supply, and money demand-by imposing sign restrictions on the estimated reduced-form VAR on a period-by-period basis. The evolution of the monetary rule in the structural VAR accords well with narrative accounts of post-WWII U.S. economic history, with (e.g.) significant increases in the long-run coefficients on inflation and money growth around the time of the Volcker disinflation. Overall, however, our evidence points towards a dominant role played by good luck in fostering the more stable macroeconomic environment of the last two decades. First, the Great Inflation was due, to a dominant extent, to large demand non-policy shocks, and to a lower extent to supply shocks. Second, imposing either Volcker or Greenspan over the entire sample period would only have had a limited impact on the Great Inflation episode, while imposing Burns and Miller would have resulted in a counterfactual inflation path remarkably close to the actual historical one. Although the systematic component of monetary policy clearly appears to have improved over the sample period, this does not appear to have been the dominant influence in post-WWII U.S. macroeconomic dynamics.

TI  - Demand for Money Function in Case of Philippines: An Empirical Analysis
AU  - Kerdpitak, Asistant Prof.Dr.Chayanan
T2  - Research in World Economy
AB  - An effective formulation of monetary policy provides an empirical and coherent model of money related with demand. In order for the monetary authorities to understand the demand for the purpose of money function, the steadiness of money demand is important as it leads towards an application of efficient monetary policy. In order to examine the stability of money demand function of Philippines, following study was conducted with broad money, real asset price index, GDP deflator, real GDP, long-term interest rate and short-term interest rate. For empirical investigation, unit root test, cointegration, and Granger-Causality tests were used. However, the findings of the cointegration suggests that cointegration reveals there is presence of linear combinations, and results shows that there are four cointegrating equations present. Therefore, it is evident that there are at least 4 cointegrating relations between the variables. Hence, some of macroeconomic indicators can be used to predict the broad money due to presence of vector. However, the Granger-Causality shows that no macroeconomic variable granger cause broad money (M1). Therefore, the selected macroeconomic indictors RS, LS, CPI, GDP deflator, RGDP and AP/P cannot be used to predict the variation in the broad money (M1) in case of Philippines. This means the money demand function in Philippines is not stable, and for this purpose further investigation is suggested by increasing sample size and time window in quarterly or semi-annually.

AB  - The empirical literature on the transmission of international shocks is based on small-scale VARs. In this paper, we use a large panel of data for 17 industrialized countries to investigate the international transmission mechanism, and revisit the anomalies that arise in the empirical literature. We propose a factor augmented VAR (FAVAR) that extends the model in Bernanke, Boivin, and Eliasz (2005) to the open economy. The main results can be summarized as follows. First, the dynamic effects on the UK economy of an unanticipated fall of short-term interest rates in the rest of the world are: real house price inflation, investment, GDP and consumption growth peak after 1 year, wages peak after 2 years, and CPI and GDP deflator inflation peak during the third year. Second, a positive international supply shock makes the distribution of the components of the UK consumption deflator negatively skewed. Third, in response to a domestic monetary shock, we find little evidence of the exchange rate and liquidity puzzles and little evidence of the forward discount and price anomalies.

TI  - Evaluating the Current Stance of Monetary Policy Using a Taylor Rule
AU  - Labonte, Marc
AB  - Oversight of the Federal Reserve’s (Fed’s) monetary policy decisions rests with Congress. But oversight is encumbered by the absence of a straightforward relationship between interest rates and economic performance. Further, the Fed’s policy decisions are discretionary, meaning there is no objective, transparent “yardstick” for evaluating their decisions. The Fed’s conventional policy tool is to target the federal funds rate, the overnight interest rate at which banks lend to each other. A simple rule of thumb guide to monetary policy decisions called a “Taylor rule” is an intuitive way to judge actual policy against some objective, albeit simplistic, ideal. Taylor rules prescribe a federal funds target based on inflation and the output gap (i.e., the difference between actual gross domestic product [GDP] and potential GDP) and can be adjusted to reflect a variety of policy goals.

T2  - Economic Bulletin Boxes
AB  - In this box, we present a new measure of domestic inflation for the euro area that takes into account the import intensity of HICP items. For this new indicator, the import intensities of HICP items are derived using information from national accounts and input-output tables. The HICP items with a relatively low import intensity are subsequently aggregated to a “Low IMport Intensity” (LIMI) inflation indicator. Differently to the literature, an empirical assessment is used to determine an optimal threshold for these import intensities. While the ECB’s inflation target is formulated in terms of headline inflation, the concept of domestic inflation is of analytical relevance to monetary policy, as it features prominently in the monetary policy transmission mechanism. Common indicators of domestic inflation, such as the GDP deflator or core inflation, either include elements that are not directly related to consumer prices or exclude volatile components that may nonetheless be driven by domestic factors. The LIMI inflation indicator can complement the information provided by these other indicators in an assessment of the underlying inflationary pressures. JEL Classification: E32, J11, J21

AB  - This paper discusses about capitalism that is often thought of as an economic system in which private actors own and control property in accord with their interests, and demand and supply freely set prices in markets in a way that can serve the best interests of society. The essential feature of capitalism is the motive to make a profit. In a capitalist economy, capital assets—such as factories, mines, and railroads—can be privately owned and controlled, labor is purchased for money wages, capital gains accrue to private owners, and prices allocate capital and labor between competing uses. Although some form of capitalism is the basis for nearly all economies today, for much of the past century it was but one of two major approaches to economic organization. In the other, socialism, the state owns the means of production, and state-owned enterprises seek to maximize social good rather than profits.

AB  - The traditional interest rate policy has lost its potency due to the zero-lower bound of nominal interest rates and the gradual accelerating deflation in Japan. Without stopping deflation, the Japanese government may face a rapid erosion of credit worthiness due to an uncontrolled budget deficit. In order to cope with this unusual situation, a non-traditional monetary policy measure is proposed. A negative nominal interest rate is needed to clear Japanese markets and can be achieved by levying a tax on all the government-guaranteed yen financial assets. This is a modified version of Gesell's stamp duty on currency for actual implementation in the contemporary context. The benefits and side effects of this tax for Japan are analyzed here.

By constructing a large panel of banks across Western Europe, we provide evidence that differences in bank ownership influence the transmission of monetary policy via the risk-taking channel. While shareholder banks actively adjust the riskiness of their portfolios to changes in interest rates, stakeholder banks appear to be less responsive to such changes. These findings call for greater attention to the nature of bank ownership when setting monetary policy.

TI  - Exact Prediction of Inflation and Unemployment in Germany
AU  - Kitov, Ivan
AB  - Potential links between inflation, (t), and unemployment, UE(t), in Germany have been examined. There exists a consistent (conventional) Phillips curve despite some changes in monetary policy. This Phillips curve is characterized by a negative relation between inflation and unemployment with the latter leading the former by one year: UE(t-1) = 1.50(t) + 0.116. Effectively, growing unemployment has resulted in decreasing inflation since 1971, i.e. for the period where GDP deflator observations are available. The relation between inflation and unemployment is statistically reliable with R2=0.86, where unemployment spans the range from 0.01 to 0.12 and inflation, as represented by GDP deflator, varies from -0.01 to 0.07.

AB  - This paper investigates the usefulness of the money demand relationship in times of unconventional monetary policies by cointegration methods. Our empirical evidence shows the existence of stable long run money demand functions even in the period of interest rates near the zero bound, both for the US economy and the euro area. Evidence is based on standard monetary aggregates, i.e. MZM for the US and M3 for the euro area. The recent monetary policy shifts towards unconventional measures do not lead to a breakdown of money demand. The relationships do not show instabilities and are robust against the Lucas critique.

T2  - Journal of Banking & Finance
AB  - This paper analyses the impact of monetary shocks on bank lending in Germany. We follow a cross-sectoral approach by looking at six different banking groups. In general, smaller banks hold a larger buffer of liquid assets which they can use to offset monetary shocks. In addition, the response of bank lending after a monetary contraction is very different across banking sectors. Lending by the credit co-operatives, which are on average the smallest banks, declines most, whereas big banks are able to shield their loans portfolio against monetary shocks. Overall, our results provide support for the existence of a bank lending channel.

TI  - The Impact of Monetary Policy on the Cross-Sectional Variance of Expectations of Inﬂation
AU  - Fulford, Scott Lansing
AB  - Forecasters tend to disagree about the rate of inﬂation in the future. The level of disagreement, as measured by the variance of the forecasts, changes over time. By focusing on heterogeneity of beliefs, this paper studies how monetary policy impacts this cross-sectional variance. The Federal Reserve, by changing the structural environment in which forecasters work, may spark disagreement among forecasters as to the correct model and weight to put on information. The marginal effects of different aspects of Federal Reserve policy are studied by creating an index related to all of the information available to forecasters except Federal Reserve policy. Changes in the Federal Funds target rate have an asymmetric effect, with increases raising the cross-sectional variance and decreases lowering it. Viewed as part of a larger policy, any change in a long-standing Federal Reserve policy increases the cross-sectional variance. Federal Reserve policy, when taken as a whole, has a signiﬁcant and important impact on the cross-sectional variance of forecasters, although this impact is part of a wider volatility.

The identified determinants of domestic inflation such as crude oil prices, output gap, fiscal policy and monetary policy, and their relation with inflation is studied in a structural vector auto regression (SVAR) model. Further, the temporal changes in inflation dynamics are analyzed using a time varying parameter SVAR model with stochastic volatility. It was found that inflation dynamics in India have changed over time with various determinants showing significant time variation in the recent years, particularly after the global financial crisis.

TI  - Multiple Structural Breaks and Inflation Persistence in Belarus
AU  - Pelipas, Igor
AB  - This paper address the issue of assessing inflation persistence in Belarus using quarterly seasonally adjusted data over 1996–2011. To detect multiple structural breaks during the analyzed period, we applied recently developed and practically implemented in OxMetrics software impulse indicator saturation technique. Impulse indicator saturation break test allowed us to detect three structural breaks in dynamics of GDP deflator inflation and CPI inflation, including one at the end of the examined sample. All detected break dates have a clear-cut economic interpretation. Taking these structural brakes into account, while testing for dynamics properties of inflation and its persistence, we found that GDP deflator inflation and CPI inflation in Belarus are stationary variables with the changing means. Formal unit root testing with multiple structural breaks demonstrated that non-stationarity is rejected at one per cent significance level. The point estimates if inflation persistence for GDP deflator and CPI inflation are quite small (0.32 and 0.53 respectively). GDP deflator inflation and CPI inflation return to its equilibrium level after a shock in about 1.5 and 2 quarter correspondently. Thus, one can consider inflation persistence in Belarus over the sample period as a quite moderate. These results have the explicit policy implications. Low inflation persistence in Belarus is a sound prerequisite for macroeconomic stabilization and anti-inflation monetary policy. Additionally, the stationarity of inflation can be considered as an important element of the technical possibilities of implementing inflation targeting in Belarus.

TI  - Monetary Policy, Data Uncertainty and the Supply Side: Living with the Statistical Fog
AU  - Bell, Marian
AB  - Economic statistics are often only an approximation of the underlying reality they are attempting to measure. Official statistics, especially in timely first releases, can be subject to significant uncertainty and revision. In this speech, Marian Bell, a member of the Monetary Policy Committee, looks at the various ways in which data uncertainty might arise and discusses how policymakers should respond. A particular difficulty for statisticians can be the allocation of movements in nominal variables to changes in prices and volumes. Such uncertainty is high when the structure of the economy and relative prices change significantly. In such circumstances, looking at a money value measure of activity may be informative.

TI  - The Risks of Deﬂation and the Eﬀectiveness of Monetary Policy in the Euro Area
AU  - Svensson, Lars E O
AB  - There is little risk of deﬂation and a liquidity trap in the euro area. Inﬂation and shortand long-term inﬂation expectations are relatively close to 2% per year. With the current short nominal interest rate at 2%, there is ample room for more expansionary monetary policy if needed, and there is no reason to doubt the eﬀectiveness of standard monetary policy in the euro area. Although temporary deﬂation in Germany cannot be excluded, there is no risk for prolonged deﬂation in Germany, since with a common currency German competitiveness would improve and stimulate exporting and import-competing sectors in Germany. In the very unlikely event of a liquidity trap in the euro area, in which case the eﬀectiveness of standard monetary policy would be considerably weakened, my proposed Foolproof Way —with (1) a price-level target path, (2) a currency depreciation and a temporary crawling peg, and (3) an exit strategy in the form of a return to a ﬂoat and normal monetary policy when the price-level target has been reached — can be used as an eﬀective means to escape from the liquidity trap.

TI  - Monetary Policy in Japan’s ‘Great Recession:’
AU  - Kirchner, Stephen
AB  - This paper estimates a reduced-form model of the Japanese economy that incorporates a role for money in the determination of GDP growth and inflation. Real base money growth is shown to be a significant determinant of GDP growth, suggesting a role for money even under a monetary policy operating regime in which base money is endogenous to the determination of an official interest rate. An aggregate supply curve is estimated, in which a velocity gap derived from a p-star model of the equilibrium price level is included as an explanatory variable. The estimated supply function suggests a role for both financial and goods market equilibrium in the determination of inflation outcomes, however, the relationship between the velocity gap and inflation breaks-down in the 1990s. The properties of a modified McCallum (1988) base money growth-nominal GDP targeting policy rule are also examined. The paper considers whether a McCallum-type policy rule provides a basis for overcoming the non-linearities and global instability problems implied by Taylor-type interest rate rules in the presence of the zero bound on nominal interest rates and low inflation.

TI  - Monetary policy in disarray
AU  - Tatom, John
AB  - Monetary policy has become difficult to characterize or follow since 2007.  A debate as to whether interest rate targets or monetary aggregate targets are better indicators of policy and prospective outcomes has given way to a new credit policy built on inflating the Federal Reserve (Fed) balance sheet to provide private sector credit.  This policy grew out of the Great Depression and has led the Fed to ignore monetary growth and render a federal funds rate target impotent by pushing it to zero. To implement the more than doubling of the Fed’s assets, the Fed took up commercial banking policies. Three examples are: selling Treasury assets to fund private assets, paying subsidies to banks for holding reserves and attracting a new class of Treasury debt sterilized in Fed deposits. These actions insulated monetary aggregates and the effective monetary base from the explosion in the Fed’s balance sheet. The new credit policy severed the tight link that had existed for over 70 years between Fed credit and its effective monetary base.  Fortunately, it also insulated the economy from a more than doubling of the general price level.  But these actions have turned the balance sheet of the Fed into a collection of illiquid and risky private assets.  A similar portfolio of government securities that has the longest duration in history and therefore the greatest interest rate risk limits the Fed’s ability to reduce its assets or the excess reserve position of banks, exceeding $1.5 trillion and costing the taxpayer over $3.3 billion, from 2009 to mid-2011.  The subsidy and excess reserve levels of the first half of 2011 will cost $2.3 billion per year going forward.   Finally, the paper rebuts claims by Fed officials that the Fed has successfully followed the framework of monetary policy developed by Milton Friedman.  The paper concludes with recommendations for Congressional restrictions on the Fed and Treasury to ensure that the Fed focus on responsible monetary policy and not its failed credit policy.

TI  - PENGARUH KEBIJAKAN MONETER TERHADAP KETIMPANGAN DISTRIBUSI PENDAPATAN DI 33 PROVINSI DI INDONESIA (2010-2019
AU  - Wibowo, Ari
AB  - Ketimpangan distribusi pendapatan adalah salah satu indikator penting untuk menilai kinerja perekonomian di suatu negara. Pasalnya dengan ini pembuat kebijakan bisa melihat apakah pertumbuhan ekonomi dirasakan oleh seluruh masyarakat atau hanya sebagian orang saja. Selain untuk merumuskan suatu kebijakan yang tepat, memahami permasalahan dasar mengenai kesenjangan pendapatan juga penting untuk pengambil langkah kebijakan bank sentral. Tujuan penelitian ini yaitu melihat pengaruh kebijakan moneter terhadap kesenjangan distribusi pendapatan di Indonesia selama kurun waktu 2010 hingga  2019. Alat analisis yang digunakan adalah System Generalized Method of Moments (System GMM) yang berbasis	dari	data   panel. Variable of interest pada penelitian ini adalah real interest rate sebagai proksi kebijakan suku bunga moneter Bank  Indonesia, sedangkan sebagai dependent variable adalah Gini ratio, serta control variable adalah GDP deflator, pendapatan per kapita riil, dan posisi kredit riil. Hasil temuan empiris dalam penelitian ini menunjukkan bahwa kebijakan moneter yang diproksikan melalui instrumen BI rate secara signifikan tidak memengaruhi ketimpangan distribusi pendapatan di Indonesia. Hal ini dimungkinkan karena adanya variabel transmisi lain yang berpengaruh terhadap Gini ratio. Adapun faktor yang memengaruhi ketimpangan pendapatan secara signifikan  adalah variabel lag ketimpangan pendapatan, pendapatan per kapita riil, dan juga posisi kredit riil per provinsi.

Inequality of income distribution is one of the important indicators to assess economic performance in a country. Because with this policy makers can see whether economic growth is felt by the whole community or only some people. In addition to formulating an appropriate policy, understanding the basic issues regarding income inequality is also important for central bank policy makers. The purpose of this study is to look at the effect of monetary policy on the income distribution gap in Indonesia during the period 2010 to 2019. The analytical tool used is the Generalized Method of Moments (System GMM) based on panel data. Variable of	interest in this study is the real interest rate as a proxy for Bank Indonesia's monetary interest rate policy, while the dependent variable is the Gini ratio, and control variable is the GDP deflator, real per capita income, and real outstanding credit. The empirical findings in this study indicate that monetary policy as proxied through the BI rate instrument does not significantly affect the inequality of income distribution in Indonesia. This is possible because there are other transmission variables that affect the Gini ratio. The factors that significantly influence income inequality are lag, real per capita income, and also the real credit position per province.

T2  - Economic Inquiry
AB  - This paper evaluates the role of inflation-forecast heterogeneity in U.S. monetary policymaking. The deviation between private and central bank inflation forecasts is identified as a significant explanatory factor behind the Fed's monetary policy decisions. A discretionary policy rule that includes the forecast deviation as an additional argument is estimated empirically for the period 1975–2009, covering the chairmanships of Arthur Burns, George Miller, Paul Volcker, Alan Greenspan, and the beginning of Ben Bernanke's term, by using inflation forecasts obtained from the Federal Open Market Committee's Greenbook and the Survey of Professional Forecasters and real-time estimates of the output gap. The estimated rule appears to provide a consistent description of the Fed's policy during the sample period presenting an alternative perspective regarding the key drivers of the high-inflation phase in the 1970s as well as of the successful Volcker disinflation in the early 1980s and the gradual transition to a regime of lower inflation and high policy credibility that has increasingly characterized monetary policy over the past two decades.

AB  - Monetary policymakers and central banks universally recognize that, in the long run, inflation is strictly determined by monetary policy. However, they disagree sharply about the role of monetary aggregates in the conduct of monetary policy. ; These differences in views are reflected in the way the Federal Reserve and the ECB conduct monetary policy and communicate with the public. At the Federal Reserve, the Federal Open Market Committee no longer specifies targets or monitoring ranges for the monetary aggregates, and committee members seldom mention the aggregates in their deliberations. In contrast, the ECB regularly examines the implications of money growth for the inflation outlook over the medium term to long term. What accounts for these differences of views, and why do the Federal Reserve and ECB see things so differently? ; Kahn and Benolkin examine why the Federal Reserve and ECB differ in their approach to the monetary aggregates and find two main reasons. First, their institutional histories are different. And, second, in the United States and the Euro area, there are differences in the usefulness of monetary aggregates as indicators of future economic conditions over the medium to long run.

AU  - Khan, Mohammed Abdul Imran
AB  - The RBI in its mid-quarterly review, however, hinted at rate cuts in future. It had increased rates 13 times since March, 2010, to tame inflation. The central bank today kept its key policy rates unchanged. From this point on, monetary policy actions are likely to reverse the cycle, responding to the risks to growth.Which inflation index do we target? We look at detailed price data, expenditure patterns of house­holds and the composition of different price indices available in India. Though monetary policy in India is not explicitly charged with delivering low and stable inflation, it still needs to choose a measure of inflation as a reference. Questions of timeliness, weights in the price index, accuracy of food price measurement, and inclusion of the prices of services are relevant to the choice of measure.

AB  - The inflation is known as a general -- or generalized - increase of prices of goods and services for a long period, leading to the decrease of money value and subsequently purchasing power. The galloping evolution of prices is undoubtedly one of the marking phenomenon of Romanian economy after 1990. It is to be outlined that the amplitude of price variations does not limit only at the level, but, more, at modifications in the structure of prices in economy, to resettle the price system in compliance with the market and to eliminate the disequilibrium induced by the unrealistic price reports inherited from the centralized economy. The GDP deflator is a comprehensive price index, including both the influences induced by goods and services for consumption, capital goods, goods and services acquired by the public administration, and the goods and services traded in the international commerce, fact that recommends it for use in the annual and multi-annual economic analyses and forecasts.

AB  - Federal Reserve officials and many observers of monetary policy claim that the implementation of monetary policy has become more “transparent” over the last decade. This paper argues that monetary policy is anything but transparent because multiple and conflicting goals for monetary policy still exist, precise targets for these goals never are defined, the Fed’s economic model is unknown to the public and, by confusing its apparent intermediate target variable with its true policy instrument, actions taken to be stimulative can be contractionary and vice versa.

TI  - Dilemma not Trilemma: The Global Financial Cycle and Monetary Policy Independence
AU  - Rey, Hélène
AB  - There is a global financial cycle in capital flows, asset prices and in credit growth. This cycle co‐moves with the VIX, a measure of uncertainty and risk aversion of the markets. Asset markets in countries with more credit inflows are more sensitive to the global cycle. The global financial cycle is not aligned with countries’ specific macroeconomic conditions. Symptoms can go from benign to large asset price bubbles and excess credit creation, which are among the best predictors of financial crises. A VAR analysis suggests that one of the determinants of the global financial cycle is monetary policy in the centre country, which affects leverage of global banks, capital flows and credit growth in the international financial system. Whenever capital is freely mobile, the global financial cycle constrains national monetary policies regardless of the exchange rate regime. For the past few decades, international macroeconomics has postulated the “trilemma”: with free capital mobility, independent monetary policies are feasible if and only if exchange rates are floating. The global financial cycle transforms the trilemma into a “dilemma” or an “irreconcilable duo”: independent monetary policies are possible if and only if the capital account is managed. So should policy restrict capital mobility? Gains to international capital flows have proved elusive whether in calibrated models or in the data. Large gross flows disrupt asset markets and financial intermediation, so the costs may be very large. To deal with the global financial cycle and the “dilemma”, we have the following policy options: ( a) targeted capital controls; (b) acting on one of the sources of the financial cycle itself, the monetary policy of the Fed and other main central banks; (c) acting on the transmission channel cyclically by limiting credit growth and leverage during the upturn of the cycle, using national macroprudential policies; (d) acting on the transmission channel structurally by imposing stricter limits on leverage for all financial intermediaries.

AU  - Justiniano, Alejandro
AB  - Monetary authorities often express their views about the economic outlook for the economy, the important factors inﬂuencing that outlook, and the possible consequences for monetary policy. This kind of monetary policy communication has come to be known as forward guidance. Evidence suggests that forward guidance has inﬂuenced asset prices. This paper investigates whether forward guidance has inﬂuenced the real economy. We have two main contributions. First we extend the traditional interest rate rule used to summarize monetary policy in these models to include forward guidance. Second, we estimate a New Keynesian model with this rule and use it to quantify the historical eﬀects of monetary policy forward guidance. On the latter we ﬁnd that more than half the business cycle variation in the federal funds rate before the ﬁnancial crisis is accounted for by forward guidance. This suggests that traditional interest rate rules are miss-speciﬁed. Forward guidance explains about 9% of output ﬂuctuations at business cycle frequencies, but much more in certain episodes.

AB  - Since the publication (1976) of the classic Lucas critique, researchers in empirical macroeconomics have endeavored to specify models that capture the underlying dynamic decision-making behavior of consumers and firms who require forecasts of future events. Recently, a number of researchers have developed simple models that have become the workhorses for monetary policy analysis. The models vary considerably with regard to optimizing foundations and explicit treatment of expectations. However, relatively little effort has been devoted to testing the empirical importance of the Lucas critique for these simple models. Can one find specifications that are policy-invariant? This paper develops and implements a set of tests for several monetary policy models used extensively in the literature. In particular, we attempt to test the robustness of optimizing versus nonoptimizing models to changes in the monetary policy regime. We present evidence that shows that some forward-looking
models from the recent literature may be less stable than their better-fitting backward-looking counterparts.

T2  - Journal of Macroeconomics
T3  - Monetary Rules for a Post-Crisis World
AB  - Discussions of monetary policy rules after the 2007–2009 recession highlight the potential ineffectiveness of a central bank's actions when the short-term interest rate under its control is limited by the zero lower bound. This perspective assumes, in a manner consistent with the canonical New Keynesian model, that the quantity of money has no role to play in transmitting a central bank's actions to economic activity. This paper examines the validity of this claim and investigates the properties of alternative monetary policy rules based on control of the monetary base or a monetary aggregate in lieu of the capacity to manipulate a short-term interest rate. The results indicate that rules of this type have the potential to guide monetary policy decisions toward the achievement of a long-run nominal goal without being constrained by the zero lower bound on a nominal interest rate. They suggest, in particular, that by exerting its influence over the monetary base or a broader aggregate, the Federal Reserve could more effectively stabilize nominal income around a long-run target path, even in a low or zero interest-rate environment.

T2  - China Economic Review
AB  - Motivated by the institutional features of China's monetary policy, this paper aims at identifying the most data favored monetary policy rule for China within a dynamic stochastic general equilibrium (DSGE) model framework. In a canonical New-Keynesian DSGE model, we carry out a positive analysis by employing Bayesian methods to estimate three main categories of monetary policy rules, namely a Taylor-type interest rate rule, a money growth rule and an expanded Taylor rule with money. Based on China's quarterly data from 1996Q2 to 2015Q4, our estimation shows that the expanded Taylor rule obtains the best empirical fit to the data. Moreover, impulse responses and forecast error variance decompositions demonstrate that monetary policy rules with or without money provide very different implications for the policy behavior. Our results ultimately suggest that money has so far been more closely targeted than nominal interest rate and still plays an important role as a monetary policy target in China. Furthermore, a conventional Taylor-type interest rate rule is not good enough yet to describe China's monetary policy behavior.

AU  - English, William B.

T2  - Contributions in Macroeconomics
AB  - Many researchers have found that the lagged interest rate enters estimated monetary policy rules with overwhelming significance, suggesting that policy adjusts gradually to changes in economic conditions. However, Rudebusch (2002) argues that the lagged interest rate is not a fundamental component of the U.S. policy rule, and that its significance arises from the omission of serially correlated variables from the policy rule. This paper considers the possibility that policy rules may be characterized by both partial adjustment and serially correlated omitted variables. Our findings indicate that even if one allows for serially correlated errors, partial adjustment plays an important role in describing the behavior of the federal funds rate.

AB  - There is an ongoing debate on how to identify monetary policy shocks in SVAR models. Graphical modelling exploits statistical properties of data for identification and offers a data based tool to shed light on the issue. We conduct a cross-country analysis, considering European Monetary Union (EMU), Japan and US. We obtain some important results. The information set of the monetary authorities, which is essential for the identification of the monetary shock seems to depend on availability of data in terms of higher frequency with respect to the policy instrument (US and Japan). Moreover, there is not yet a widespread consensus on whether or not the European Monetary Union should be considered as a closed economy. Our results indicate that EMU official interest rate depends on the US federal funds rate.

TI  - The Portfolio Balance Channel of Monetary Policy: Evidence from the U.S. Financial Accounts
AU  - Beckworth, David

T2  - SSRN Electronic Journal
AB  - How does monetary policy affect the balance sheet of households? This is an important question in light of the recent large scale asset purchases that have been justified on the grounds of the portfolio balance channel. Many studies have attempted to quantify the effect of these LSAPs and find evidence for the portfolio channel. Most of these studies, however, focus only on one manifestation of the portfolio channel, the change in relative yields and typically do so in the narrow context of the zero lower bound. Little is empirically known about this channel in more conventional settings. This paper attempts to fill this gap in the literature by examining the overall validity of the channel away from the zero lower bound. We do this by examining how household portfolios responded to monetary policy shocks to the monetary base and to inflation forecasts for the period 1959:Q1 – 2007:Q4. We find strong evidence that the portfolio channel is an important part of the monetary transmission mechanism.

Other possibilities include a higher inflation target and temporary exchange rate targeting.

AB  - Though monetary policy in India is not explicitly charged with delivering low and stable inflation, it still needs to choose a measure of inflation as a reference. Questions of timeliness, weights in the price index, accuracy of food price measurement, and inclusion of the prices of services are relevant to the choice of measure. This paper looks at detailed price data, expenditure patterns of households and the composition of different price indices available in India, and discusses policies on inflation measurement in other countries. Under present conditions of measurement, the consumer price index for industrial workers, despite some serious deficiencies, is preferable to both the wholesale price index and the GDP deflator as the headline inflation rate. Thus, macroeconomic analysis and policy thinking need to move away from a focus on the WPI to the CPI-IW.

TI  - Measuring the Effects of Monetary Policy:A DSGE-DFM Approach
AU  - Iiboshi, Hirokuni
AB  - I propose new method of measuring the effect of monetary policy on a large number of macroeconomic series by combining dynamic stochastic general equilibrium (DSGE) with a dynamic factor model (DFM) in a data-rich environment including a broad range of useful information for both central banks and the private sector. This method can resolve two problems inherent in the FAVAR approach proposed by Bernanke, Boivin and Eliasz (2005), yet can enjoy its beneﬁts as well. Other positive aspects of this method are to split off components of model concepts (or common factors) and measurement errors from all observable variables, and to identify structural shocks, including monetary policy shocks, from the point of view of DSGE based on a microeconomic foundation with rational expectations. This new method calculates historical decomposition, which provides useful information for policy analysis for researchers and policymakers, as well as theoretically reasonable impulse response functions and variance decompositions for all observable variables of large panel data. Through this method I will provide empirical illustrations of 55 Japanese macroeconomic series during the late 1980s and the 1990s using a Smets-Wouter (2003, 2007) type medium size DSGE model.

This paper examines the effect of temporal aggregation of interest rates on forward-looking Taylor-type monetary policy rules. Results show that using quarterly-averaged interest rates in standard forward-looking structures adds a spurious bias to parameters that measure the extent of interest rate smoothing and serial correlation of shocks. Consequently, empirical interpretations of persistence in policy interest rate changes are distorted.

AB  - The impact of the monetary policy, especially the impact of the forward-looking Taylor rules on the equity risk premium from the perspective of investor’ risk perception was examined for the United States. This is done by using three forward-looking Taylor rules as well as the Fama-French five factors model. In addition, the impacts of federal funds rates before and after the financial crisis in 2008 are compared. This study adds to the literature by exploring the relationship between equity premium and the monetary policy with the usage of four variables from the Fama-French five factors model. The results show that a significant and negative relationship is observed between the monetary policy and excess return on equity. Moreover, the impact of federal funds rates is higher during the post-crisis period. Keywords: the Taylor rule, the equity premium, Fama-French five factors model

AU  - Bosnjak, Mile
AB  - This paper aims to evaluate validity of Bank-Lending Channel Revisited theory (BLCR) within a macroeconomic framework extended for diversified credit demand.  The extension of BLCR model (EBLCR) relaxed assumption of credit cycle as a function of bank lending rate and enabled a more comprehensive analysis of demand for credit. In order to include a diversified credit demand in the original BLCR model, we put an alternative financing source in addition to the bank lending; the commercial papers market. This extension seems to undermine the main conclusions provided by BLCR; banks financing cost is not the only relevant variable in driving credit cycle. Specifically, bank lending and commercial papers may become “close” substitutes following monetary policy and aggregate demand shock, reducing the relevance of bank lending in whole credit market. In order to develop this reasoning; we have looked at U.S economy during the period 1°Q 1980 - 1°Q 2020 through a time-varying non-parametric VAR model.

AB  - After almost two decades of implementing structural and macroeconomic adjustment programmes, some West African countries continue to experience declining trends in per capita domestic food production, rising food imports and volatile food prices. Real food prices increased up to 7 percent per year during the 1980–1998 period. A vector error correction model was used in investigating the impacts of monetary and macroeconomic factors on food prices during the 1960–1998 period. Food price shocks have significant impacts on domestic food production, and are a major source of macroeconomic instability in West Africa. Trade, exchange rate and monetary policy reforms have significant impacts on food prices and domestic agricultural production. These policies influence consumption patterns, and have serious implications for poverty reduction, food security issues and agricultural growth in Africa.

TI  - Inflation Persistence: Facts or Artefacts?
AU  - Robalo Marques, Carlos
AB  - This paper addresses some issues concerning the definition and measurement of inflation persistence in the context of the univariate approach. First, it is stressed that any estimate of persistence should be seen as conditional on the given assumption for the long run level of inflation and that such long run level should be allowed to vary through time. Second, a non-parametric measure of persistence is suggested which explores the relation between persistence and mean reversion. Third, inflation persistence in the U.S. and the Euro Area is re-evaluated allowing for a time varying mean and it is found that estimates of persistence crucially depend on the function used to proxy the mean of inflation. In particular, the widespread belief that inflation has been more persistent in the sixties and seventies than in the last twenty years is shown to obtain only for the U.S. and for the special case of a constant mean.
