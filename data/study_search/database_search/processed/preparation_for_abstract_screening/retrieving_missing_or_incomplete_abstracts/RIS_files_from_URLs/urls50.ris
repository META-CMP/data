AB  - What is the impact of monetary policy on the Malaysian consumer? The study addresses this issue by empirically investigating the consequences of interest rate shocks on consumer credit in Malaysia. The study relies on the impulse response functions and the variance decomposition analysis based on the structural Vector Auto-regression methodology. Apart from analysing the responses of aggregate consumer loans (ACL) to interest rate changes, further disaggregation is made in efforts to arrive at more detailed findings. In particular, the ACL data are categorized into loans for purchase of residential property, loans for personal uses, loans for credit cards, loans for purchase of consumer durables, loans for purchase of passenger cars and loans for purchase of securities. Through this disaggregation, the study shows the relative sensitivity of the various types of consumer loans to interest rate shocks.

AB  - After the financial crisis, financial stability and sustainability became key to global economic and social development, and the coordination of monetary policy and macroprudential policy plays a crucial role in maintaining financial stability and sustainability. This paper provides a theoretical analysis and empirical evidence from China on the impact of monetary policy and macroprudential policy coordination on financial stability and sustainability. We collect data from 2003 to 2017; from the micro level, we use the System Generalized Method of Moments (System GMM) method to analyze the monetary policy and macroprudential policy coordination effect on 88 commercial banks’ risk-taking; from the macro level, we use the Structural Vector Autoregression (SVAR) method to analyze the two policies coordination effect on housing prices and stock price bubbles. The conclusions are as follows: firstly, for regulating bank risk-taking, monetary policy and macroprudential policy should conduct counter-cyclical regulation simultaneously; secondly, for regulating housing prices, tight monetary policy and tight macroprudential policy should be implemented alternately; thirdly, for regulating stock price bubbles, macroprudential policy should be the first line of defense and monetary policy should be the second one.

AB  - This paper provides a how-to guide to model-based forecasting and monetary policy analysis. It describes a simple structural model, along the lines of those in use in a number of central banks. This workhorse model consists of an aggregate demand (or IS) curve, a price-setting (or Phillips) curve, a version of the uncovered interest parity condition, and a monetary policy reaction function. The paper discusses how to parameterize the model and use it for forecasting and policy analysis, illustrating with an application to Canada. It also introduces a set of useful software tools for conducting a model-consistent forecast.

T2  - Journal of Monetary Economics
AB  - Using a tractable OLG model with government debt, we study a redistribution channel for the transmission of monetary policy. Expansionary open-market operations generate a negative wealth effect, increasing households’ incentives to save and pushing down the real interest rate. This leads to a substitution towards durables, generating a temporary boom in the durable-good sector. With search and matching frictions, the fall in interest rates causes an increase in labor demand, raising aggregate employment. The model mimics the empirical responses of key macroeconomic variables to monetary policy interventions. The fiscal policy stance plays a key role in the transmission mechanism.

AU  - Kim, Soyoung
T2  - Journal of Monetary Economics
AB  - This paper documents data-oriented, detailed evidence on the international transmission of U.S. monetary policy shocks for the flexible exchange rate period using VAR models. First, U.S. expansionary monetary policy shocks lead to booms in the non-U.S., G-6 countries. In this transmission, changes in trade balance seem to play a minor role while a decrease in the world real interest rate seems important. Second, U.S. expansionary monetary policy shocks worsen the U.S. trade balance in about a year, but subsequently it improves. Overall, the basic versions of Mundell–Flemming–Dornbusch (MFD) and the sticky price (or sticky wage) intertemporal models do not seem to be consistent with the details of the transmission mechanism, and some extended versions seem to be necessary to fit the details.

AB  - This study investigates the multidimensional aspects of information in State Bank of Pakistan monetary policy; which consists of the policy rate and the monetary policy statements released by the Monetary Policy Committee. The effects of monetary policy communication and its tone on market expectations and the subsequent effects on macroeconomic variables i.e. the Consumer Price Index, output and credit intake is investigated. The Johansen's co-integration test showed existence of one co-integration equation; after which Vector Error Correction Model (VECM) was estimated to establish the long and short run relationships between variables. The language of monetary policy communication Granger causes CPI and credit intake in the short run. It was found that policy rate does not Granger cause any of the variables used. Nonetheless, neither the language of communication nor the policy rate have particularly strong effects on macroeconomic variables.

TI  - Japan's Deflation and the Bank of Japan's Experience with Nontraditional Monetary Policy
AU  - Ueda, Kazuo
T2  - Journal of Money, Credit and Banking
AB  - This paper offers a brief summary of nontraditional monetary policy measures adopted by the Bank of Japan (BOJ) during the last two decades, especially the period 1998–2006, when the so-called zero interest rate policy (ZIRP) and quantitative easing (QE) were put in place. The paper begins with a typology of policies usable at low interest and inflation rates. They are: strategy (i), management of expectations about future policy rates; strategy (ii), targeted asset purchases; and strategy (iii), QE. Alternatively, QE may be decomposed into a pure attempt to inflate the central bank balance sheet, QE0, purchases of assets in dysfunctional markets, QE1, and purchases of assets to generate portfolio rebalancing, QE2. Strategy (ii), when nonsterilized, is either QE1 or QE2. Using this typology, I review the measures adopted by the BOJ and discuss evidence on the effectiveness of the measures. The broad conclusion is that strategies (i) and (ii) have affected interest rates, while no clear evidence exists so far of the effectiveness of the pure form of strategy (iii), or QE0. Strategy (ii) has been effective especially in containing risk/liquidity premiums in dysfunctional money markets; that is, QE1 has been effective. The effectiveness of QE2, however, is less clear-cut. The strategies, however, have failed to bring the Japanese economy out of the deflation trap so far. I discuss some possible reasons for this and also implications for the current U.S. situation.

AB  - This paper studies the role of monetary policy in a small open economy that experiences Dutch disease effects as a result of capital inflows, and examines the issue of whether such a policy should seek to address these effects from a welfare perspective. I find that Dutch disease effects occur under a fixed nominal exchange rate regime. However, a monetary policy regime characterized by generalized Taylor interest rate rules featuring either the real exchange rate or the nominal exchange rate avert Dutch disease effects. Welfare results reveal that the optimal rule is a generalized Taylor rule consistent with nominal exchange rate flexibility.

T2  - The Journal of Economic Asymmetries
AB  - Like many other emerging market economies, India is practising flexible inflation targeting through monetary policy. As the success of inflation targeting regime largely depends upon the ability of the central bank to predict the future path of inflation accurately, it is important to identify the predictors of inflation. The paper empirically examines the informational role of commodity futures prices for monetary policy in India considering the possible presence of asymmetries. Employing the Nonlinear Autoregressive Distributed Lag (NARDL) as estimation strategy, this study is probably the first attempt to examine the asymmetric relationship between commodity futures prices and macroeconomic variables relevant to monetary policymaking. The results are expected to assume significance for the policymakers as the presence of pass-through effects of commodity futures prices confirms its role as an information variable in the process of monetary policy making in India.

T2  - Economic Systems
AB  - This paper studies the wealth channel in China. Although the wealth channel has been found to be functioning in many advanced countries, its existence is yet to be explored in most emerging economies, also in China. In order to illuminate dynamics between monetary policy, asset prices and consumption, we use the structural vector autoregression method. The findings support the view that a loosening of China's monetary policy does indeed lead to higher asset prices. Furthermore, a positive shock to residential prices increases household consumption, while the role of stock prices seems to be small from the households’ point of view. Finally, we test the existence of the wealth channel more formally to find out whether those changes in asset prices that are caused by monetary policy are significant enough to increase consumption. In summary, the wealth channel remains weak but there are some signs of it via residential prices. The results are not that different from those attained for the advanced economies, where the size of the wealth channel has been found to be limited.

AB  - PPP is unlikely to hold instantaneously for all commodities across the different regions of a monetary area. It is therefore possible that monetary expansions or contractions will have different effects in different regions, if there are regional asymmetries in the monetary transmission mechanism. We estimate the size of such asymmetries across the nine provinces of South Africa over the period 1997-2005. There are large and statistically significant differences in the response of prices to monetary expansions and contractions.

AB  - We study the impact of US quantitative easing (QE) on both the emerging and advanced economies, estimating a global vector error-correction model (GVECM). We focus on the effects of reductions in the US term and corporate spreads. The estimated effects of QE are sizeable and vary across economies. First, we find the QE impact from reducing the US corporate spread to be more important than that from lowering the US term spread, consistent with Blinder's (2012) argument. Second, counterfactual exercises suggest that successive US QE measures might have prevented episodes of prolonged recession and deflation in the advanced economies. Third, the estimated effects on the emerging economies are diverse but generally larger than those found for the United States and other advanced economies. The estimates suggest that US monetary policy spillovers contributed to the overheating in Brazil, China and some other emerging economies in 2010 and 2011, but supported their respective recoveries in 2009 and 2012. These heterogeneous effects point to unevenly distributed benefits and costs of cross-border monetary policy spillovers.

T2  - Journal of Positive School Psychology
AB  - Inflation is one of the macroeconomic variables that practitioners usually focus on because it hurts the life of poor in particular and social welfare in general. It has been identified in the literatures that supply side bottlenecks, excessive aggregate demand and structural factors are the major source of inflation although the relative importance of each factor in explaining it varies from country to country. The objective of this study is to examine the effect of monetary policy variables on inflation proxed by consumer price index in Ethiopia. The result from Auto Regressive Distributive Lag indicates that expected inflation, real gross domestic product, money supply and real interest rate are the major determinants of inflation both in the long and the short run. Moreover, government expenditure, domestic credit and remittance inflow are also the main determinants of inflation in the short run. This study implies that government should design and follow policies that stabilize expectation of economic agents, ensure positive real interest rate, control money supply and promote domestic production. The movement of exchange rate, growth of money supply, government expenditure and remittance inflow should be in a way that it does not bring inflation. Furthermore, facilitating access to credit is also essential to promote real output and stabilize inflation. Finally, monetary authority that sets clear inflation target and committed to it is indispensible.

AB  - This paper addresses whether exchange rates respond to changes in expectations of future U.S. monetary policy when no actual monetary policy changes occur. We employ data on Federal funds futures contracts for extracting a measure of policy expectations, control for the surprise element of macroeconomic news and policy developments, and analyze more than 12 years of daily exchange rate data. Our findings show that continuous day-to-day changes in expectations of future monetary policy are associated in a highly significant and systematic way with day-to-day changes in exchange rates even when no actual monetary policy changes occur. This suggests that monetary policy matters for daily exchange rate determination in more ways than merely through infrequent, actual policy changes.

AU  - Jalali-Naini, Ahmad Reza

T2  - Middle East Development Journal
AB  - Motivated by recent experiences in Iran, this paper incorporates structural characteristics that reinforce the reluctance of central banks to commit to free floating exchange rates (‘fear of floating’) into optimal policy formulation to determine the extent of exchange rate involvement in monetary policy. We utilize a small stylized model of a small developing open economy calibrated for the Iranian economy to compare the performance of alternative policy regimes, namely flexible domestic inflation targeting, flexible consumer price index inflation targeting, and real exchange targeting in handling higher openness, higher exchange rate pass through, and financial vulnerability. Evaluation of the above alternative policy regimes and relative stability of key macroeconomic variables are conducted through an optimal Ramsey policy approach. The results suggest that, in financially vulnerable small open developing economies, consumer price IT may not be the optimal policy and giving a higher positive weight to the real exchange rate in the central bank’s loss function and allowing policy reaction to this variable via the instrument rate can result in a lower social loss and more stability for the key macroeconomic variables, and hence a superior policy regime. Policy evaluation results based both on stabilization and welfare measures obtained in this paper imply that for the developing commodity (oil) exporting economies with high degrees of financial vulnerability and relatively high pass-through rates, an IT policy framework in which the real exchange rate is also targeted is a superior regime.

In this study, reserves and loan loss provision are selected as a proxy to measure bank risk whereas return on assets is selected as a proxy for bank’s performance. The study also include the two bank specific control variables such as bank size and bank capitalization, and macroeconomic variables such as consumer price index and gross domestic product. This study used fixed effect and random effect panel data estimation techniques on dataset of top twenty Pakistanis banks from 2006 to 2020. This study confirms that bank risk taking positively linked with gross domestic product, consumer price index but nothing to do with interbank offer rate. However, the bank size have negative relationship with bank risk, and bank capital have no role in changing bank risk. Whereas, bank performance is positively linked with the interbank offer, gross domestic product and bank specific variables. The consumer price index don’t have any effect on bank performance. Study findings will be helpful for banks management to mitigate associated risks and enhance profitability in a more effective manner. However, for researchers it helps to understand critical areas dealing with banks risk taking appetite and performance.

T2  - Journal of International Money and Finance
AB  - We study optimal monetary policy for a small open economy in a model where both domestic prices and wages are sticky due to staggered contracts. The simultaneous presence of the two forms of nominal rigidities introduces an additional trade-off between domestic inflation and the output gap. We derive a second-order approximation to the average welfare losses that can be expressed in terms of the unconditional variances of the output gap, domestic price inflation, and wage inflation. As a consequence, the optimal policy seeks to minimize a weighted average of these variances. We analyze welfare implications of several alternative simple policy rules, and find that domestic price inflation targeting generates relatively large welfare losses, whereas CPI inflation targeting performs nearly as well as the optimal rule.

TI  - Optimal Discretionary Monetary Policy in the Open Economy: Choosing between CPI and Domestic Inflation as Target Variables
AU  - Guender, Alfred
AB  - In open economy, a choice can be made between two measures of inflation for use as a target variable: CPI inflation or domestic inflation. This paper considers flexible and strict inflation targeting strategies and explores the circumstances under which a domestic inflation target is preferred to a CPI inflation target. This is done from the perspectives of the central bank and society as a whole. The quantitative results of this paper indicate that under suitable conditions the temporal properties of stochastic disturbances are instrumental in determining which inflation target is preferred. The choice of target variable from society's viewpoint coincides almost perfectly with the choice of the central bank if the utility of the representative household serves as the welfare criterion for society. If qualitative aspects matter in the choice inflation target, then the role of temporal properties of the stochastic disturbances becomes less prominent. Policy conclusions are drawn with the help of a forward-looking model for a small open economy. This model has proper micro-foundations and exhibits two important features. First, the degree of openness affects the parameters of the IS relation and, second, under domestic inflation targeting, the existence of a direct exchange rate channel in the Phillips Curve impairs the perfect stabilising properties of monetary policy in the presence of demand-side disturbances.

TI  - Food Inflation in India: The Role for Monetary Policy
AU  - Anand, Rahul

AU  - Tulin, Mr Volodymyr
AB  - Indian food and fuel inflation has remained high for several years, and second-round effects on core inflation are estimated to be large. This paper estimates the size of second-round effects using an estimated reduced-form general equilibrium model of the Indian economy, which incorporates pass-through from headline inflation to core inflation. The results indicate that India's inflation is highly inertial and persistent. Due to second-round effects, the gap between headline inflation and core inflation decreases by about three fourths within one year as core inflation catches up with headline inflation. Large second-round effects stem from several factors, such as the high share of food in household expenditure and the role of food inflation in informing inflation expectations and wage setting. Analysis suggests that in order to durably reduce the current high inflation, the monetary policy stance needs to remain tight for a considerable length of time. In addition, progress on structural reforms to raise potential growth is critical to reduce the burden on monetary policy.

AB  - Using structural VAR models with short-run restrictions appropriate for Canada and the United States, we empirically examine whether trade and financial market openness matter for the impact on and transmission to stock prices of monetary policy shocks. We find that, in Canada, the immediate response of stock prices to a domestic contractionary monetary policy shock is small and the dynamic response is brief, whereas in the United States, the immediate response of stock prices to a similar shock is relatively large and the dynamic response is relatively prolonged. We find that these differences are largely driven by differences in financial market openness and hence different dynamic responses of monetary policy shocks between the two countries that we model in this paper.

AB  - This paper investigates how monetary policy shock affects the stock market of the United States (US) conditional on states of investor sentiment. In this regard, we use a recently developed estimator that uses high-frequency surprises as a proxy for the structural monetary policy shocks, which in turn is achieved by integrating the current short-term rate surprises, which are least affected by an information effect, into a vector autoregressive (VAR) model as an exogenous variable. When allowing for time-varying model parameters, we find that, compared to the low investor sentiment regime, the negative reaction of stock returns to contractionary monetary policy shocks is stronger in the state associated with relatively higher investor sentiment. Our results are robust to alternative sample period (which excludes the zero lower bound) and model specification and also have important implications for academicians, investors, and policymakers.

The topic of this session, “Monetary Policy in A Post-Crisis World,” is currently one of the most critical topics for central banks around the world. Following the global financial crisis triggered by the collapse of Lehman Brothers, the Federal Reserve (Fed) and the Bank of England (BOE) introduced unconventional monetary policy measures such as quantitative easingand forward guidance, which in turn has given rise to a growing body of theoretical research on these measures.

AB  - The research on the impact of monetary policy on Consumer price index (CPI) was conducted by taking Rwanda National Bank (BNR) as a case study, period 1985- 2010. The researcher main purpose was to evaluate the use of monetary policy on economy. The specific objectives were to find out the impact of monetary policy on CPI and to describe strategies of monetary policy in stabilizing Rwandan economy.To achieve the desired objectives, the researcher analyzed how independent variables of the Monetary Policy (Money Supplier, Exchange Rate and Lending Interest Rate) work and how they affect the dependent variable (CPI). Augmented DickeyFuller (ADF) and Phillips- Perron (PP) tests were used to for stationarity test. Engle- Granger two steps procedure and the Johansen Maximum Likelihood Methodology were used to see whether variables are cointegrated or not. The data analysis was done using Eviews 7 Software. Those tests revealed that there is no cointegration among variables. And this has leaded to the use of impulse response in order to estimate the impacts of monetary policy on Consumer price index.The research found that the National Bank of Rwanda uses different tools of monetary policy in order to stabilize economy. It uses them in attempting to achieve the objectives of the monetary policy. With those tools, money supply, credit, interest rates and other monetary variables can be manipulated by the central bank of Rwanda in order to stabilize economy.

AB  - The inability of monetary policies to efficiently and effectively exploit its policy objective could be a function of the pitfall of policy instruments adopted which seems to restrict its contributions to economic advancement in Nigeria. It is on this premise that this study investigated the efficacy of monetary policy instruments in Nigeria using monthly data from year 2000 to 2016. The study adopted the Johansen Multivariate Cointegration approach and Vector Error Correction (VECM). The Cointegration test established existence of long-term relationship between monetary policy instruments and economic growth. The study also revealed that there was monthly speed of adjustment of the variables towards their long-run equilibrium path to about 27 percent. The key discovery emanated from this study indicated that Consumer Price Index (CPI), Real Exchange Rate (RER), Money Supply (M2) and Interest Rate (INT) were significant monetary policy instruments that propelled economic growth in Nigeria during the period under review. Consequently, the study concluded by recommending Nominal GDP targeting as the framework to be adopted by the monetary authority in Nigeria in their monetary policy making process especially in the face of the new economic paradigm which is expected to be more plausible in improving and sustaining the stated Nigerian macro-economic objectives.

TI  - Monetary Policy Transmission on Real Trends in Serbia – VAR Analysis
AU  - Obradović, Jelena

T2  - Economic Themes
AB  - The efficiency of channels of monetary transmission varies from country to country and is conditioned by a number of factors that determine the economic and financial system of a country. In order to achieve the set monetary policy objectives, а central bank takes certain measures and employs instruments of monetary policy. Those instruments, however, act indirectly and with a certain lag. Due to these limitations in monetary policy effects, the analysis of the monetary transmission is of essence in every country as it enables its designers to determine an optimum monetary regime. In this paper, an analysis of monetary transmission in the Republic of Serbia is made using the Vector autoregressive model (VAR model). The research conducted is significant due to a current issue of the impact of monetary policy on actual economic trends, both in the developed and developing countries. On the basis of the research it is concluded that, in the time period under observation, the biggest impact on the fluctuations in industrial production in Serbia is that of monetary aggregate, whereas the biggest impact on the fluctuation in prices is that of key policy rate movements. The results of the analysis provide guidelines to monetary authorities to take necessary steps to shorten a lag period and eliminate restrictions in transmitting monetary impulses into real economic values.

AB  - This study is carried out in a small open economy New Keynesian DSGE model proposed by Monacelli (2005). As a result, firstly the exchange rate pass-through into import price and inflation is 0.69% and 0.49% respectively in short run. Secondly, the exchange rate acts as a shock absorber for domestic productivity and foreign demand shock. Thirdly, in case of incomplete pass-through the central bank of Mongolia is required to adjust the nominal interest rate more under the productivity shock. Therefore, considering incomplete pass-through is significant to improve the effectiveness of the monetary policy for the central bank of Mongolia.

AB  - Studies on Malaysia monetary policy mostly examine the effect of monetary policy change on output and inflation in aggregate terms. While sectoral output effects of monetary policy have also been investigated, there is however a lack in the study on the effect of policy change on disaggregated inflation. This paper attempts to examine the later issue by employing structural vector autoregressive (SVAR) model. By estimating the model separately for each sub sector of Malaysian consumer price index, we find that a modest monetary policy shock results in varying degree of responses in disaggregated inflation. In other words, some subsector inflation react rapidly while others respond sluggishly to a monetary policy shock. In contrast to aggregate inflation response, there is also evidence of price puzzle.

AB  - This paper uses a model calibrated to suit a small open Asian economy to present a series of counterfactual policy experiments aimed at comparing conventional optimal inflation targeting (IT) under commitment and discretion and variations of simple fixed monetary policy rules (MPRs). Two significant points of departure between the model presented here and previous ones for industrial countries are the incorporation of the real exchange rate and consideration of possible contractionary depreciation/devaluation. This represents a realistic scenario for some Asian economies after the crisis. In assessing the impact of different policy types it is essential to find parameters for model calibration that suitably represent the small and open Asian economies that have recently implemented inflation targeting arrangements. We have used estimates from Thailand over a recent period (1993-2003) to assist in selecting these parameters.

We use a structural vector autoregression (SVAR) model that incorporates the effect of a factor that reflects the global monetary policy stance. We use shocks in the US Fed monetary policy stance as a proxy of this global factor. Our results indicate mixed evidence depending on whether simultaneity between domestic monetary policy stance and the stock market behavior is taken into full account. When this simultaneity is not allowed we confirm previous evidence found in the literature, extended to the international field: a lax monetary policy, both domestic and global, decreases risk aversion. However, when we take this into account, results indicate that a lax monetary policy increase in the short-run the risk aversion of the domestic representative investor.

AB  - This paper uses a recursive VAR model to analyze the effects of monetary policy shock and the role of house price and stock price shocks. The data come from the first quarter of 1993 to the second quarter of 2010 in Taiwan. There is empirical evidence suggesting that house prices and stock prices do not play the role of a transmission mechanism for monetary policy shocks. When house prices increase, stock prices undergo a simultaneous and significant increase, but this effect gradually disappears. As house prices increase, the interest rate is simultaneously and positively affected; this effect is insignificant until after the second quarter. As stock prices increase, house prices are positively affected, which is consistent with the sign of the expected value, but the effect is insignificant. Under increasing stock prices, the interest rate simultaneously increases, and this effect is significant during the third and tenth quarters.

T2  - South Asian Journal of Macroeconomics and Public Finance
AB  - The present study estimates various specifications of the New Keynesian Phillips Curve (NKPC) models for India over 1996Q2 to 2017Q2 using Consumer Price Index (CPI) and Wholesale Price Index (WPI) inflation, separately. The empirical results suggest that the data support all the specifications of the Phillips curve models based on both the CPI and WPI inflations. However, the backward looking and hybrid models provide robust results for both the inflation indices. While the forward-looking behaviour dominates the CPI inflation trajectory, the backward-looking behaviour greatly influences the trajectory of WPI inflation. Also, a small-to-moderate degree of persistence is evident in both the CPI and WPI inflation. The output gap, which mainly represents the demand side pressures, turns up the major force determining both the CPI and WPI inflations. Besides the output gap, real effective exchange rate (reer), international crude oil price inflation, global non-fuel commodity price inflation and rainfall have a modest impact on the CPI and WPI inflations.JEL Classification: E12, E52, C36, C14

T2  - Sustainability
AB  - The Global Financial Crisis (GFC) will cause turbulence in the pharmaceutical market and the stagnation of market liquidity, leading to a deep recession in the pharmaceutical economy. After the COVID-19 outbreak, the pharmaceutical economic recession and the rising pharmaceutical financial crisis caused by the closure and control of the COVID-19 outbreak in China were important reasons for the accumulation of systemic financial risks in China. To realize the pharmaceutical economy and financial stability, this paper studies the weakening mechanism of the stabilization effect in systemic risk scenarios and analyzes how the evolution of systemic risk under the COVID-19 shock affects the stabilization effect of monetary policy. Under the COVID-19 shock, in the stage of falling China Financial Stress Index (CFSI), the systemic risk is relatively low, and the impact of traditional policy on macroeconomic stability is more significant; in the rising stage of CFSI, the systemic risk is relatively high, and the impact of traditional policy on macroeconomic stability is limited. This paper develops a Time-Varying Modified CRITIC weighting method and constructs a Time-Varying CFSI. This paper identifies systemic risk scenarios under the COVID-19 shock based on the Markov-Switching Mean Heteroskedastic Vector Auto-Regressive (MSMH-VAR) model and evaluates the stabilizing effects of monetary policy in different economic and financial regional systems (normal times and systemic risk scenarios). The results show that in normal times, loose monetary policy increases price levels, and tight monetary policy reduces price levels with a time lag. In systemic risk scenarios under the COVID-19 shock, the easing effect of policy on output growth is relatively small, and tighter policy increases output growth and prices in the short run and increases volatility in output growth and price levels in the long run. That is, under the COVID-19 shock in systemic risk scenarios, it is difficult to achieve stable growth and stable prices with monetary policy, and the stabilization effect is weakened. This paper focuses on the relationship between systemic risks, monetary policy, and output stability under the COVID-19 shock, analyzes the weakening of stabilization effects after the crisis, and expands the theoretical path of monetary policy stabilization and enriches the research scope of the new framework.

TI  - Should Monetary Policy Pay Attention to House Prices? The Czech National Bank's Approach
AU  - Hampl, Mojmír
AU  - Havranek, Tomas
AB  - Monetary and macroprudential policies are interconnected parts of the twin mandate of many central banks. We describe the Czech National Bank’s approach to one aspect of integrating these two policies, namely the use of a broader inflation measure that includes house prices and enters monetary policy considerations along with headline consumer price index (CPI) inflation. We further argue that, in terms of theory, the broader inflation gauge is at least as suitable as headline CPI for measuring the value of money, but we also acknowledge the practical problems that arise from the use of the broader index.

TI  - Welfare Effects of Monetary Policy Rules in a Model with Nominal Rigidities and Credit Market Frictions
AU  - Paustian, Matthias
AB  - This paper evaluates monetary policy rules in a business cycle model with staggered prices and wage setting a la Calvo and asymmetric information in the credit market. Rules are compared in a utility based welfare metric, the effects of the model’s nonlinear dynamics are captured by a quadratic approximation to the policy function. The ﬁrms net worth crucially affects the terms of obtaining outside ﬁnance. Financial frictions dampen the economy’s response to shocks and make them more persistent. For the baseline calibration, the welfare costs of price stickiness are found to be less than 0.04 per cent of steady state consumption. However, wage stickiness can induce welfare costs of up to 0.85 per cent of steady state consumption. An interest rate rule that places high weight on stabilizing wage inﬂation can eliminate most of these costs. These ﬁndings are by and large independent of the existence of other real distortions in the model, namely credit frictions.

AU  - Ajayi, Oluwafemi Isaac

T2  - Journal of Global Economics and Business
AB  - The study examined monetary policy regimes and price stability in the West African Monetary zone. This was undertaken given that countries in the zone are implementing different monetary policy regimes to achieve price stability for macroeconomic stability and economic growth, yet these have been elusive. So, the objective of the study was to examine the effect of monetary policy regimes on price stability in the West African monetary zone. The study adopted an ex-post facto research design and obtained secondary data from documents of the Central Banks of the WAMZ countries, the World Bank Development Indicator (WDI), the International Monetary Fund (IMF), and the International Financial Statistics (IFS) database for the period from 2001 to 2021. The method of data analysis involved the use of descriptive and analytical statistical tools. The estimation technique employed was the Panel Autoregressive Distribution Lag model, complemented by the Juodis, Karavias, and Sarafidis (2021) granger-causality test. The findings of the study indicate that the various monetary policy regimes being implemented in the West African Monetary Zone yielded conflicting effects on price stability. On the whole, the results show that the monetary policy rate against the money supply is more effective to achieve price stability in the West African monetary zone. Hence, the study makes the following recommendations; policymakers must ensure that an effective monetary policy is put in place to curb the persistent inflation in the zone that undermines socioeconomic development. Countries should review monetary policy rates appropriately to stimulate output growth, and, there should be cooperation between the monetary and fiscal authorities in the West African Monetary Zone to ensure smooth coordination and consistency in monetary and fiscal pursuits.

TI  - Monetary policy during financial crises: Is the transmission mechanism impaired?
AU  - Jannsen, Nils
AU  - Potjagailo, Galina
AU  - Wolters, Maik H.
AB  - We study the macroeconomic effects of monetary policy during financial crises using a Bayesian panel vector autoregressive (PVAR) model for 20 advanced economies. We interact all of the endogenous variables with financial crisis dummies, which are constructed using the narrative approach. We also distinguish between an acute initial phase of financial crises and a subsequent recovery phase. We show that an expansionary monetary policy shock has large positive effects on output and inflation during the acute phase of a financial crisis. These effects are larger than those during non-crisis periods. Decreased uncertainty as well as increases in consumer confidence and share prices explain these large effects, whereas these variables are much less relevant for monetary policy transmission outside financial crises. Counterfactual analysis shows that the transmission mechanism would be impaired without the effects of monetary policy on these variables, where credit would not react at all and the response of output would be substantially lower. During the recovery phase of a financial crisis, output and inflation are generally non-responsive to monetary policy shocks.

TI  - Monetary Policy Transmission in Canada: A FAVAR Analysis
AU  - Ji, Jiangnan
AB  - This paper employs the Factor Augmented Vector Autoregression (FAVAR) method used in Boivin, Giannoni and Stevanovic (2010) to analyze traditional channels of monetary policy transmission in Canada and to estimate the industrial and provincial effects of monetary policy. The benchmark model includes 409 quarterly macroeconomic time series from 1981Q2 to 2016Q2. The impulse response results are broadly consistent with the theoretical prediction of a small open economy model, except for CPI and total exports that are relatively nonresponsive to the monetary policy shock. The identified monetary policy shocks have heterogeneous sectorial effects, which are the largest for industrial GDP in manufacturing and wholesale trade, and for employment in manufacturing and construction. Furthermore, this paper finds that there are provincial differences in the responses to monetary policy shocks, with employment in Quebec and Ontario and housing price in Ontario and British Columbia being the most affected.

TI  - Interactions between Asset Prices and Monetary Policy in Taiwan: A Structural VAR Model
AU  - Lee, Chun-Chang
T2  - British Journal of Economics, Management & Trade
AB  - Aims: This paper analyzes the role of house prices in monetary policy transmission
mechanisms in Taiwan using structural VAR (SVAR). The discussion of the role of asset
prices in the monetary policy transmission mechanism can help us determine the
effectiveness of monetary policy.
Results: The contemporaneous effect of contractionary monetary policy on house prices
exhibits a significant and positive relationship, and the response gradually approaches
zero. The contemporaneous effect of contractionary monetary policy on stock prices is
negative and statistically insignificant. The empirical results of this study may not support
the transmission role of house and stock prices due to the low interest rate and the
possibility of non-banking system channels of investment and consumption capital
sources. Shocks to house and stock prices have no simultaneous impact on monetary policy; the impact gradually appears in the third or fourth quarter after such shocks.
Conclusion: The result suggests that the asset market plays a prominent role in the
Taiwan monetary policy setting, though the immediate response is small.

AU  - Jato, Terungwa Paul
AB  - This study examined the effect of monetary policy on price stability in Nigeria using a data-rich framework spanning from 1986-2020 with the interest in exploring which of monetary policy has been effective in propelling price stability and how inflation responds to the monetary policy implementation. The main problem with the macro-economic policies that prompted this study was the fact that despite the series of the CBN Monetary Policy Committee decisions there is apparently no useful effect on inflation (price stability). The study employed Auto-regression Distributed Lag (ARDL) Bound Test for Co-integration of data analysis and Error Correction Model (ECM) estimation. The ADF test revealed that, inflation (INF), exchange rate (EXR) and broad money supply (M2) were stationary at first difference 1(1); while monetary policy rate (MPR) and real interest rate (RIR) were stationary at level 1(0). The results of the ARDL bounds revealed that the null hypothesis of no longrun relationship were all rejected implying that a long-run effect exists among monetary policy variables and price stability. ECM coefficient of -0.0151 conforms with expectation. Durbin-Watson statistic of 2.2381 revealed that the model seems not to have any case of autocorrelation. The result of our analysis shows that EXR, M2, and MPR have negative and insignificant on price stability, while RIR has negative and significant on price stability. The study concluded that monetary policy in Nigeria is does has insignificant impact on general piece stability. We, therefore, recommended that, for monetary policy to be more effective in ensuring price stability in Nigeria, the Central Bank of Nigeria should promote policies for greater financial inclusion.

AB  - Previous empirical study on the effects of monetary policy shocks in small open economies has generated puzzling dynamic responses in various macroeconomic variables. This paper argues that these puzzles derive from an identification of monetary policy that is inappropriate for such economies. To remedy this, it is proposed that a structural model be estimated to explicitly account for the features of the small open economy. Such a model is applied to Canada with tightly estimated results overall. The dynamic responses to the identified monetary policy shock are consistent with standard theory and highlight the exchange rate as a transmission mechanism.

TI  - A Tale of Three Prices: Monetary Policy and Autonomous Consumption in the US
AU  - Góes, Maria Cristina Barbieri
AB  - The paper empirically assesses the role of real estate prices, housing rent, consumer prices, and monetary policy in an amended version of the Sraﬃan Supermultiplier Model. To do this, six diﬀerent Structural VAR models are estimated on US quarterly data for the period 1970-2020. The estimations suggest that the own interest rate (Sraﬀa, 1932; Teixeira, 2015) produces more persistent and statistically signiﬁcant eﬀects on autonomous consumption and on output than the real interest rate. The implication of these results is twofold. First, these ﬁndings conﬁrm the hypothesis that monetary policy transmission passes through autonomous consumption, in particular via changes in house prices. Second, the persistence of the eﬀect of autonomous consumption on output reaﬃrms its long run implications that goes beyond the business cycle, in line with the recent literature on autonomous demand-led growth. Furthermore, after the inclusion of rents and the overall price level, a positive monetary policy shock leads to an increase in rents, while housing prices decrease and the overall price level increases, giving a possible explanation of the Gibson’s Paradox. This contradictory movement in rent prices explains part of the price puzzle since shelter has a signiﬁcant impact as one of the main components of the Consumer Price Index (Dias and Duarte, 2019). These latter results open a path for the discussion of the linkages between monetary policy and distribution, since recent expansionary monetary policy did not fail to translate into worsening house aﬀordability leading to a decrease in home-ownership (particularly aﬀecting lower-income households). In this sense, it is evident that autonomous consumption has to move in step rather than detached from income distribution, making the case for income and redistribution policies.

TI  - Monetary Policy and Financial Stability: Is Inflation Targeting Passé?
AU  - Ito, Takatoshi
AB  - It would be easy to say that central banks should consider asset prices as one of the objectives to avoid boom and bust cycles, as happened in the 2007-2009 crisis; the dotcom bubble of 2001; and the Japanese boom and bust of the 1980s and 1990s. However, its implementation would be theoretically and empirically difficult since the monetary policy instrument, narrowly defined, is just the interest rate. Flexible inflation targeting (FIT) is basically a sound monetary policy framework even after experiencing a severe financial crisis, as what originated in the United States. Assigning too much weight to asset prices as a monetary policy objective would cause a serious tradeoff problem. Consumer price index deflation may have to be tolerated to avoid an asset bubble, which would be a serious problem, since once a bubble is formed, a slight increase in the interest rate would not stop it. The first-best policy is to enhance supervision and regulation of financial institutions to avoid moral hazard and concentration of risk.

AB  - This paper examines the impact of oil price, as a cause of economic crisis, and monetary policy through the four known channels of monetary transmission mechanism (interest rate, exchange rate, domestic credit, and stock price). Using a structural VAR model based on monthly data from 2002 to 2013 for ASEAN-4 countries, oil price and monetary transmission channels are compared pre- and post-crisis. The result indicates oil price remains an important factor in explaining price volatility, even though oil price has a weaker effect compared to a stronger effect of monetary transmission mechanism on prices. Stock price for Malaysia and domestic credit for the three others can affect the prices against oil price shock. Unlike prices, the output of all countries except Thailand is more affected by oil price post-crisis compared to pre-crisis. Different monetary transmission tools affecting industrial production are compared for the four countries.

AU  - Hanson, Michael S.
T2  - Journal of Monetary Economics
AB  - A large literature has employed structural vector autoregressive (SVAR) models to investigate the empirical effects of U.S. monetary policy. Many of these models regularly produce a “price puzzle”—a rise in the aggregate price level in response to a contractionary innovation to monetary policy—unless commodity prices are included. Conventional wisdom maintains that commodity prices resolve the price puzzle because they contain information that helps the Federal Reserve forecast inflation. I examine a number of plausible alternative indicator variables and find little correlation between an ability to forecast inflation and an ability to resolve the price puzzle. Additionally, a sub-sample investigation reveals that evidence of a price puzzle is associated primarily with the 1959–1979 sample period, and that most indicators—including commodity prices—cannot resolve the puzzle over this period.

AB  - In this paper, we will analyze monetary policy of the Bank of Japan, the central bank of Japan, under the second Abe Cabinet term which started in December 2012. The Bank set the "price stability target" at 2 percent in terms the year-on-year rate of change in the consumer price index in January 2013 and has made a commitment to achieving this target at the earliest possible time. The Abe Cabinet's policy feature was monetary easing from the start. At the Monetary Policy Meeting held on October 31, 2014, the Bank decided monetary easing by accelerating the pace of increase in the monetary base and by increasing asset purchases and extending the average remaining maturity of Japanese government bond purchases. We analyzed the Monetary Policy Meeting minutes by text mining technologies. Especially we conducted a topic extraction using the Latent Dirichlet Allocation model from the Meeting minutes from January 2013 to June 2014. The extracted topics clearly showed their monetary easing policies. In addition, we found that a topic corresponding to the consumption tax hike held on April first, 2014 of which topic ratio increased in the last of 2013.

AB  - Vietnam is an Asian emerging country, which now is ranked in the group of the fastest-growing economies worldwide. However, this economy has faced galloping inﬂation in recent years. So the Vietnamese experience is a valuable reference for the policymakers in the developing world in order to successfully control price volatility. Our study applies the Vector autoregressive method, the Johansen cointegration test, and the Granger causality test to examine the impact of ﬁscal and monetary policy on price volatility in Vietnam with a quarterly data sample collected over the period from 2004 to 2018. e study results conﬁrm the existence of a long-term cointegration relationship between these policies and price volatility in Vietnam. Besides, the variance decomposition and impulse response function also show that the impact of these policies on inﬂation is clear, however, the ﬁscal policy more strongly aﬀects inﬂation than the monetary policy. Finally, the Granger causality test also indicates one-way causality relationships from the government expenditure as well as the exchange rate to price volatility in the study period.

TI  - Owner Occupied Housing in the CPI and Its Impact on Monetary Policy During Housing Booms and Busts
AU  - Hill, Robert J.
AU  - Steurer, Miriam
AU  - Waltl, Sofie R.
AB  - The treatment of owner-occupied housing (OOH) is probably the most important unresolved issue in inflation measurement. The European Union has been grappling with this problem for over a decade. We argue for measuring OOH costs using a particular version of the user cost method. We then compare the impact of eight different treatments of OOH on the consumer price index (CPI), using quantile hedonic regression. The impact on the CPI is large, and the treatment of OOH emerges as an essential prerequisite to discussions over how an inflation targeting central bank should respond to housing booms and busts.

TI  - Monetary policy reaction function pre and post the global financial crisis
AU  - Raputsoane, Leroi
AB  - This paper analyses the monetary policy reaction function pre and post the recent global financial
crisis in South Africa. This is achieved by comparing the reaction function of the the monetary policy
interest rate to changes in the target variables that comprise the inflation rate, output gap and financial
stress index pre and post the recent global financial crisis. The results show a negligible reaction of the
monetary policy to changes in inflation in the pre and post the recent global financial crisis period. The
results further show a relatively loose monetary policy stance during the financially stressful economic
conditions in the pre and post the recent global financial crisis period. Most importantly, the results
show that the reaction of monetary policy to changes in the target variables pre the recent global
financial crisis period has not changed significantly compared to post the recent global financial crisis
period. Therefore the paper concludes that there is no material difference in the conduct of monetary
policy by the monetary authority in South Africa pre and post the recent global financial crisis.

AB  - Purpose – The purpose of this paper is to investigate the effectiveness of asset price channel in monetary policy transmission and the effect of stock market volatility on monetary policy in Kenya. Design/methodology/approach – Empirical analysis is based on quantitative analysis which incorporates both descriptive analysis and empirical approach. The study specifically uses the VAR approach which is most appropriate for this kind of study involving analysis of policy shocks on macroeconomic variables. Findings – The main findings of this paper are as follows: first, the evidence of the existence of the asset price channel of monetary policy transmission is mixed in Kenya. Second, while the effect of monetary policy on stock price volatility is not significant, stock market volatility creates instability in monetary policy variables, implying that information from the stock market may be important in predicting the business cycle. Originality/value – The paper provides useful policy insights to academicians, economists and central bankers who are interested in understanding the financial stability‐monetary policy nexus. This is important considering that most economies are emerging from the effects of the global financial crisis and they are thus enhancing financial stability measures. No such study that the authors are aware of has been conducted using data for Kenya.

T2  - Journal of Computational Social Science
AB  - This study reviews and assesses the monetary policy implemented by the Bank of Japan (BOJ), focusing on policies that employ short-term interest rates as the operational target. Our review of empirical studies on monetary policy that influenced the BOJ’s policy reveals that they focused on (1) banking system and interest rate mechanisms, (2) financial deregulation and monetary aggregates, (3) the systematic reaction regarding the achievement of the ultimate goal, and (4) confirming how certain evidence serves as material for policy judgments and communication with the public. Our empirical results on the causal effect of monetary policy in the framework of a structural vector autoregressive model attest to the significant impact of Japan’s monetary policy on the financial market and macroeconomy from the 1980s onward. Our counterfactual simulations affirm that the central bank should consistently shift its policy stance to achieve macroeconomic stability. Even small policy rate cuts in a low-interest-rate environment make significant contributions to economic recovery.

AU  - Warne, Anders
AB  - This paper presents estimates of the effects of monetary policy shocks on the Swedish economy. A theoretical model of an open economy is used to identify a structural VAR model. The empirical results from the identified VAR model are compared with two less structural approaches for identification of monetary policy shocks. The first assumes that shocks can be measured as deviations from a forward looking interest rate rule, estimated using Sveriges Riksbank's (Swedish central bank) own forecasts. The second approach focuses on the effects of narrative monetary policy shocks as given by devaluations of the Swedish currency. We find that plausible theoretical restrictions often result in price puzzles. Although conventional results obtain with certain theoretical restrictions imposed on the VAR, another way to achieve this is by using external information about large policy shocks. Thus, we find that the effects of some devaluations are consistent with the conventional wisdom about the effects of monetary policy shock.

AB  - In recent years, People’s Bank of China has taken strong monetary policies for many times, thus leading to the slow-down of the rise of CPI. However, the mutual effects between the real economy and people’s inflation expectation lead the CPI to fluctuate more uncertainly, and then cause the increase of inflation uncertainty. This article draws the conclusion that inflation uncertainty has a significantly negative influence on the real GDP. Moreover, although the aggressive monetary policy is effective in the short term, the effects are declining in the long run.

AB  - Inflation is recurrent and relatively strong in Haiti, a small Caribbean open economy plagued by debilitating factors including sluggish economic growth and low saving rates. The inflation process is fed by a permanent monetary expansion, consistent with standard theory. The monetary effect is also amplified by other factors such as inertia, price-setting behavior in the stagnating economy, and by the effects of relative price changes, particularly the pass-through of exchange rate changes on the consumer price index (CPI). The chapter investigates the effects—and their strength—on the dynamics of inflation in Haiti with some conventional econometric methods using quarterly data from different sources including the central bank from 1996 to 2018. It also analyzes the strength and the stability of this dynamics—and quite complex—relationship. Finally, it brings out how the monetary policy impacts their relationship, and the impediments that prevent the monetary policy framework from being effective in stabilizing inflation in Haiti.

TI  - Monetary Policy, Commodity Prices and Inflation - Empirical Evidence from the US
AU  - Verheyen, Florian
AB  - The past years were characterized by unprecedented rises in prices of commodities such as oil or wheat and inflation rates moved up above the mark of two percent per annum. This led to a revival of the debate whether commodity prices indicate future CPI inflation and if they can be used as indicator variables for central banks or not. We apply various econometric methods like Granger causality tests and SVAR models to US data. The results corroborate the notion that there was a strong link between commodity prices and CPI inflation in the 1970s and the beginning of the 1980s. For a more recent sample, the relationship has weakened, respectively diminished.

In individual Euro Area (EA) member countries, economic activity increases, mainly via the trade channel. Also, domestic credit and stock markets expand, highlighting the importance of the financial channel. However, the international repercussions are transitory and distributed unevenly within the EA. The effect diminishes as EA interest rates increase with a few quarters delay. While the effects are heterogenous and rather large before 1999, responses become more homogeneous and smaller in size after the implementation of the euro. Still, country-specific asymmetries remain.

TI  - The Impact of Inflation Targeting on Macroeconomic Indicators in Ukraine
AU  - Zherlitsyn, Dmytro
AB  - The correlation between macroeconomic dynamics and the inflation rate is the subject of many economic studies. The principles of monetary policy are developed in classical economics studies, which are based on the theories of Keynes, Phillips, Campbell, etc. However, classic approaches require practical validation, especially with regard to modern economic trends in times of crisis and emerging economies. Therefore, the purpose of the paper is to investigate and summarize the impact of inflation targeting and other key monetary policy instruments on fundamental economic indicators in Ukraine during periods of stability and crises. An empirical analysis is based on official statistics from Ukraine for 2011–2019. This study uses econometric methods (multivariate regression and simultaneous equation model), which are applied for the general and transmission impact of inflation on the estimation of economic growth. The results prove that inflation does not affect (less than 0.46 linear correlation) fundamental economic indicators during periods of real GDP growth and a quarterly CPI level of less than 2%. On the other hand, there are significant simultaneous regressions (more than 0.8 coefficients of determination) between unemployed, spending on real final consumption, hryvnia exchange rate and monetary policy instruments (discount rate, international reserves, amount of government bonds, M3 monetary aggregate) for periods when the quarterly CPI (consumer price index) is more than 2%. Therefore, the traditional monetary policy implications are discussed for emerging economies.

TI  - Why Leaning Against the Wind Is the Wrong Monetary Policy for Sweden
AU  - Svensson, Lars E O
AB  - Should inflation targeting involve some leaning against the wind? Sweden provides a case study, since the Riksbank has been leaning against the wind quite aggressively since 2010, stating concerns about risks associated with household indebtedness. The cost is high of this policy, in the form of inflation much below the target and a higher unemployment, arguably as much 1.2 percentage points higher than necessary. In contrast, according to the Riksbank’s own calculations, the benefits of a higher policy rate in terms of a lower probability and less depth of a future crisis is miniscule. Expressed in the form of a lower expected future unemployment rate, the benefit is only about 0.004 of the cost in the form of a higher unemployment rate the next few years. Furthermore, much lower inflation than expected has actually substantially increased households’ debt burden and, if anything, increased any risks. During the last two and a half years, the real value of a given loan has become 5 percent larger than if inflation had been on target.

AB  - This study analyses the potential transmission of China’s monetary policy shocks to equity markets in Southeast Asia. Impulse response functions indicate that the impact of a monetary expansion in China is significant and positive for four of the five Southeast Asian equity markets. One explanation for this result is that monetary policy shocks in China lead to an increase in demand for goods and services in both China and abroad, which then shows up in the foreign equity market. The results in this paper provide evidence of China’s influence in Southeast Asia and its financial markets. The transmission effect is small and very short lived, but can be expected to increase if the current trends of a deepening economic integration between China and Southeast Asia and a maturing Chinese central bank continue.

Our key results indicate that contractionary monetary policy shocks have positive effects on commodity prices during both conventional and unconventional monetary policy periods, indicating the effectiveness of unconventional monetary policy tools. The largest impact is documented on energy (fuel) and food commodities. Our results also suggest that the effect of ECB monetary policy on commodity prices transmits through the exchange rate channel, which influences European market demand.

AB  - This study examines how monetary policy affected crude oil prices after the subprime mortgage crisis. Our earlier research found that easy monetary policy had a significant impact on energy prices during the period of 1980–2011. This paper finds that after the subprime mortgage crisis, the weaker exchange rate of the US dollar caused by the country's quantitative easing pushed oil prices in US dollars upward over the period of 2009–2012, by causing investors to invest in the oil market and other commodity markets while the world economy was in recession in this period. This trend had the effect of imposing a longer recovery time on the global economy, as oil has been shown to be one of the most important production inputs.

The new procedure is illustrated by exploring the tightness of money during the recent three-year period of “monetarist” Federal Reserve policy. When measured by a properly constructed statistical index number, the rate of growth of the money supply is found to have been lower and more volatile than when measured by the official simple sum monetary aggregates. As a result, targeting the simple sum aggregates may have induced a tighter and more volatile policy than was intended.

It identifies pure monetary policy shocks by purging them of the bias stemming from contemporaneous central bank information effects. The results suggest that there is a hierarchy in the global spillovers from ECB and Federal Reserve monetary policy: while the spillovers to consumer prices are relatively small in both directions, Federal Reserve monetary policy shocks have a larger impact on euro area financial markets and real activity. Federal Reserve monetary policy also has a significantly larger impact than ECB monetary policy on real and financial variables in the rest of the world.

AB  - March 2011 marked the introduction of the Magyar Nemzeti Bank's Monetary Policy Model (MPM), representing a paradigm shift in both macroeconomic projection and monetary policy decision support. In contrast to previous conditional projections, the MPM provides an endogenous definition of both the projected policy rate and the projected exchange rate. Given the forward-looking nature of the model, expectations of economic agents play a key role in the monetary transmission process; therefore, the future achievement of the inflation target is guaranteed by the projected path of the interest rate over the forecast horizon. In this paper, we discuss the underlying structure and logic behind the MPM, describe the key behavioural equations and examine how the channels of monetary transmission appear in the model. In addition, we present the empirical validation process in detail from calibration, through Bayesian estimation and discussion of the economic properties of the model to the historical projection exercise. Finally, we discuss the main challenges we faced during the first year of application.

Unlike previous research, the data-based analysis reveals differences in the output and price effects of the Bank of Japan’s, Federal Reserve’s and European Central Bank’s balance sheet operations.

TI  - Monetary Policy in a Small Open Economy with Imperfect Pass-Through
AU  - Douch, Mohamed
T2  - Atlantic Economic Journal
AB  - This paper studies the stabilization and welfare properties of various monetary policy regimes in a tractable framework suitable for the analysis of monetary policy in a small open economy environment with imperfect pass-through and inflation indexation. Using welfare criteria to evaluate the best monetary policy, results show that price-level targeting performs well and provides an alternative method for conducting successful monetary policy in the case of a small-open economy. Benefits of price-level targeting rules noted in the literature for closed economies also translate to the small open economy setting once allowing for the combination of inflation inertia and exchange rate imperfect pass-through. As the exchange rate is an important element of the transmission of monetary policy, movements in these variable and other foreign variables often account for a significant part of the variation in the consumer price index via their direct effect on the price of imported goods. Imperfect exchange rate pass-through favors the choice of price-level targeting over consumer price index inflation targeting.

TI  - A VAR Analysis of the Effects of Monetary Policy in East Asia
AU  - Fung, Ben S. C.
AB  - In this paper, a VAR model is used to study the effects of monetary policy shocks in seven East Asian economies. For each economy, the same identification scheme is imposed and the dynamic responses to a monetary shock are examined in the light of the predictions of monetary theory. The results suggest that the VAR model produces sensible impulse response functions for most of the economies, especially for the sample that ends before the 1997 Asian financial crisis. Given the openness of these economies, the exchange rate plays a significant role in the formulation of monetary policy. In order to capture explicitly the importance of the exchange rate in these economies, plausible weights are also imposed on the exchange rate to identify the model.

AU  - Dixon, Huw David

AB  - In this paper, we use an open economy model of the United Kingdom to examine the extent to which monetary policy should respond to movements in sectoral inflation rates.  To do this we construct a Generalised Taylor model that takes specific account of the sectoral make up of the consumer price index (CPI), where the sectors are based on the COICOP classification the UK CPI microdata.  We calibrate the model for each sector using the UK CPI microdata and model the sectoral shocks that drive sectoral inflation rates as white noise processes, as in the UK data.  We find that a policy rule that allows for different responses to inflation in different sectors outperforms a rule which just targets aggregate CPI.  However, the gain is small and comes from partially looking through movements in aggregate inflation driven by movements in petrol price inflation, which is volatile and tends not to reflect underlying inflationary pressure.

AB  - This chapter investigates the extent to which fiscal spending cuts impact inflation and whether the effects are constrained by monetary policy cycles. In addition, are the effects exacerbated by the GDP growth? Evidence shows that fiscal spending cuts lower inflation but the effects are greater in the tighter monetary policy regimes than in the accommodative regimes. This is because a pronounced decline in GDP growth worsens the decline in inflation in the tight monetary policy regime. In addition, the fiscal spending shocks have greater adverse effects on inflation when the tax policy is endogenous in the model compared to when it is exogenous. This shows that allowing for the feedback effects leads to a greater impact on GDP growth and a pronounced decline in inflation than when the feedback effects are not allowed. This implies that the state of GDP growth and the spill-over effects of fiscal policy do depend on monetary policy regimes.

AU  - Cho, Yujeong
AU  - Kim, Soyoung
AB  - This study investigates the transmission mechanism of Chinese monetary policy shocks to other East Asian countries using a VAR model and focusing on their effects on the trade channel. The main empirical results are as follows. First, in response to Chinese expansionary monetary policy shocks, exports from East Asian countries to China decrease and imports into East Asian countries from China increase, via the expenditure switching effect. Second, final goods exports from East Asian countries to China increase through the income absorption effect. Third, and most interestingly, intermediate goods exports from East Asian countries to China increase, which is the consequence of the vertical trade structure across the East Asian region. Overall, East Asian economies’ exports to China increase and their trade balance with China improves in the medium- and long run.

AB  - Disinflation in Israel has been a relatively slow process. It took more than a decade for the annual rate of inflation to fall from about 18 percent in the late 1980s to less than 4 percent in the late 1990s. For 2000 and 2001 the government has set an inflation target range of 3 to percent. Whether low inflation will be a permanent feature of the Israeli economy remains to be seen.

AU  - Fu, Qiang

T2  - China Journal of Accounting Research
AB  - We investigate monetary policy effects on corporate investment adjustment, using a sample of China’s A-share listed firms (2005–2012), under an asymmetic framework and from a monetary policy transmission channel perspective. We find that corporate investment adjustment is faster in expansionary than contractionary monetary policy periods. Monetary policy has a significant effect on adjustment speed through monetary and credit channels. An increase in the growth rate of money supply or credit accelerates adjustment. Both effects are significantly greater during tightening than expansionary periods. The monetary channel has significant asymmetry, whereas the credit channel has none. Leverage moderates the relationship between monetary policy and adjustment, with a greater effect in expansionary periods. This study enriches the corporate investment behavior literature and can help governments develop and optimize macro-control policies.

AB  - We employ the SVAR model to examine the impact of U.S. monetary policy shock on the Chinese real output and inflation. Our main result shows that the effect of transmission of short-term international capital flows is stronger than the balance of trade and the world commodity prices index. The exchange rate of RMB has the weakest transmission effect. Expansionary monetary policy shocks of the United States will increase real output and consumer price index of China and the United States; but the U.S. real output growth is higher than that of China; China’s consumer price index rise higher than that of United States. Based on this, China should gradually adjust economic growth model, increased the per capita disposable income and strengthen regulate the speculative short-term international capital flows.

AB  - The paper discusses the choice between inflation targeting and monetary targeting for the Eurosystem, the announced Eurosystem strategy, the appropriate framework for policy decisions, exchange rate management in the EMU, and Eurosystem accountability and transparency. The announced monetary strategy is deficient, since it proposes a prominent role for an essentially irrelevant money-growth indicator in analysis and communication, but will keep secret the inflation forecast that will, in practice, be the decisive input in policy decisions. Effective outside monitoring and evaluation of Eurosystem policy decisions seem to require published inflation forecasts and Governing Council minutes and voting records.

AB  - We develop a factor-augmented vector autoregression (FA-VAR) model to estimate the effects that unanticipated changes in U.S. monetary policy and economic policy uncertainty have on the Chinese housing, equity, and loan markets. We find the decline in the U.S. policy rate since the Great Recession has led to a significant increase in Chinese housing investment. One possible reason for this effect is the substantial increase in the inflow of “hot money” into China. The responses of Chinese variables to U.S. shocks at the zero lower bound are different from those responses in normal times.

TI  - Financial Variables and the Conduct of Monetary Policy
AU  - Goodhart, Charles
AU  - Hofmann, Boris
AB  - This paper analyses the role of financial variables in the conduct of monetary policy. In the baseline model for the analysis of interest rules, the inflation rate depends on the output gap, which is solely determined by its own lags and the lagged short-term real interest rate. However, from a theoretical point of view there are several other financial variables which may affect aggregate demand, and should therefore be taken into account in the estimation of an output gap equation. In order to assess the importance of financial variables such as asset prices and monetary aggregates for aggregate demand, we estimate a small structural model for 17 developed countries using quarterly data spanning 1973 - 1998. The results indicate that the effect of other financial variables, especially property and share prices, on the output gap is highly significant. It appears that in almost all of the countries in our data set it is necessary to control for the effect of other financial variables on the output gap in order to find a significant effect for monetary policy.

AB  - This article examines the impact of US monetary policy as the world dominant monetary policy on the global crude oil prices and investigates the impact of oil price fluctuations on two real macro variables (gross domestic product [GDP] and inflation rate) of three global major crude oil consumers: the People’s Republic of China (an emerging economy), and Japan and the United States (developed economies). To assess the relationship between monetary variables, crude oil prices and macro variables, the authors adopt an N-variable structural vector autoregression (SVAR) model. The results suggest that the monetary policy had a significant positive impact on oil prices during 2001–13 through two different channels (quantitative easing and exchange rate fluctuations). Also, the impact of oil price fluctuations on developed oil importers’ GDP growth is much milder than on the GDP growth of an emerging economy. However, the impact on the China’s inflation rate is found to be less severe compared to the two developed countries.

AU  - Camara, Santiago
AB  - This paper presents evidence of an informational effect in changes of the federal funds rate around FOMC announcements by exploiting exchange rate variations for a panel of emerging economies. For several FOMC announcements dates, emerging market economies' exchange rate strengthened relative to the US dollar, in contrast to what the standard theory predicts. These results are in line with the information effect, which denote the Federal Reserve's disclosure of information about the state of the economy. Using Jarocinski \& Karadi 2020's identification scheme relying on sign restrictions and high-frequency surprises of multiple financial instruments, I show how different US monetary policy shocks imply different spillovers on emerging markets financial flows and macroeconomic performance. I emphasize the contrast in dynamics of financial flows and equity indexes and how different exchange rate regimes shape aggregate fluctuations. Using a structural DSGE model and IRFs matching techniques I argue that ignoring information shocks bias the inference over key frictions for small open economy models.
