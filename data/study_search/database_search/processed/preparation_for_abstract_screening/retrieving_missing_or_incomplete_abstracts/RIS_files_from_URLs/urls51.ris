AB  - This paper draws some lessons from the crisis for the future conduct of monetary policy.  (1) We
argue that while relatively low policy rates compared to past experience contributed to the growth
in credit and the rise in house prices in the run‐up to the crisis, they played only a modest direct role.  
But the reduction in volatility associated with the Great Moderation, some of which is likely to have
been down to improved policy making, also appears to have had an effect.  (2) Central banks have
deployed a range of unorthodox policies during the crisis.  Those that support particular markets,
sectors or firms have no place in normal times.    Asset purchases designed to lower longer‐term
yields and boost asset prices more generally appear to have had some success but a short‐term
interest rate policy instrument represents a preferable monetary instrument in normal times.   (3)
The case for raising target inflation rates is unpersuasive, while the gains from moving to price‐level
targeting appear likely to be modest.  (4) The case for “leaning against the wind” by raising policy
rates higher than required to meet immediate inflation and output objectives appears strengthened
by recent events, but the collateral damage to output from a policy that is sufficiently aggressive to
make enough of a difference to credit conditions and asset prices is likely to be quite high.  
Development and deployment of a macro‐prudential policy toolkit focussed more directly on the
underlying source of the exuberance looks a more promising way forward.

AU  - Mishkin, Frederic S.
T2  - Journal of Money, Credit and Banking
AB  - The paper argues that many of the exaggerated claims that globalization has been an important factor in lowering inflation in recent years just do not hold up. Globalization does, however, have the potential to be stabilizing for individual economies and has been a key factor in promoting economic growth. The paper then examines four questions about the impact of globalization on the monetary transmission mechanism and arrives at the following answers: (i) Has globalization led to a decline in the sensitivity of inflation to domestic output gaps and thus to domestic monetary policy? No. (ii) Are foreign output gaps playing a more prominent role in the domestic inflation process, so that domestic monetary policy has more difficulty stabilizing inflation? No. (iii) Can domestic monetary policy still control domestic interest rates and so stabilize both inflation and output? Yes. (iv) Are there other ways, besides possible influences on inflation and interest rates, in which globalization may have affected the transmission mechanism of monetary policy? Yes.

AU  - Johnson, Karen

AB  - This paper explores issues that arise in implementing monetary policy under conditions of sustained price stability. We discuss several issues that concern the selection of a central bank's inflation objective: price measurement questions must be recognized in articulating the goals of monetary policy under sustained low inflation, questions about the behavior of other key nominal variables, particularly wages, when price increases are on average about zero, and the possibility of other channels through which conditions of very low inflation change relationships within the real economy. We present a framework for analyzing monetary policy reaction functions that can illuminate the choices facing policy makers in a regime of price stability. The zero lower bound on nominal interest rates is a potential constraint on monetary policy when nominal interest rates are low on average, which will tend to be the case when long-term inflation is low. We summarize the results of research done at the Federal Reserve to clarify these issues for the United States and consider the availability and effectiveness of alternative policy tools when the nominal interest rate is at the zero bound.

AB  - A growing number of countries are anchoring their monetary policy through explicit inflation targeting. This policy has already scored remarkable successes in several countries, establishing central bank credibility, and reining in inflation where it had long been stubbornly high. But implementing inflation targets raises many difficult questions. What prerequisites must an economy and its institutions meet for the strategy to work? What choices should central banks make from the menu of possible variations on the basic approach? This book summarizes the discussions in a seminar at which economists and policymakers from ten countries reviewed their experiences with inflation targeting.

TI  - Monetary Policy Channels of Pakistan and Their Impact on Real GDP and Inflation
AU  - Hussain, Karrar
T2  - CID Research Fellow and Graduate Student Working Paper Series
AB  - This paper is an attempt to estimate the relative impact of monetary policy on key economic variables i.e. output and inflation in Pakistan by covering the period from 1964-M1 to 2007-M12. For this purpose Vector Autoregression (VAR) approach is used, which is based on error correction model (ECM). We considered five pertinent channels through which monetary policy can affect economic activity of the country namely interest rate channel, exchange rate channel, government expenditure channel and credit channel. The objective of this paper is to identify the relative importance of each of these channels by employing Vector Autoregression (VAR) approach. We also generate Impulse Response Functions to confirm the response of a shock in a variable upon itself and other variables. Our study concludes that exchange rate is also a significant monetary policy instrument in Pakistan's case for both controlling inflation and minimizing output variance in the economy.

AB  - Impact of changes in policy rate of interest on demand for bank credit is examined for seven emerging market economies including India for the period 2002 to 2010. Panel data techniques are used after ruling out the presence of unit roots. The results show that when other determinants, like domestic demand pressure, export demand and impact of stock market signals are controlled for, change in policy rate of interest is an important determinant of firms' demand for bank credit. The results confirm that monetary policy is an important countercyclical tool for setting the pace of economic activity.

AB  - Issues of inflation measurement are fundamental to the conduct of monetary policy. Price indices form the foundation of central bank policy frameworks around the world. They serve as guides to decision-making, as well as providing the primary mechanism for holding independent policymakers accountable. To shed some light on the role of inflation measurement, the annual meeting of Deputy Governors of emerging market economies (EMEs), held in Basel on 5-6 February 2009, explored three issues: Price indices used by central banks; the role of wages and productivity in inflation policy; and the measurement and assessment of inflation expectations. This volume contains contributions by senior central bankers and BIS staff. The issues are summarised in an overview chapter by Stephen Cecchetti.

AB  - For some time now, monetary policy announcements have been mired with controversies, questioning the effectiveness or otherwise of the demand side management policy in Nigeria. Again, the transmission mechanisms of these policies and its effects on the economy have remained unclear to the public.&nbsp; It is against this backdrop that this study investigated the effects of monetary policy shocks on sectoral components of the Nigerian economy using the Structural Vector Autoregressive (SVAR) model from 1961 - 2019. The Impulse Response Function (IRFs) was performed within the framework of SVAR to analyze the effects of the unanticipated monetary policy shocks on various sectors. The broad money supply, credit to the private sector, exchange rate and liquidity ratios have positive effects on the aggregate output and some selected sectoral components while interest rate and consumer price index have negative effects. The IRFs showed that the effects of monetary policy goes beyond the current year of&nbsp; 3 to 6 years before stabilizing while sectoral components have similar responses to the various monetary policy shocks. The results clearly show that the liquidity ratio is the most effective instrument for the control of aggregate output and not interest rate while broad money supply seems to be the most effective monetary policy instrument for the control of various sectors of the economy. The study therefore recommended among others adequate management of money supply, credit control; interest rate and foreign exchange market liberalization for improving sectoral output in Nigeria.

uncertainty, which may amplify the negative effect of the crisis.
Based on several uncertainty measures, we show that inflation in
the euro area is negatively affected by higher uncertainty.
However, uncertainty does not impair the transmission of
monetary policy. Consequently, the ECB should consider
uncertainty in itsreaction function in order to fulfil its mandate.

TI  - Commodity Prices, Monetary Policy and the Taylor Rule
AU  - Siami-Namini, Sima
AB  - One way to analyze the impact of commodity price shocks on monetary policy is to think about short-term interest rates set by the Federal Reserve (Fed) according to the Taylor rule. Taylor (1993) suggested a policy reaction function for moderating short-term interest rates to achieve the two-fold goals of stabilizing economic growth in the short-term and inflation in the long-term. One important question is why monetary policy makers focus on core inflation instead of headline inflation. Therefore, the main goal of this research article is to study the pattern of monetary policy responses to commodity price shocks derived from an impulse response function (IRF). To do this, we first estimate two individual Taylor rules based on core and headline consumer price index (CPI) inflation by using real-time data of the US economy for the Greenspan years from 1987 to 2006 and predict the residuals. Then, we estimate two regressions for core and headline CPI inflation as our two individual dependent variables against some independent variables including commodity price shocks, and the Taylor rule residuals. At the end, we predict the monetary policy responses to commodity price shocks by using IRF analysis in multivariate systems of a vector autoregression (VAR) model.

TI  - Monetary Policy and Domestic Investment in Nigeria: The Role of the Inflation Rate
AU  - Ezeibekwe, Obinna Franklin
T2  - Economics and Business
AB  - AbstractEconomic theory suggests that monetary policy can be used to stabilize an economy. However, the ability of monetary policy targets—interest rates and money supply—to stabilize an economy depends on their ability to achieve price stability. Using data from 1981 to 2018 and applying the vector error correction model, this paper seeks to determine how the changes in the inflation rate affect the ability of monetary policy tools to stabilize the Nigerian economy and stimulate investment. Empirical results suggest that the impact of the interest rates on investment depends on the level of the inflation rate. The size of the effect of interest rates on investment gets weaker as the inflation rate increases suggesting that monetary policy tools, such as the monetary policy rate (MPR), that directly change the interest rates are robust stabilization tools during periods of declining inflation rates but not relevant during periods of rising inflation rates. This is attributable to low bank lending rates. Additionally, the impact of the money supply target on investment does not depend on the level of the inflation rate. This suggests that monetary policy tools, such as open market operations, that directly change the money supply can be relevant stabilization tools during

TI  - Recent Central-Bank Reforms and the Role of Price Stability as the Sole Objective of Monetary Policy
AU  - Walsh, Carl E.
T2  - NBER Macroeconomics Annual
AB  - Recent and prospective central banking reforms represent attempts to develop institutional solutions for the inflation bias that can arise under discretionary monetary policy. An alternative to mandated objectives or targeting requirements is offered by proposals to develop incentive contracts that base the central bank's rewards (or penalties) solely on the realized rate of inflation. Deriving optimal incentive schemes provides a normative benchmark against which central bank institutions can be compared. New Zealand's policy structure most resembles a performance contract; it has well-defined procedures for setting short-run targets and a system to ensure accountability. As yet, however, this system has not really been tested. In Europe, the emphasis has been on political independence. Less attention has been given to ensuring that the correct incentives for making short-run policy tradeoffs are established, nor has sufficient attention been placed on ensuring accountability.

to 2010:10. This approach is supposed to provide a more comprehensive and precise
forecast of the economy. The results from the impulse response function show that
the effect of the price puzzle is reduced with this approach. It is also found that
financial and real variables react negatively to the monetary policy shocks in line

Bayesian estimation of the parameters of the model indicates that they are relatively invariant to alternative policy assumptions and supports our view that the model parameters may be regarded as unaffected by the monetary policy specification. We discuss how monetary policy, and in particular the choice of output gap measure, affects the transmission of shocks. Finally, we use the model to assess the recent Great Recession in the world economy and how its impact on the economic development in Sweden depends on the conduct of monetary policy. This provides an illustration on how Rames incoporates large international spillover effects.

TI  - The Exchange Rate Pass-Through to Inflation and its Implications for Monetary Policy in Cameroon and Kenya
AU  - Revelli, Dongue Ndongo Patrick
AB  - Understanding how domestic prices adjust to the exchange rate enables us to
anticipate the effects on inflation and monetary policy responses. This study examines
the extent of the exchange rate pass-through to the Consumer Price Index in Cameroon
and Kenya over the 1991-2013 period. The results of its econometric analysis shows
that the degree of the exchange rate pass-through is incomplete and varied between
0.18 and 0.58 over one year in Kenya, while it varied between 0.53 and 0.89 over
the same period in Cameroon. For the long term, it was found to be equal to 1.06 in
Kenya and to 0.28 in Cameroon. A structural VAR analysis using impulse-response
functions supported the results for the short term but found a lower degree of passthrough for the exchange rate shocks: 0.3125 for Kenya and 0.4510 for Cameroon. It
follows from these results that the exchange rate movements remain a potentially
important source of inflation in the two countries. Variance decomposition shows
that the contribution of the exchange rate shocks is modest in the case of Kenya but
significant in that of Cameroon.

AB  - This paper uses Structural Vector Autoregressive (SVAR) method to measure the regional effects of monetary policy in China during 1978–2011. The results provide evidence of different regional responses of real variables to monetary policy shocks. This paper proves that M2 is a better monetary policy indicator. We also find that when examining the regional effects of monetary policy in China, the spillover effects among regions are very important in the short run. In the long run, the influence of deposits transfer among regions is much bigger than that of the spillover effects.

T2  - International Review of Economics & Finance
AB  - This study empirically investigated the effects of monetary policy shocks on farm prices and exchange rates by using vector auto-regression models with sign restrictions on impulse responses. The main empirical results are as follows. First, contractionary monetary policy shocks have significant negative effects on real farm prices, which suggests that farm prices respond more to monetary policy shocks than to the general price level. Second, the effects of monetary policy shocks on farm prices are stronger than the effects of monetary policy shocks on exchange rates. Third, farm price dynamics under monetary policy shocks show “delayed overshooting” as exchange rate dynamics do.

TI  - Macroeconomic Effects of Mobile Money in Uganda

A3  - Mawejje, Joseph

AB  - This paper examines the effects of mobile money, a rather new innovation in Uganda’s financial sector landscape on aggregate economic activity and other macroeconomic variables. We first estimate the long-run effect of mobile money deposits and value of transactions on monetary aggregates using vector error correction (VEC) techniques. We then estimate the short-term effects of mobile money on selected macroeconomic variables using Structural Vector Autoregressive (SVAR) methods. Results show modest macroeconomic impacts: mobile money has moderate positive effects on monetary aggregates, the consumer price index, and private sector credit. Mobile money deposits do respond to changes in monetary policy instruments, signalling possible ameliorating effects for the conduct of monetary policy. These results provide evidence for policy makers to continue supporting the growth of mobile money platforms. In particular, policy makers should provide the policy and regulatory framework through which mobile money balances can become interest-bearing assets, as this will further strengthen the monetary policy transmission mechanism

T2  - Japan and the World Economy
AB  - Based on 30 years of experience, I try to explain why the Bank of Japan was more pessimistic in October 2001 as compared to April 2001. This change should be attributed to a slow down in the overseas economy and the price pressure it brings on Japanese economy. In response the Bank changed the main operating target from overnight call rates to the outstanding balance of current accounts. It committed to this policy till prices stopped deflating. This, it was hoped, would discourage banks from holding excess liquidity, but such a change has not occurred. The Bank committed to increase its purchase of long-term government bonds. With the decline in the role of banks in financial intermediation, financial markets become more important, but the stock prices are not responding to monetary relaxation.

TI  - Uncovering Heterogeneous Regional Impacts of Chinese Monetary Policy
AU  - Tsang, Andrew
AB  - This paper applies causal machine learning methods to analyze the heterogeneous regional impacts of monetary policy in China. The method uncovers the heterogeneous regional im-pacts of different monetary policy stances on the provincial figures for real GDP growth, CPI inflation and loan growth compared to the national averages. The varying effects of expansionary and contractionary monetary policy phases on Chinese provinces are highlighted and explained. Subsequently, applying interpretable machine learning, the empirical results show that the credit channel is the main channel affecting the regional impacts of monetary policy. An imminent conclusion of the uneven provincial responses to the “one size fits all” monetary policy is that different policymakers should coordinate their efforts to search for the optimal fiscal and monetary policy mix.

AB  - We identify the international credit channel by exploiting Mexican supervisory data sets and foreign monetary policy shocks in a country with a large presence of European and U.S. banks. A softening of foreign monetary policy expands credit supply of foreign banks (e.g., U.K. policy affects credit supply in Mexico via U.K. banks), inducing strong firm-level real effects. Results support an international risk-taking channel and spillovers of core countries’ monetary policies to emerging markets, both in the foreign monetary softening part (with higher credit and liquidity risk-taking by foreign banks) and in the tightening part (with negative local firm-level real effects).

TI  - US Monetary Policy and Commodities Price Fluctuations
AU  - Siami Namini, Sima
AU  - Hudson, darren
AB  - Commodity price volatility has been a concern for central bank policymakers in the last few years. Commodity prices, especially oil prices, peaked in the aftermath of the financial crisis of 2007, and they have remained relatively volatile since. As they are an important component of a consumer price index (CPI), the driving forces behind them are crucial for the conduct of monetary policy (Svensson, 2005). The aim of this paper is to analyze how a contractionary monetary policy instruments shocks can drive up both the commodity price index and the commodity sub-indices. Using a structural vector auto-regression (SVAR) model, we identify the effect of a positive shock in the short-and long-term interest rates and M2 money stock on the aggregate commodity price index and commodity sub-indices. We provide an impulse response analysis, and evaluate the extent of the role of monetary policy instruments shocks in explaining commodity price fluctuations in aggregate and sub-indices level. The empirical evidence suggests that a U.S. monetary contraction has a negative and significant effect on the aggregate commodity price index and commodity sub-indices, and both reinforce " overshooting hypothesis ". However, the aggregate response masks the existence of significant heterogeneity in the responses of the different types of commodity sub-indices.

AB  - During the Great Recession, the Federal Reserve lowered the federal funds rate nearly to zero and began using unconventional monetary policy. A fed funds rate near zero is no longer a proper representation of policy. Thus, empirical models of monetary policy cannot be estimated as usual. We use a linear empirical model to investigate whether alternative instruments such as the balance sheet or shadow rates can replace the fed funds rate to capture unconventional policy. Our objective is to determine whether adding to or replacing the policy instrument can preserve linearity or whether one must allow structural breaks. We include data for both normal and unconventional periods and find that shadow rates preserve linearity better than using a bounded federal funds rate alone, adding the balance sheet, or adding long rates. When short rates are bounded, shadow rates produce similar responses to the unbounded period and alleviate the need for structural breaks.

TI  - On the Derivation of Monetary Policy Shocks: Should We Throw the VAR out with the Bath Water?
AU  - Brunner, Allan D.
T2  - Journal of Money, Credit and Banking
AB  - This alternative approach to the standard VAR methodology for identifying and estimating the effects of monetary policy shocks makes more reasonable assumptions about economic agents' information set by (1) restructuring the VAR variables according to what data are actually observable at each point in time, and (2) augmenting the VAR model with available measures of market participants' expectations of various economic variables, thus increasing the assumed information set. Should we throw the VAR out with the bath water? Unfortunately, the results of this paper are somewhat inconclusive. The expectations measures prove to be quite valuable-the variances of all innovations are reduced by at least one-half compared to the standard VAR innovations. Nevertheless, the innovations, monetary policy shocks, and impulse responses for both methods are fairly similar. Indeed, they are similar enough that the standard VAR approach cannot be rejected out of hand, but dissimilar enough that the standard approach cannot be validated.

In our economy the foreign country hosts the only active equity market where also residents of the home country can trade stocks of listed foreign firms. We show that, in order to achieve price stability, the Central Banks in both countries should grant a dedicated response to movements in stock prices driven by relative productivity shocks. Determinacy of rational expectations equilibria and approximation of the Wicksellian interest rate policy by simple monetary policy rules are also investigated.

AB  - The main task for the Central Bank is ensuring the stability of the national currency. For this purpose, it tends to use traditional monetary regulation instruments. There are interest rates regulation, currencies intervention, administrative restriction, money supply adjustment and so on. A significant number of these traditional tools are effective. However, it is very difficult to assess the effectiveness of the regulators influence.Therefore, the purpose of the work is to define the theoretical substantiation of the basic monetary regulation instruments effectiveness and estimate its influence on the economy growth indicators in Ukraine.This article is based on the theoretical principles and methods of macroeconomic analysis; the system approach methods to define the main monetary regulation instruments of finance system and economy. The study presents a regression models with paired and multiple variables. For these models R-Studio instruments are the main tools of quality estimation and results interpretation.The article shows the results of statistical analysis of national currency rate and consumer price index which is based on open data of Ukraine economy trends for the period from 2007 till 2019. Traditionally econometric methods are used to find out long run relationships between basic economy indicators (agriculture and industry outputs, average salary, stock index growth etc.) and both monetary information and regulation instruments.Authors develop the regressive models of influence of Central Bank regulation instruments of monetary and economic stability. The paper presents conclusions regarding trends and problems in the implementation of Ukraine’s monetary policy, it’s influences on the currency stability and economic growth trends.Implementation of the proposed measures will increase monetary policy effectiveness and define the directions of the further research in forecasting inflationary and course-forming factors of the development of the national economy and financial system of Ukraine.The key focus of further research is to define an adequate indicator that determines the real level of inflation, which must evaluate a whole range of factors reducing the real value of money.

TI  - Effects of Monetary Policy Shocks on the Exchange Rate in the Republic of Korea: Capital Flows in Stock and Bond Markets
AU  - Kim, Soyoung
T2  - Asian Development Review
AB  - Several studies have suggested that the prediction of standard theory on the effects of monetary policy on the exchange rate might not be applicable to or in the case of the Republic of Korea because participation of foreign investors is weak in the bond market but strong in the stock market. The current study examines the effects of monetary policy shocks on the exchange rate in the Republic of Korea by using structural vector autoregression models with sign restrictions. To determine the channels by which monetary policy shocks affect the exchange rate, I investigate the effects on various components of capital flows. The main empirical findings are as follows. First, a contractionary monetary policy shock, which increases the interest rate, appreciates the Korean won significantly in the short run as predicted by most theories. Second, contractionary monetary policy shocks increase capital inflows into the bond market consistent with the prediction of the uncovered interest parity condition. This seems to be the main channel by which contractionary monetary shocks appreciate the won. Finally, foreign investors tend to withdraw money from the domestic stock market in response to a monetary tightening, resulting in a decrease in capital inflows.

AB  - As the Federal Reserve has become more transparent about its decisions on the federal funds target rate, the general public has begun to regard the rate as not only a benchmark interest rate, but also as a signal about the state of the economy. However, the specific information considered by the public to be revealed is not clearly understood. We investigate this question and find that the information revealed by monetary policy decisions is regarding future output growth, not inflation, and that such an information effect is theoretically optimal and does not make interest-rate policies self-defeating.

In contrast to large parts of the literature, pegging the exchange rate is never the best policy choice for the small open economy in our model. Instead, monetary targeting and, depending on the parameter combination, producer price index targeting come closest to the optimal policy rule in terms of welfare. Generally, the welfare performance of the simple targeting rules under consideration hinge critically on the degree of pass-through in the home economy and in the rest of the world.

TI  - Does the bank credit channel of monetary policy matter in the Philippines?
AU  - Bayangos, Veronica
AB  - This paper addresses the bank credit channel of monetary policy in the Philippines by adding and re-specifying a dynamic, structural, economy-wide macro econometric model. The main question is whether the credit channel matters in transmitting impulses to the real economy in the Philippines. The evidence on the bank credit channel is obtained by estimating changes in bank credit that take into account not only the monetary policy indicators, but specific banking indicators to monetary policy actions, such as bank capital. Simulation results suggest that bank credit channel matters in Philippine monetary transmission mechanism. The total demand impact of changes in bank credit is the sum of various effects in the money supply, Treasury bill and lending rates, personal consumption and investment, all of which have significant impact on aggregate demand. However, the impact of a monetary policy tightening on output appears to be relatively moderate and quite long. Meanwhile, the impact on the price level appears to be stronger and shorter compared to the impact on output. In addition, bank capital is found to have significant effects on bank credit, implying that it could potentially be a key determinant of monetary policy transmission. The preliminary results also indicate a feedback loop from real output to bank credit through the financial accelerator and wealth effects.

We find that monetary policy tightening leads to a persistent decrease in regional real personal income and employment, with asymmetric effects across regions that are magnified by spatial spillovers. The magnitude of the effects depends on the period under analysis and on the direction of the monetary policy shock. We also provide evidence of the existence of the interest rate and the housing market channels, although there is weak support for the presence of the credit channels at the regional level.

AB  - What caused the housing boom of the 2000s? A number of researchers have suggested that loose monetary policy during the first half of the 2000s was a primary cause of the substantial run-up in house prices in many countries. However, using a common statistical approach, we find that monetary policy was not the main factor. That should not be surprising: Although low interest rates raise house prices, the increase in prices during the mid-2000s was much larger than the historical relationship between the two variables would suggest. Instead, we investigate further the link between the marked loosening in terms and standards for mortgage credit and the most rapid increases in house prices. This link provides some evidence for a story where credit provision and the demand for housing fed on each other and helped spur the housing boom. Our work suggests a greater role for macroprudential regulation rather than monetary policy in managing asset price booms.— Jane Dokko, Brian M. Doyle, Michael T.

TI  - Exchange Rate Dynamics and Monetary Policy in a Small Open Economy: A DSGE Model
AU  - Ouchen, Mariam
AU  - Ziky, Mustapha
AB  - This paper compares alternative monetary policy rules in a small open economy that experiences internal shocks (productivity shocks) and external shocks to terms of trade and the foreign demand. A comparison of the volatility of the macroeconomic variables such as inflation, output, terms of trade, trade balance, investment and exchange rates under the different monetary rules is set to lead to the choice of the optimal exchange rate regime. I will show that these regimes can be ranked in terms of their implied volatility for the considered macroeconomic variables.  A two-country version of the Calvo sticky price model is used to analyze the macroeconomic implications of four alternative monetary policy regimes for a small open economy: domestic inflation targeting, managed float, CPI targeting and an exchange rate peg. The degree of exchange rate pass-through is very important for the assessment of monetary rules. I find that the CPI targeting rule is the best policy in an economy that exhibits lagged exchange rate pass-through. With low pass-through, both the domestic and the overall prices respond sluggishly to shocks, and it is more efficient for the monetary authority to target the overall CPI rather than just domestic prices. In a low pass-through environment, the policy maker can simultaneously strictly target (CPI) inflation, but still allow high volatility in the nominal exchange rate to stabilize the real economy in face of shocks. The low rate of pass-through ensures that exchange rate shocks do not destabilize the price level. An important feature of low pass-through is that it eliminates the trade-off between output volatility and inflation volatility in the comparison of fixed relative to floating exchange rates.

T2  - Journal of Policy Modeling
AB  - In the backdrop of adoption of inflation targeting framework, this paper computes optimal monetary policy rules for India conditional upon a small model of the economy covering the period 2000–2014. Weights to policy rules are developed by minimizing alterative inter-temporal loss functions defined over the variance of inflation, output and policy instrument from their respective targets. An optimal policy rule with the ratio of weight on output gap to inflation gap higher than in the standard Taylor rule and a flexible inflation targeting framework turns out to be welfare maximising for India. Lower interest rate smoothing or quicker monetary policy responses than estimated from the past data may be warranted to increase society’s welfare. While a policy rate in the range of 6.25–6.70 appears to be best suited under the macroeconomic situation prevailing during 2015–16, rates lower than 6.25% would lie outside the policy efficiency frontier.

TI  - Effects of Monetary Policy on Food Inequality in India
AU  - De, Kuhelika

T2  - The Journal of Development Studies
AB  - Food insecurity and hunger are significant components of standard poverty measures and continue to be pressing issues in emerging market economies. However, these issues have received less attention in examining the indirect effects of monetary policy. In this paper, we study the impact of monetary policy on food inequality in India. Specifically, we examine the impact of monetary policy shocks on relative food prices and the distribution of food consumption, focusing on subsistence food consumption of poor households. Using the most recent household survey data, we estimate the dynamic effects of monetary policy shocks on relative food prices and the distribution of food consumption in rural and urban India using a dynamic common factor model. Our results show that expansionary monetary policy shocks increase the relative price of food, reduce the food consumption of poor households, and raise food consumption inequality across households. Increase in the relative price of food following a monetary expansion disproportionately hurts the poor relative to the non-poor. This is the first study to provide evidence of a ‘food price channel’ in monetary policy transmission to understand food inequality. This study holds important policy implications for Indian central bankers and policymakers as well as for those in similar emerging market economies.

This paper studies the international transmission of the euro area´s monetary policy and financial stress to Russia. The results show that financial stress in the euro area damages Russian economic activity and stock prices, but not its trade balance. The contractionary euro area monetary policy shock decreases Russian GDP, leads to real appreciation of the euro against the Russian rouble, damages Russian stock prices, but does not significantly affect the trade balance between countries. We also found that the Central Bank of the Russian Federation adjusts to monetary policy shocks in the euro area.

T2  - Review of Development Finance
AB  - This study investigates whether remittances entail extra risk for macroeconomic policy management and examines the role (if any) that the financial system can play in the interaction between remittances and monetary policy. Employing panel data for 106 developing countries from 1970 to 2013, the results from our panel vector auto-regressive (PVAR) model reveal that remittance volatility reduces macroeconomic risk in developing countries while simultaneously stimulating a reduction in domestic interest rates. This finding remains robust to alternative specifications of remittance volatility and monetary policy risk and to variations in the degree of financial development. The key lesson from this study is that developing countries can leverage the positive impact of remittances in reducing macroeconomic instability by implementing policies that induce remittances.

AB  - By testing the impact of monetary policy on the bond market and the impact of the bond market on the real macro economy using different empirical methods, this article examines the performance of the bond price transmission mechanism in China’s monetary policy. Empirical studies show that monetary policy has power over bond yield fluctuations, while the bond market has a relatively limited impact on the real macro economy. Short-term bond yields have relatively significant transmission effects on some output variables, such as consumption, investment, and the consumer price index, while the influence of long-term bonds is not significant.

AB  - This paper aimed to investigate the evidence on the transmission of China’s monetary policy shocks to macroeconomic variables in Iran. Since 1990, China has become one of the main trading partners of Iran; therefore, it is expected that China’s macroeconomic shocks have some consequences on Iran’s Economy. In this study, a structural vector autoregressive model is used to explore such a transmission. The findings of the study reveal that the China’s monetary policy changes significantly affect the Consumer Price Index (CPI) as Iran’s CPI meaningfully increases with the expansion of China’s money supply. Furthermore, it was found that Iran’s other economic variables, including the real GDP, real effective exchange rate, and interest rate, do not significantly reflect the China’s monetary shocks; even though confirm the expected sign and direction.

AU  - Canzoneri, Matthew B.
AU  - Henderson, Dale W.
AB  - Monetary Policy in Interdependent Economies provides the first comprehensive overview of the implications of using game theory to analyze interactions among national monetary policymakers. It synthesizes the pessimistic view of sovereign policymaking that results from the analysis of one-shot games with the optimistic view derived from the analysis of quid pro quo strategies in repeated games. Good outcomes, the authors conclude, require coordination among noncooperative policymakers, and that sometimes policymakers, must be forced to cooperate. They suggest two roles for supranational institutions such as the International Monetary Fund: the IMF can provide a forum where noncooperative policymakers, can work to achieve good outcomes, and it can police agreements among cooperative policymakers Canzoneri and Henderson take clear stands on controversial issues and make recent advances in game theory accessible by using a single unified framework to explain a wide range of concepts. They begin by analyzing one-shot interactions between two policymakers, In subsequent chapters they extend their analysis to allow for more policymakers, and coalitions, for repeated interactions among policymakers, and for the possibility of time inconsistency. Matthew B. Canzoneri is Professor of Economics at Georgetown University. Dale W. Henderson is Assistant Director, Division of International Finance, Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.

TI  - An analysis of the effectiveness of inflation targeting monetary policy framework in South Africa
AU  - Makuvaza, Leonard
AB  - The aim of this study was to investigate the effectiveness of inflation targeting in South Africa using the Vector Autoregressive method (VAR). The study used monthly data for the period 2000 to 2013 on the following variables: Consumer Price Index Inflation (CPI), money supply (M1), Repo Rate and the Nominal Exchange Rate (NER). The VAR methodology was used to investigate the response of inflation to monetary policy shocks under the inflation targeting framework. The findings from the study revealed that the response of inflation is not consistent with the Taylor rule hence increases in the repo rate meant to reduce inflation actually increase the inflationary pressures in the economy. This is due to the composition of the Consumer Price Index. Housing constitutes the largest weight on the CPI hence this has an impact on how the Repo rate affects inflation. Increases in the repo rate results in increase in the demand for rentals because prospective home owners tend to resort to renting because mortgage loans become expensive as a result of high interest rates. The increase in the demand for rentals pushes the rental price of houses. This results in higher inflation levels. Furthermore, the study established that the inflation targeting framework is effective in reducing inflation persistence because inflation approaches steady state with twelve months after exposure to structural shocks in the VAR system. The autoregression model of inflation showed that the sum of the coefficients is less than one (0.965) showing that inflation targeting has effectively reduced the persistence of inflation of South Africa.

AB  - Existing research shows that the monetary policy uncertainty of developed countries has spillover effects. China and India are the world's major populous countries and developing economies. Does China's monetary policy uncertainty have spillover effects on India's macro economy? This paper uses the TVP-VAR model to empirically study the impact of Chinese MPU on India's index of industrial production, consumer price index and stock price volatility. The results show that: Chinese MPU has significant non-linear time-varying spillover on India's three variables; The impact of CPI and CPI mainly exists in the short-term, with almost no impact in the medium and long-term, and has an impact on the volatility of the stock market in the short, medium and long-term. In most cases, the Chinese MPU has suppressed the domestic IIP in India, which has promoted inflation and aggravated the Indian stock market.

AB  - This study has analyzed the monetary policy reaction function of Pakistan's economy. To attain the objective of the estimation of the Taylor rule, we have used quarterly data from 2005q1-2020q3.Static and dynamic rules for the closed and open economy are estimated to investigate the monetary policy reaction function. For this purpose, we have used the OLS technique. We also have investigated the issue of non-linearity of the monetary policy reaction function in terms of the output gap and inflation rate, assuming asymmetric monetary authority preferences. The monetary policy tool has a lot of inertia and the exchange rate highlights fluctuation in interest rate. The State bank of Pakistan does not consider the nominal exchange rate in its monetary policy. In the first rule, we find the consumer price index appears to be significantly positive with average treasury bills and average call money rate but insignificant with an average coupon rate. In the second rule, we find the nominal effective exchange rate insignificant to the average Treasury bill, average coupon rate and average call money rate which shows that the state bank of Pakistan does not consider the nominal exchange rate in its monetary policy. In the third Rule, we find the lag of the average Treasury bill which appears positive and significant with all variables which reflects that the lag of the average Treasury bill has a more powerful impact than other variables to estimate the monetary in Pakistan.

TI  - Recent unorthodox monetary policies vs. orthodox theory of monetary policy: comments and views on Jordan
AU  - Hayashi, Naotsugu
T2  - International Journal of Economic Policy Studies
AB  - This article investigates and examines theoretically and empirically the mechanisms and effects of so-called non-traditional or unorthodox monetary policies, such as quantitative monetary easing, zero interest rate policy (ZIR), and negative interest rate policy (NIR), implemented in response to the recent deflationary recession, and especially after the global financial crisis (GFC) in Japan and the United States, in discussing Jordan (Issues and challenges of monetary and fiscal policies caused by quantity easing by Central Banks, 2018), (Int J Econ Policy Stud 13, 2019). According to Friedman and Schwartz’s (Monetary history of the United States, 1867–1960, 1963) original definition, high-powered money (HPM), or monetary base (MB), comprises cash currency (CC) plus required reserves (RR) that can have the power of credit creation. However, the current Federal Reserve System (Fed) and the Bank of Japan (BOJ) have added interest-paid excess reserves (ER), which have no power of credit creation, to MB. Therefore, since ER which paid interest from October 2008 sharply increased, and as a result, MB (which includes ER) increased sharply, the Fed and the BOJ mistook this as bold quantitative monetary easing, and were overconfident of being able to easily achieve the 2% inflation target, although CC and RR increased only slightly. However, in fact, neither the 2% inflation target nor an increase in the real economic growth rate were achieved. This paper examines theoretically and empirically why they failed to achieve the 2% inflation target, and why they failed to raise the real growth rate, in spite of bold monetary easing, flexible fiscal policy, and growth strategies. We conclude that, to achieve stable growth, an appropriate, rule-based, stable monetary policy is necessary.

T2  - Applied Economics
AB  - The traditional Vector Autoregression (VAR) method is widely used to trace out the effects of monetary policy innovations on the economy. However, this method suffers from the curse of dimensionality, so that in practice VARs are estimated on a limited number of variables, leading to a potential missing information problem. In this article we use the method of structural factor analysis to evaluate the effects of monetary policy on key macroeconomic variables in a data rich environment. This methodology allows us to extract information on monetary policy and its impact on the economy from a much larger data set than is possible with the traditional VAR method. We propose two structural factor models. One is the Structural Factor Augmented Vector Autoregressive (SFAVAR) model and the other is the Structural Factor Vector Autoregressive (SFVAR) model. Compared to the traditional VAR, both models incorporate information from hundreds of data series, series that can be and are monitored by the central bank in setting policy. Moreover, the factors used are structurally meaningful, a feature that adds to the understanding of the ‘black box’ of the monetary transmission mechanism. Both models generate qualitatively reasonable impulse response functions. For the SFVAR model, both the price puzzle and the liquidity puzzle are eliminated.

Econ. 113 (1998) 869–902]. This approach identifies the exogenous components of monetary policy by establishing equilibrium models of the reserve market. In this paper, two equilibrium models are presented: the Implicit Cost (IC) model and the Credit Rationing (CR) model. These particular models are distinguished by opposing views about the BOJ's discount-window borrowing policy. The IC model is characterized by the assumption that the BOJ endogenously accommodates the demand for discount-window borrowing by private banks, whereas the CR model assumes that the BOJ exogenously controls the level of discount-window lending. The results indicate that the CR model is superior to the IC model in describing the operating procedures used by the BOJ up to June 1995. J. Japanese Int. Economies 20 (3) (2006) 406–433.

TI  - INFLATION TARGETING, EXCHANGE RATE PASS-THROUGH, AND MONETARY POLICY RULE IN INDONESIA
AU  - Kuncoro, Haryo
AB  - The purpose of this paper is twofold: (1) to investigate whether the degree of exchange rate pass-through (ERPT) becomes lower in the inflation targeting (IT) frameworks and (2) to identify whether the ERPT is reflected in the monetary policy reaction function. To test those hypotheses, we use monthly data in the case of Indonesia over the period 2003(1)-2013(12). By applying ARDL model, the results prove the complete ERPT exists only for import and producer prices. The ERPT tends to remain unchanged both in the pre- and post-IT periods. We also find that the exchange rate fluctuations fail to explain the interest rate policy. Given those results, we conclude that IT in Indonesia puts too much emphasize on stabilizing the domestic currency mainly based on the consumer price index. She loses ERPT import and producer price indices thus leading to benign neglect of stabilizing its external value in term of exchange rate. Furthermore, to achieve simultaneously both the domestic and external price shocks stabilization, the central bank credibility plays an important role in conducting IT policy which operates primarily through a signaling effect.

T2  - International Review of Economics & Finance
AB  - Whose confidence matters in Chinese monetary policy—consumers or entrepreneurs? To answer this question, we first conduct a competition test between the two groups and find that the entrepreneurs' confidence plays a much more dominant role than the consumer confidence in the transmission process of monetary policy. In addition, we use counterfactual structural vector autoregression method to isolate and identify the effect of confidence. The empirical results show that the effectiveness of proactive monetary policy will be strikingly reduced if the channel of entrepreneurs’ confidence is shut down. Removing the effect of consumer confidence from the system, however, produces little impact on the effectiveness of monetary. These findings are robust to both price-based and quantitative-based policy variables in China.

T2  - China & World Economy
AB  - The present paper examines the role of the mix of fiscal and monetary policy rules in determining inflation dynamics using fiscal and monetary policy reaction functions and Markov-switching vector autoregression methods based on quarterly data in the period 1992–2007. Our results show that fiscal and monetary policies in China can be adequately described using some simple rules, and that significant regime shifts took place around 1998. Fiscal policy tended to be active and countercyclical in the pre-1998 period, then switched to be passive and more countercyclical, whereas monetary policy was characterized as passive and procyclical in the pre-1998 period, and switched to be active and countercyclical afterwards. The mix of fiscal and monetary policy rules can explain inflation dynamics better than the monetary policy rule alone. Therefore, price stability requires not only appropriate monetary policy but also appropriate fiscal policy.

AB  - The main problem that needs to be addressed in depth with regard to monetary policy is whether its process has a positive relationship to the economy. This study is intended to investigate monetary policy transmission mechanism for financing line in a dual monetary system in Indonesia. The results of the Granger Causality test revealed that the relationship pattern within variables in the monetary policy transmission mechanism for financing line cannot be clearly identified. In addition, the Impulse response function test proved that the Consumer Price Index (CPI) responds to other shocks. As a whole, CPI responds positively to the shock of Bank Indonesia Sharia Certificate, Islamic interbank money market, and financing. On the contrary, Consumer price index responds negatively to the shock of Third Party Funds and Bank Indonesia sharia deposit facility. Meanwhile, the Variance Decomposition test proved that Islamic Banking Financing contributes to the final goal of the policy. Yet, its contribution is relatively small, which is 0.04%.

TI  - Monetary Policy Transmission in Emerging Asia: The Role of Banks and the Effects of Financial Globalization
AU  - Ananchotikul, Nasha

AB  - Given the heavy reliance on bank lending as the main source of financing in most Asian economies, banks could potentially play a pivotal role in monetary policy transmission. However, we find that Asia’s bank lending channel or, more broadly, credit channel of domestic monetary policy is not very strong at the aggregate level. Using bank-level data for nine Asian economies during 2000–2013, we show that heterogeneity of bank characteristics (e.g., ownership type, financial position), degree of foreign bank penetration of the domestic banking sector, and global financial conditions all have a bearing on the response of domestic credit to changes in domestic monetary policy, and may account for the apparently weak credit channel at aggregate level.

AB  - We identify the effects of monetary policy on credit risk-taking with an exhaustive credit register of loan applications and contracts. We separate the changes in the composition of the supply of credit from the concurrent changes in the volume of supply and quality, and the volume of demand. We employ a two-stage model that analyzes the granting of loan applications in the first stage and loan outcomes for the applications granted in the second stage, and that controls for both observed and unobserved, time-varying, firm and bank heterogeneity through time*firm and time*bank fixed effects. We find that a lower overnight interest rate induces lowly capitalized banks to grant more loan applications to ex ante risky firms and to commit larger loan volumes with fewer collateral requirements to these firms, yet with a higher ex post likelihood of default. A lower long-term interest rate and other relevant macroeconomic variables have no such effects.

AU  - Junicke, Monika
T2  - Macroeconomic Dynamics
AB  - I use a two-country dynamic stochastic general equilibrium (DSGE) model with a nonzero steady-state inflation to study monetary policy in transition economies. In particular, my analysis focuses on whether inflation targeting is based on a consumer price index (CPI) or its producer counterpart, producer price index (PPI). This issue is specifically relevant for transition economies as they might be subject to Balassa–Samuelson effects arising from trading in international markets. Under these circumstances, domestic inflation is possibly higher than imported inflation, hence targeting PPI inflation may prove more effective in influencing domestic macroeconomic variables than targeting CPI inflation. Using a Bayesian methodology, I find that the central banks of three Eastern European countries (namely, the Czech Republic, Hungary, and Poland) are likely to target PPI inflation rather than CPI inflation. This result is in line with the theoretical predictions in the literature, and is robust across several Taylor-type rules.

AB  - This article sets out a simple New Keynesian open‐economy model and shows that the conduct of discretionary monetary policy in an open economy differs substantially from the closed‐economy framework. The article shows analytically that the existence of the direct exchange rate channel in the open economy Phillips Curve impairs the perfect stabilising property of monetary policy in the face of demand‐side disturbances under domestic inflation targeting. If CPI inflation is instead the target, then the perfect stabilising property of monetary policy breaks down even in the absence of the direct exchange rate channel in the Phillips Curve.

TI  - The Consumer Price Index as a Measure of Inflation
AU  - Bryan, Michael F.
AU  - Cecchetti, Stephen G.
AB  - As inflation approaches zero, it becomes increasingly important to examine the price indices on which monetary policy is based. The most popularly used aggregate price statistic in the U.S. is the Consumer Price Index (CPI), a statistic that appears to be a focal point in monetary policy deliberations. A problem associated with using the CPI, a fixed weight index of the cost-of-living, is that there are likely to be biases in the index as a measure of inflation. In this paper we use a simple statistical framework to compute a price index that is immune to one of the potentially important biases inherent in the CPI as a measure of inflation–weighting bias. Utilizing a dynamic factor model we are able to compute the common inflation element in a broad cross-section of consumer price changes. Our conclusion is that, although there was a large positive weighting bias during the fifteen years beginning in 1967, since 1981 the weighting bias in the CPI as a measure of inflation has been insignificant.

T2  - Labor History
AB  - Employing two widely used approaches to identify the effects of monetary policy, this paper explores the differential impact of policy on the labor market outcomes of teenagers, minorities, out-of-school youth, and less-skilled individuals. Evidence from recursive vector autoregressions and autoregressive distributed lag models that use information on the Federal Reserve's contractionary initiatives indicate that the employment–population ratio of minorities is more sensitive to contractionary monetary policy than that of whites; the ratio falls primarily because of an increase in unemployment and not because of a decline in labor force participation. Monetary policy appears to have a disproportionate effect on the unemployment rate of teenagers, particularly African American teenagers. Their employment–population ratio falls because of increased difficulty in obtaining employment. The larger responses are not caused by their higher likelihood of having been employed in industries and occupations that are more sensitive to contractionary monetary policy.

We find that contractionary monetary policy reduces growth rate of real house price more strongly when the market is characterized by optimism rather than pessimism, with this effect being more pronounced under unconventional monetary policy decisions. Further robustness checks confirm our results. Our findings highlight the role in sentiments in driving the policy effectiveness and thus, have important implications for policy decisions.

AU  - Zhou, Xuan
T2  - Journal of Risk and Financial Management
AB  - Interaction of fiscal and monetary policy is crucial for macroeconomic stability, especially for an economy with downward pressure as well as a tightened space for macro policy, like China. In this paper, we use a time-varying-parameter (TVP-VAR) model to study Chinese fiscal–monetary interaction and divide it into three periods. We claim that China went through a monetary dominant regime from 1996Q to 2017Q4 since the response of CPI to a fiscal expansion was negative in the short run and about zero in the long run, while the monetary expansion had positive effects on CPI. During this period, the response of government spending and money supply to each other’s shock had the same sign, indicating that the two policies acted as complements. However, we argue that 2008Q4 was a turning point that divided this period into two different periods. The response level of M2 growth rate to a fiscal expansion kept rising from 1996Q1 to 2008Q4, indicating the central bank’s increasingly active cooperation with fiscal policy, while it decreased from 2009Q1 to 2017Q4. Since 2018Q1, the economy has been going through a fiscal dominant regime in that the response of GDP growth rate and CPI to the fiscal expansion has sharply increased. We also argue that the relative change of the role between the two policies should be mainly attributed to the variation in the fiscal authority’s characteristics because fiscal response to a monetary shock has remained at a similar level the whole time, even if there have been changes in the characteristics of the central bank.

T2  - CBN Journal of Applied Statistics
AB  - This paper investigates the effectiveness of monetary-fiscal policies interaction on price and output growth in Nigeria. The dynamic correlations of variables have been captured by the analyses of impulse response and variance decomposition. From innovation analyses, the results suggest that the policy variables money supply and government revenue have more positive impact on price and economic growth in Nigeria specifically in the long run, thus some time with lag. Although monetary and fiscal policy variables have a dominant effect on economic activity, it is clear from this study that economic activity is dominated by its own dynamics in most of the periods. The estimates presented in this paper suggest that both monetary and fiscal policy exert greater impact on real GDP and inflation in Nigeria. Overall, it is evident that the impact of policy is sorely depending on the policy variable selected, although some policy variables are considered to be more beneficial to the social and economic development.

AB  - This study investigates whether remittances entail extra risk for macroeconomic policy management and examines the role (if any) that the financial system can play in the interaction between remittances and monetary policy. Employing panel data for 106 developing countries from 1970 to 2013, the results from our panel vector auto-regressive (PVAR) model reveal that remittance volatility reduces macroeconomic risk in developing countries while simultaneously stimulating a reduction in domestic interest rates. This finding remains robust to alternative specifications of remittance volatility and monetary policy risk and to variations in the degree of financial development. The key lesson from this study is that developing countries can leverage the positive impact of remittances in reducing macroeconomic instability by implementing policies that induce remittances.

AB  - A number of central bankers and their economic advisors consider that monetary policy played little or no role in the run-up to the crisis. On this view, the financial upheaval was mainly the result of an external macroeconomic shock, made worse by the imprudent behaviour of some financial institutions. Their argument can be summarised as follows:Inflation (CPI) has been low and stable in recent years, showing that the fundamental objective of monetary policy (price stability) has been achieved;The financial crisis was basically the result of “excess savings” and the balance-ofpayment surpluses of major emerging economies. This caused the surge in housing and other asset prices, and enabled the US current-account deficit to be financed. The excess liquidity created by these imbalances was not caused by monetary policy;Another factor that explains the crisis is the behaviour of a number of financial institutions (in particular “non banks”, hedge funds and investment banks) that went too far in leveraging their capital.

AB  - This paper investigates the empirical relationship between the monetary stance and stock market performance of Bangladesh using monthly data from January 2001 to December 2013. The empirical investigation was conducted using autoregressive distributed lag (ARDL) model consisting of five alternative measures of monetary indicators - 91 day T-bill rate, reserve money, broad money, call money rate and weighted average deposit rate and DSE General Index (DGEN) for stock market performance. In the case of using 91 day Treasury bill (T-bill) or call money rate as monetary indicators, a long-run co-integration relationship between DGEN, T-bill rate, CPI and exchange rate is found. However, in the case of broad money, reserve money and weighted average deposit rate, no long-run co-integration is found. Overall, this paper suggests that stock market valuation level is affected by monetary conditions.

AU  - Sutherland, Alan
T2  - Journal of Economic Dynamics and Control
AB  - This paper analyses the implications of the ‘expenditure switching effect’ for the role of the exchange rate in monetary policy in a small open economy. It is shown that, when the elasticity of substitution between home and foreign goods is not equal to unity, welfare depends on the variances of producer prices and the terms of trade. Producer-price targeting is compared to consumer-price targeting and a fixed exchange rate. It is found that a fixed exchange rate yields higher welfare than the other regimes only when the elasticity of substitution between home and foreign goods is very high.

This paper examines how a multistage production process that involves more than one country affects the transmission of monetary policy changes. We assume that imported and domestic inputs are required to produce final consumption goods. Monetary policy may have adverse beggar-thyself effects if the mutual dependence between countries is considerably high. The foreign country benefits from a home monetary expansion unless the competitiveness of markets is too low.

T2  - Global Disclosure of Economics and Business
AB  - The objective of this paper is to analyze and discuss the impacts of monetary policy on Bangladesh inflation, identify the major drawbacks of the policies in minimizing the inflation rate and suggest policy recommendations on some key issues of Bangladesh inflation. To estimate the effects of the monetary policy in Bangladesh, at first the impact of different monetary policy tools used by the “Central Banks” of the developed countries have been reviewed. Next, the impact of the monetary policy of Bangladesh Bank and government have been analyzed for which the data on money supply, growth of the GDP, changes in the price level, and changes in the unemployment rate have been quantitatively analyzed. We mainly used Consumer Price Index to determine the level on inflation in Bangladesh. Moreover, our study focuses on data collected from the 1950-2012, mainly focusing our study from the period of 2000-2012 as major transitions have been observed in the economy during the 12 years. We have further analyzed whether there is any correlation between (i) inflation rates and money supply, and (ii) inflation rates and growth of GDP. On the basis of the outcome of the qualitative and quantitative analysis, in the end findings and conclusion have been drawn. We have found the correlation, the impacts of monetary policy and inflation, their drawbacks and possible solutions such as independence of the monetary policy from the fiscal policy and enhancing the transparency, communication and signaling effect of policy moves, keeping the broad money in line with the estimated real GDP growth, borrowing from non-bank sources, and control money supply through various open market operations. Due to lack of access to sufficient data, some of our work is based on hypothesis and models. So some data vary according to the model being used. Lastly, even though, many works have been done from the perspective of developed and other developing countries, much work has not been carried out to establish the relationship between monetary policy and inflation in Bangladesh.

T2  - Australian Economic Review
AB  - This study examines the role of monetary policy shocks on food inflation in India, spanning from January 2009 to December 2019. Utilising quantile regression analysis, we find that contractionary monetary policy stabilises food inflation across the quantiles. However, exchange rate and transportation cost play a substantial role in promoting food inflation in lower, middle and all quantiles. Our study also reveals that monetary policy transmission through exchange rate and asset price channels increases food inflation across all quantiles. In contrast, bank credit and interest rate channels reduce it in lower and median quantiles, that is, at lower rates of inflation.

AB  - In this paper, China’s core inflation is defined as any price changes that are caused by the money supply. This definition is especially relevant to examining monetary policy because the money supply is controllable by China’s central bank. This paper develops a New Keynesian DSGE model with a quantity-based monetary rule that fits real aggregated data from China to analyze core inflation’s key characteristics. Eight different approaches are used to estimate core inflation in China. By constructing VAR models of output growth, money supply growth and core inflation, we estimate the response of core inflation measures to the money supply shock. By matching the response to money supply shocks in both the model and the data, we compare the performance of different core inflation measures for monetary policy in China.

T2  - International Journal of Economics, Finance and Management Sciences
AB  - The need to determine the factors that promote investment decisions in agriculture both on the part of the government and the citizenry in order to put the economy on the part of sustainable growth and development prompted this study. The broad objective of the study is to analyze the effectiveness of government annual budgetary allocation to agriculture and the role of monetary policy instruments in the growth of agricultural GDP. Data were sourced from the CBN statistical bulletin (various issues), and the National Bureau of Statistics. The data covers 1980-2012 and the method of analysis used is the OLS using E-view. The result of the analysis showed that Agricultural Credit Guarantee Scheme Fund, previous year GDPand Consumer Price Index contribute positively to the growth of agricultural GDP, other variables of interest like the interest rate, exchange rate, and government expenditure on agriculture contributed negatively to agricultural GDP growth. The study therefore recommended that government should increase her spending to agricultural sector, monitor the fund allocated, and provide the necessary infrastructural facilities like good road network, electricity health and water for the rural populace. The study concluded by recommending that the CBN should encourage the investor to invest in agriculture by bringing the interest rate down to single digit in order to facilitate investment in agriculture and promote consistent growth of agricultural GDP.

TI  - Monetary Policy and the Uncovered Interest Rate Parity Puzzle: Theory and Empirical Results for Oceania
AU  - Guender, Alfred V.
T2  - Economic Record
AB  - This article offers a theory-based explanation for why high- interest-rate countries see their currencies appreciate, the so-called UIP puzzle. The central bank bases its target rule on the lag of the policy instrument and the CPI inflation rate. When combined with a stylised model of an open economy, the endogenous target rule can account for the systematic negative relation between the change in the exchange rate and the lagged interest rate differential. Foreign inflation and the foreign interest rate also affect nominal exchange rate changes. The model-based behaviour of the exchange rate is tested on New Zealand and Australian data with mixed results.

TI  - The Impact of Interest Rate Channel of Monetary Policy on Output and Prices in Nigeria: An Unrestricted VAR Approach
AU  - Onanuga, Abayomi

AB  - This paper uses the vector auto-regression analytical method to examine the interest rate channel of 
monetary policy and to compare the period after the Structural Adjustment Period (1986Q1-1999Q1) with
the period of the civilian administration (1999Q2-2012Q4) in Nigeria. The results of the second period 
indicated that monetary tightening leads first to an immediate fall in real output in the first 3 months 
reaching a maximum decline in 9 months. The first period indicated that real output start to decline after 6 
months reaching a maximum decline in 12months. In response to monetary policy, for the second period, 
domestic prices did not start to decline until after 6months and it never returns to equilibrium. The 
findings for the first period indicate that prices started to rise after 4months and reach its peak in 12 
months after the shock. We found evidence of interest channel in the two periods but monetary policy is 
more effective in the latter period compared to the earlier period.

TI  - Monetary policy and welfare in a small open economy
AU  - De Paoli, Bianca
AB  - This paper characterizes welfare in a small open economy and derives the corresponding optimal monetary policy rule. It shows that the utility-based loss function for a small open economy is a quadratic expression in domestic inflation, output gap and real exchange rate. In contrast to previous works, this paper demonstrates that welfare in a small open economy, completely integrated with the rest of the world, is affected by exchange rate variability. Consequently, the optimal policy in a small open economy is not isomorphic to a closed economy and does not prescribe a pure floating exchange rate regime. Domestic inflation targeting is optimal only under a particular parameterization, where the unique relevant distortion in the economy is price stickiness. Under a general specification for preferences and in the presence of inefficient steady state output, exchange rate targeting arises as part of the optimal monetary plan.

AB  - We review the experience of central banks in 12 advanced economies in formulating their price stability objectives during the last 20 years. All central banks under review target a small and positive inflation rate (typically 2%). In most cases, they set a point target, in some a range or a point with bands around it. Range and bands are more common among small open economies. We also conduct a model-based analysis of the macroeconomic performance of different monetary policy strategies when the policy rate is constrained by the effective lower bound (ELB). Under standard inflation targeting, inflation remains, on average, below target (disinflationary bias). ELB incidence and duration are higher the lower the target. A point inflation target performs better than a range, especially if compared to an asymmetric one with the focal point close to the ceiling. Makeup strategies (price level targeting and average inflation targeting) and asymmetric inflation targeting strategies, in which the central bank’s reaction to below-target inflation is stronger compared with the case of above-target inflation, reduce the disinflationary effects of the ELB and have better macroeconomic stabilization properties compared with standard inflation targeting.
