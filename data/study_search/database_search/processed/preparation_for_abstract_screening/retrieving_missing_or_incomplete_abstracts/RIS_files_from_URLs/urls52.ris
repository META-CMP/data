TI  - Coordinating Monetary and Fiscal Policies in an Open Economy
AU  - Chamberlin, Graeme
T2  - International Economics Letters
AB  - This paper looks at the possible coordination problems that might result when monetary and fiscal policies are operated by separate authorities. In an open economy the feedback from movements in the exchange rate to the rate of consumer price inflation means fiscal policy can have a non-neutral effect on output even if monetary policy acts to keep inflation at target. This might encourage governments to run an overly expansive fiscal policy at the expense of weakness in the tradable sector. Preventing this scenario might require the monetary authority to target a measure of domestically-generated inflation or have a separate target for the exchange rate. Alternatively the government could delegate the assessment of policy against its fiscal rules to an independent fiscal council.

TI  - Unraveling the Monetary Policy Transmission Mechanism in Sri Lanka
AU  - Ghazanchyan, Mr Manuk
AB  - In this paper we examine the channels through which innovations to policy variables— policy rates or monetary aggregates—affect such macroeconomic variables as output and inflation in Sri Lanka. The effectiveness of monetary policy instruments is judged through the prism of conventional policy channels (money/interest rate, bank lending, exchange rate and asset price channels) in VAR models. The timing and magnitude of these effects are assessed using impulse response functions, and through the pass-through coefficients from policy to money market and lending rates. Our results show that (i) the interest rate channel (money view) has the strongest Granger effect (helps predict) on output with a 0.6 percent decrease in output after the second quarter and a cumulative 0.5 percent decline within a three-year period in response to innovations in the policy rate; (ii) the contribution from the bank lending channel is statistically significant (adding 0.2 percentage point to the baseline effect of policy rates) in affecting both output and prices but with a lag of about five quarters for output and longer for prices; and (iii) the exchange rate and asset price channels are ineffective and do not have Granger effects on either output or prices.

TI  - Managing an Energy Shock: Fiscal and Monetary Policy
AU  - Auclert, Adrien
AU  - Monnery, Hugo
AU  - Rognlie, Matthew
AU  - Straub, Ludwig
AB  - This paper revisits the macroeconomic effects of energy price shocks in energy-importing economies. In standard representative-agent models, increases in energy prices trigger a boom in aggregate demand by reallocating spending towards domestic production. In heterogeneousagent models, by contrast, we show that they cause a recession by pushing down on real wages and therefore on consumer spending, provided that the elasticity of substitution between energy and domestic goods is realistically low. Imported energy inﬂation can spill over to wage inﬂation through a wage-price spiral, without mitigating the real wage decline. Monetary policy tightening has limited effect on imported inﬂation when done in isolation, but can be powerful when done in conjunction with other energy importers by lowering world energy demand. Fiscal policy, especially energy price subsidies, can isolate individual energy importers from the shock, but it has large negative externalities on other economies.

AB  - Most central banks follow either an implicit or explicit inflation target. Many leading economists promote an active role for central banks in pursuit of that target. In this article it is shown how that strategy does not necessarily lead to a neutral monetary policy and, therefore, to the smooth working of markets in the long run. Accordingly, it proposes a nominal income rule that removes monetary disturbances from the economy.

TI  - Money supply and inflation impact on economic growth
AU  - Doan Van, Dinh
T2  - Journal of Financial Economic Policy
AB  - Purpose At present, countries are concerned about inflation and the impact of inflation on each country’s economic growth. This inflation has been said by economists that inflation is a phenomenon of currency and currency, which has caused inflation in some countries by their monetary policy. According to the economic theory of Karl Marx, Irving Fisher, Friedman, inflation is caused by a continuous increase in the money supply. Design/methodology/approach The economic theories of Fisher, Friedman and an econometric model are applied to analyse the relationship between money supply and inflation. Besides, Vietnam’s and China’s research data are also collected in the period of 2012-2016. Findings It is found out that the continuous increase in the money supply causes inflation in the long-term, but the continuous increase in the money supply growth does not cause inflation in a short time, this was analyzed based on the theory of monetary quantity. Moreover, Chia’s and Vietnam’s correlations of the money supply growth and inflation are 99.1 per cent. These correlations are very close. Originality/value Research results show that money supply and inflation are closely related, and the money supply directly affects economic growth. Therefore, the government should have the relevant monetary policy to grow the economy and proposals to make monetary policy, control inflation levels and stimulate economic growth.

TI  - U.S. Monetary Policy and Commodity Prices: A SVECM Approach
AU  - Siami-Namini, Sima
T2  - Economic Papers: A journal of applied economics and policy
AB  - This article discusses how U.S. monetary policy shocks can influence commodity prices. Historically, a lot of studies in the literature have investigated the impact of short-term interest rates on different types of commodity prices. This article takes a more comprehensive approach and contributes to the literature by analysing the effect of both short- and long-term interest rates as well as M2 money stock on commodity prices at aggregate and sub-indices levels. The “B-model” variant of structural vector error correction models (SVECMs) is used to estimate the restricted contemporaneous impact matrix (SR) and the restricted long-term impact matrix (LR). Furthermore, SVECMs impulse response functions are used to evaluate the extent to which monetary policy shocks explain commodity prices. In contrast with the results of previous studies, we do not find evidence of a strong response pattern of commodity prices to monetary policy shocks in the short term. However, monetary policy shocks can explain commodity prices and their components in the long term. From a policy point of view, monetary authorities should exercise caution in using short-term effects of monetary policy instruments on commodity prices, given their long-term impact is inflationary while there are no beneficial short-term effects.

AB  - This study investigates the multidimensional aspects
of information in State Bank of Pakistan monetary policy; which
consists of the policy rate and the monetary policy statements
released by the Monetary Policy Committee. The effects of monetary policy communication and its tone on market expectations
and the subsequent effects on macroeconomic variables i.e. the
Consumer Price Index, output and credit intake is investigated.
The Johansen’s co-integration test showed existence of one cointegration equation; after which Vector Error Correction Model
(VECM) was estimated to establish the long and short run
relationships between variables. The language of monetary policy
communication Granger causes CPI and credit intake in the
short run. It was found that policy rate does not Granger cause
any of the variables used. Nonetheless, neither the language
of communication nor the policy rate have particularly strong
effects on macroeconomic variables.

T2  - Economic Record
AB  - A structural vector autoregression model is used to identify overvaluation in house prices in Australia from 2002 to 2008. An important feature is the development of a housing sector where long-run restrictions are derived from theory to identify housing demand and supply shocks. The results show strong evidence of overvaluation in real house prices, reaching a peak of just over 15 per cent by the end of 2003. Factors driving overvaluation are housing demand shocks before 2006 and post-2006 macroeconomic shocks. Wealth effects from equity markets are also important. The results suggest that monetary policy is not an important contributor to overvaluation of house prices.

T2  - Journal of International Money and Finance
AB  - Does the current account improve or deteriorate following a monetary policy expansion? We examine this issue theoretically and empirically. We show that a standard open economy DSGE model predicts that the current account response to a monetary policy shock depends on the degree of financial regulation. In particular, financial liberalisation makes it more likely that the current account deteriorates following a monetary expansion. We test this theoretical prediction with a varying coefficient Bayesian panel VAR model, where the coefficients are allowed to vary as a function of the degree of financial, product and labour market regulation on data from 1976Q1-2006Q4 for 19 OECD countries. Our empirical results support the theory. We therefore conclude that following a monetary policy expansion, the current account is more likely to go into deficit in countries with more liberalised financial markets.

AB  - This article analyzes the monetary policy of major central banks during the economic crisis generated by the COVID-19 pandemic. Rising public debt in many countries is being financed through asset purchases by monetary authorities. Although these stimulus policies predate the pandemic, they have been significantly boosted as many governments face large financing needs. We have been in a low interest rate environment for years and some governments have issued debt securities at negative rates. In addition, the rise of decentralized cryptocurrencies, based on blockchain technology, has created greater competition in the international monetary system and many governments have considered the creation of centralized virtual currencies, known as central bank digital currencies (CBDCs). We will analyze some relevant cases, with an emphasis on the digital euro project. The methodology is based on the analysis of the evolution of monetary variables. Pearson’s correlation will be used to establish some relationships between them. There is a strong similarity in the expansionary monetary policies of central banks. Although the growth of the money supply has not been passed on to the CPI, it has been passed on to the financial markets and the price of assets such as Bitcoin or gold.

AB  - The main purpose of this paper is estimation of monetary transmission mechanism in the post-stabilization experience of CIS-7 economy. Specifically, I set up a model consistent with economic theory and practical for monetary policy analysis within a structural vector autoregression (SVAR) framework. This model is used to study the real effects of monetary policy instruments and to determine the most significant channels of monetary transmission in Georgia. The paper finds that a shock in the exchange rate has more sound impact on the behavior of the economy than an interest rate shock and a foreign exchange interventions shock. Next, an external shock to the US interest rate has less significant impact on the Georgian economy than the domestic monetary policy shocks. Finally, a shock to the forex interventions is more important source of fluctuations in the exchange rate level than a shock to the interest rate.

The main objective of this research is to analyze the impact of monetary policy on the industrial sector. The appropriate model for time series data that is not stationary is the Vector Error Correction Model (VECM). This study involved quarterly data during 2010 to 2019 from Central Bank of Indonesia (BI) and Statistics Indonesia (BPS). The empirical results indicate that the industrial sector has a positive response to the shock of the BI interest rate variable. On the other hand, the industrial sector gave a negative response to shocks from the consumer price index variable and the BI interest rate. The results of the variance decomposition show that the largest percentage contribution is shown by the inflation variable as measured by the Consumer Price Index (CPI) and Foreign Direct Investment (FDI). Keywords: BI rate, Monetary policy, Industry sector, VECMJEL Classification E52, E58

As such, the paper examines what kind of monetary policy and transmission mechanisms are relevant to the Eritrean economy. It also addresses which channels are effective and which are not and why. Vector Autoregressive modelling is employed over the study period 1996Q1–2008Q4. This paper addresses the argument that the bank lending is the sole functioning channel in low income economies. We find that interest rate and official exchange rate channels are inoperative. However, effective exchange rate and credit channels exist through the black foreign exchange market and credit issued to the government sector. The main policy implication of this study is that the Bank of Eritrea might be able to control inflation through manipulating the reserve requirement ratio.

AU  - Syed, Mr Murtaza H.
AU  - Yamaoka, Hiromi
AB  - In responding to the global crisis, central banks in several advanced economies ventured beyond traditional monetary policy. A variety of unorthodox measures, including purchases of public and private assets, have significantly enlarged their balance sheets. As recoveries take hold, focus will increasingly shift from countering the Great Recession to orchestrating an exit and returning to a more normal monetary framework. Five years ago, as its economy recovered from a severe financial crisis, Japan attempted just such an exit. This note revisits the Bank of Japan’s experience and draws potential lessons for managing an orderly exit today, with a focus on technical aspects, practicalities, and communication strategies. While the nature of the assets acquired during the present crisis could pose additional complications, parts of Japan’s arsenal—communication, flexibility, a sufficient set of policy tools and a strategy for using them, safeguards against potential losses, the revival of risk appetite through decisive restructuring of balance sheets, and refinements to the monetary framework upon exit—also could be important this time around.

AB  - Understanding the degree of price stickiness and the nature of price setting is
necessary for analyzing the effects of monetary policy on economy. To the best
of our knowledge, no comprehensive study has examined the degree of price
stickiness in Iran yet. For this reason, we examine the basic features of retail
price setting behavior using a large data set containing the micro data
underlying the construction of the CPI over the period 2004:5 to 2011:9. First
we calculate the frequency and size of price changes for 359 categories of
consumer goods and services in order to obtain the degree of nominal rigidity
of consumer prices. We then investigate what models of price setting, including
time dependent and state dependent models, are more consistent with price
adjustment pattern in Iran. Based on our results, Consumer prices are highly
flexible and there is a high degree of downward rigidity. Also, there is a considerable amount of heterogeneity across sectors both in terms of the
frequency and size of price changes. The methods used in this paper for
identifying the pattern of pricing supports the existence of both time and statedependent pricing patterns.

AB  - We evaluate the macroeconomic performance of different monetary policy rules when there are bubbles in the exchange rate. We do this in the context of a non-linear rational expectations model. The exchange rate is allowed to deviate from its fundamental value and the persistence of the deviation is modeled as a Markov switching process. Our results suggest that reacting to exchange rate movements does not significantly improve welfare. However, taking into account the switching nature of the economy may be more beneficial.

AB  - Central banks have different objectives in the short and long run. Governments operate simultaneously at different timescales. Many economic processes are the result of the actions of several agents, who have different term objectives. Therefore, a macroeconomic time series is a combination of components operating on different frequencies. Several questions about economic time series are connected to the understanding of the behavior of key variables at different frequencies over time, but this type of information is difficult to uncover using pure time-domain or pure frequency-domain methods. To our knowledge, for the first time in an economic setup, we use cross-wavelet tools to show that the relation between monetary policy variables and macroeconomic variables has changed and evolved with time. These changes are not homogeneous across the different frequencies.

TI  - Monetary Policy Under Imperfect Capital Markets in a Small Open Economy
AU  - Tuladhar, Anita
T2  - American Economic Review
AB  - Following the financial crises of the late 1990's an increasing number of emergingmarket countries have adopted a flexible exchange-rate regime and an inflation-targeting monetary-policy framework. This trend has generated a growing debate on the appropriate monetary-policy rule for "financially fragile" economies with thin and incomplete financial markets that are subject to highly volatile capital flows. Within this context, I examine the implications of alternative monetary-policy rules and the choice of instruments and targets in a small open economy with imperfect capital markets. I compare a benchmark efficient-markets model with a monetary-targeting regime and three different inflation-targeting rules: the Taylor rule, a CPI inflation-target rule, and a non-tradable inflation-target rule. Furthermore, I study how sensitive the results are to varying degrees of capital-market integration. In addressing this question of the "second best" policy, the paper resembles that of Michael Devereaux and Phillip Lane (2001), who study the role of financial accelerator effects on various monetary-policy rules. I adopt a small open-economy setup rather than a two-country framework. In contrast to most small open-economy models, however, this paper does not assume a zero current-account balance. Net foreign-asset holdings and capital flows affect real volatility through the interest-rate risk premium. Given the significant role the risk premium plays in the external borrowing costs for emerging markets, this channel may have important consequences for economic dynamics.

TI  - The Impact of U.S. Monetary Policy Normalization on Capital Flows to Emerging-Market Economies
AU  - Dahlhaus, Tatjana
AU  - Vasishtha, Garima
AB  - The Federal Reserve's path for withdrawal of monetary stimulus and eventually increasing interest rates could have substantial repercussions for capital flows to emerging-market economies (EMEs). This paper examines the potential impact of U.S. monetary policy normalization on portfolio flows to major EMEs by using a vector autoregressive model that explicitly accounts for market expectations of future monetary policy. The "policy normalization shock" is defined as a shock that increases both the yield spread of U.S. long-term bonds and monetary policy expectations while leaving the policy rate per se unchanged. Results indicate that the impact of this shock on portfolio flows as a share of GDP is expected to be economically small. The estimated impact is closely in line with that seen during the end-May to August 2013 episode in response to a comparable rise in the yield spread of U.S. long-term bonds. However, as the events during the summer of 2013 have shown, relatively small changes in portfolio flows can be associated with significant financial turmoil in EMEs. Further, there is also a strong association between the countries that are identified by our model as being the most affected and the ones that saw greater outflows of portfolio capital over May to September 2013.

AB  - This paper estimates the effects of monetary policy based on a new, extensive real-time dataset for the United Kingdom. Employing the Romer-Romer identification approach we construct a new measure of monetary policy innovations and find that a 1 percentage point increase in the policy rate reduces output by 0.6 percent and inflation by up to 1 percentage point after 2 to 3 years. Our use of forecast data is shown to be crucial and that their omission generates the well-known price puzzle. Our estimates are more comparable to the wider VAR literature but we also reconcile our findings with the Romer-Romer estimates for the United States.

AB  - We examine how changes in capital requirements and monetary policy shocks affect corporate investment during a credit boom. Our empirical analysis uses data on SMEs in the UK between 1998 and 2006, a period when monetary policy and microprudential regulation were set by independent institutions. We find that an increase in bank-specific capital requirements led to a contraction in corporate debt and investment, but only for firms with short bank relationships. This suggests that relationships between firms and banks are crucial for the transmission of regulatory shocks. Long relationships also attenuate the impact of monetary policy shocks, but to a smaller degree than for capital requirement changes. We also find that the two policies do not dampen or amplify the effect of each other, but their effects vary with the size of banks’ capital buffers and the creditworthiness of firms.

T2  - Journal of International Studies
AB  - This paper aims at examining the relationship between macroeconomic
variables, the consumer price index, economic growth measured as Gross
domestic product (GDP), the nominal effective exchange rate NEER, the money
market rate TMM and the money supply M2 in the case of Tunisian economy.
After a brief overview of the theoretical discussions on the link between the
consumer price index and the macroeconomic variable as an essential condition
for an inflation targeting policy, we first present some observations for Tunisia.
The limit testing approach of cointegration and error correction models,
developed in an autoregressive distributed delay (ARDL) framework combined
with the CUSUM and CUSUMQ tests, is presented to the annual data for the
period 1990 to 2018 in order to examine whether there is a long-term equilibrium
relationship between the consumer price index and the key macroeconomic
variables. The result of the limit test indicates that there is a stable long-term
relationship between the consumer price index (CPI), economic growth, money
supply, and money market rate. The estimated results show that the variables in
the model are positively linked in the long and short term. This empirical evaluation shows the existence of predictable which is one of the main conditions
for the adoption of an inflation targeting policy.

AB  - We examine how unconventional monetary policy of the European Central Bank influences macroeconomic stability in Central and Eastern European economies. We estimate various panel vector autoregressions using monthly data from 2008-2014. Using the shadow policy rate and central bank assets as measures of unconventional policies, we find that output and prices in Central and Eastern Europe temporarily increase following an expansionary unconventional monetary policy shock by the European Central Bank. Using both impulse responses and variance decompositions, we find that the effect of unconventional policies on output is much stronger than the effect on inflation. In addition, our results provide evidence that unconventional policy tends to reduce market uncertainty and domestic interest rates but that the effect on the real exchange rate is not significant.

AB  - It has been known with time that no single transmission mechanism is enough to understand the monetary policy stance of that country. The objective of this paper is combine two transmission channel, interest rate and exchange rate so as to construct monetary condition index (MCI) for the gulf countries, namely Bahrain, Iraq, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and United Arab Emirates, so as to forecast its impact on CPI and GDP and to suggest policymakers regarding the monetary policy of the gulf countries. For this purpose, the paper applies Principal Component Analysis and Vector Auto-Regression method to construct MCI and to analyze its impulse response on CPI and GDP. This paper concludes that MCI can be used as an indicator to predict CPI and GDP of Bahrain and Qatar in long run and as an indicator to predict the GDP of Oman in medium and long run but it cannot be used as an indicator to predict CPI and GDP of Kuwait and KSA. Furthermore, this paper also concludes that strong monetary policy is needed to strengthen their economic condition.

AB  - Issues of inflation measurement are fundamental to the conduct of monetary policy. Price indices form the foundation of central bank policy frameworks around the world. They serve as guides to decision-making, as well as providing the primary mechanism for holding independent policymakers accountable. To shed some light on the role of inflation measurement, the annual meeting of Deputy Governors of emerging market economies (EMEs), held in Basel on 5-6 February 2009, explored three issues: Price indices used by central banks; the role of wages and productivity in inflation policy; and the measurement and assessment of inflation expectations. This volume contains contributions by senior central bankers and BIS staff. The issues are summarised in an overview chapter by Stephen Cecchetti. Price indices used by central banks. The primary price indicator or target of EME central banks is headline CPI, supplemented by other indicators. At least two issues of measurement arise. The first is transitory phenomena, or noise, that should not affect policymakers' actions. Many central banks deal with noise by using measures of underlying or core inflation that exclude certain prices from computation in the index. The second issue is measurement biases, related to the way in which individual prices are weighted together to form an aggregate index (weighting bias; eg substitution bias); or due to actual errors in measuring the individual prices themselves (eg quality or new goods bias). Wages, productivity and structural inflation. Wages are a key element in the inflation process: Wage growth equals productivity growth plus inflation and real wage growth that is in line with labour productivity growth is widely seen as a precondition for macroeconomic stability. In EMEs, a close relationship between real wage growth and labour productivity growth helps preserve external competitiveness while limiting inflationary pressures and the risk of a wage-price spiral developing. The adoption of inflation targeting frameworks by many emerging market central banks has provided an incentive to compile better labour market data and has enabled central banks to use productivity and unit labour costs more widely in their inflation forecasts. Other aspects of the role of wages in inflation are highlighted by two-sector models of differential productivity growth in tradable and non-tradable industries. One implication is that the rate of wage increase will depend on wage increase in the tradable sector. Another is that inflation sometimes reflect productivity growth in tradable industries, so not all inflation in rapidly-growing EMEs is necessarily undesirable or avoidable. Inflation expectations and monetary policy. Three issues may be highlighted that are discussed in this volume drawing on EME experience: (i) How central banks measure inflation expectations and use such measures; (ii) the relationship between inflation expectations and the costs of disinflation; and (iii) whether monetary policy frameworks are effective in anchoring inflation expectations. Measurements of expectations draw either on surveys (of households and businesses, professional forecasters and financial market participants) or financial markets (eg the difference in return between an inflation-linked bond and a nominal rate). As for the costs of disinflation, these are related to inflation persistence, which can in turn be related to expectations (eg backward-looking, or reflecting limited information about central bank objectives). Finally, the experience of central banks suggests that inflation expectations have been better anchored in this decade.

AB  - In this paper we deal with the recent (1995-2018) Federal Reserve operated monetary policies, which were two unprecedented and distinct monetary policy regimes. The inflation stabilization era (1995-2008) and the zero interest rate era (2008-2015). These different monetary policy regimes provided different outcomes for inflation, interest rates, financial markets, personal consumption, and real economic growth. Some of the important results are that monetary policy appears to be able to affect long-term real interest rates, risk, the prices of the financial assets, and very little the real personal consumption and the real economic growth. The Fed’s interest rate target was set during these seven years at 0% to 0.25%. We are trying to explain the low level of long-term interest rates and the negative real rate of interest (cost of capital). The evidence suggests that this monetary policy was not very effective; it has created a new bubble in the financial market, future inflation, and a redistribution of wealth from risk-averse savers to banks and risk-taker speculators. It has increased the risk (RP) by making the real risk-free rate of interest negative. The effects on growth and employment were gradual and small, due to outsourcing and unfair trade policies.

The study shows the absence of fiscal dominance in Indonesia and the ITF is moderately effective in achieving targeted inflation rate. Tightening monetary policy by Bank Indonesia is able to effect almost 30 per cent the change inflation variability after two year . Expansionary fiscal policy is only able to reduce the unemployment in a very short term. Which will potentially lead to inflation. The result suggest that in a short term the coordination of fiscal and monetary policy is needed and effective to achieve loer unemployment and minimize the gap between the targeted and actual inflation.

The optimality of the rule is explored through various specifications of a central bank loss function as it is the loss function that offers insight into central bank preferences. Many of the issues on this topic have centred on the role of the exchange rate: Is it optimal for the policy instrument to react to the exchange rate? What is the role of the exchange rate in a domestic inflation targeting vs CPI inflation targeting? Does a fear of floating have any bearing on the way optimal MPRs are constructed? While this paper is not empirical, the analysis is relevant for central banks in open and developing economies that face a choice between allowing exchange rates to float (and adopting an inflation targeting regime) and engaging in some degree of exchange rate fixity.

AB  - In this paper we quantitatively analyse monetary policy statements of the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) from 1998 to 2017, across the regimes of five governors. We first ask whether the content and focus of the statements have changed with the adoption of inflation-targeting as a framework for conducting monetary policy. Next, we study the influence of various aspects of monetary policy communication on financial markets. Using natural language processing tools, we construct measures of linguistic and structural complexity that capture governor-specific trends in communication. We find that while RBI’s monetary policy communication is linguistically complex on average, the length of monetary policy statements has gone down and readability has improved significantly in the recent years. We also find that there has been a persistent semantic shift in RBI’s monetary policy communication since the adoption of inflation-targeting. Finally, using a simple regression model we find that lengthier and less readable statements are linked to both higher trading volumes and higher returns volatility in the equity markets, though the effects are not persistent.

T2  - International Economics
AB  - This paper analyses whether European Central Bank (ECB) unconventional monetary policy (UMP) shocks contribute to the emergence of the global financial cycle. Using large-scale global VAR models, I assessed the possible effects of ECB UMP on financial and macroeconomic conditions in emerging markets and documented the channels through which potential spillovers occur, focusing on cross-border banking flows. I found that ECB UMP influences decisions made in the euro area (EA) banking system, leading to an increase in banking outflows. In turn, the rise of inflows to emerging market economies (EMEs) results in a significant response by financial variables, proving that ECB UMP is a driver of the financial conditions in EMEs. While these results represent general trends, there is evidence of cross-regional heterogeneity.

AB  - The main objective of the study is to provide a theoretical analysis of optimal monetary policy in a small open economy where households set real wage in a staggered fashion. The introduction of real wage rigidities plays a important role to resolve main shortcomings of the standard new Keynesian small open economy model. The main findings regarding the issue of monetary policy design can be summarized as three fold. First, the optimal policy is to seek to minimize variance of domestic price inflation, real wage inflation, and the output gap if both domestic price and real wage are sticky. Second, controlling CPI inflation directly or indirectly induces relatively large volatility in output gap and other inflations. Therefore, both CPI inflation-based Taylor rule and nominal wage-inflation based Taylor rule are suboptimal. Last, a policy that responds to a real wage inflation is most desirable.

T2  - European Economic Review
AB  - This paper evaluates VAR models designed to analyse the monetary policy transmission mechanism in the United States by considering three issues: specification, identification, and the effect of the omission of the long-term interest rate. Specification analysis suggests that only VAR models estimated on a single monetary regime feature parameters stability and do not show signs of mis-specification. The identification analysis shows that VAR-based monetary policy shocks and policy disturbances identified from alternative sources are not highly correlated but yield similar descriptions of the monetary transmission mechanism. Lastly, the inclusion of the long-term interest rate in a benchmark VAR delivers a more precise estimation of the structural parameters capturing behaviour in the market for reserves and shows that contemporaneous fluctuations in long-term interest rates are an important determinant of the monetary authority's reaction function.

AB  - Due to mismanagement alongside poor formulation and implementation of monetary and fiscal policies, level of economic development in Africa remains low. This study argued that African countries have great potentials to accelerate and sustain economic growth through effective monetary policies due to huge market potentials, growing population, and availability of manpower, untapped natural resources and other growth advantages provided effective policies are enacted. Against this backdrop, this study investigated the effect of monetary policy transmission mechanism and innovation in the banking system on economic growth in Nigeria. Data sourced from the Nigerian Central Bank Statistical Bulletin and World Development Indicators between 1981-2015 was engaged. The study adopted a vector auto-regression and auto-regressive distribution lag approaches for its analysis. The study revealed that, due to the large informal banking sector, monetary policies have not been effective and also supervisory and intermediary financial institutions lack dependence due to frequent government interventions.

AB  - Does monetary policy have persistent effects on the productive capacity of the economy? Yes, we find that such effects are economically and statistically significant and last for over a decade based on: (1) identification of exogenous monetary policy fluctuations using the trilemma of international finance; (2) merged data from two new international historical cross-country databases reaching back to the nineteenth century; and (3) econometric methods robust to long-horizon inconsistent estimates. Notably, the capital stock and total factor productivity (TFP) exhibit strong hysteresis, whereas labor does not; and money is non-neutral for a much longer period of time than is customarily assumed. We show that a New Keynesian model with endogenous TFP growth can reconcile these empirical findings.

TI  - Japan's Financial Crisis and Its Parallels to U.S. Experience
AU  - Mikitani, Ryōichi
AU  - Posen, Adam Simon
AB  - Japan is only one of many industrialized economies to suffer a financial crisis in the last fifteen years, but it has suffered the most from its crisis - as measured in lost output and investment opportunities, and in the direct costs of clean-up. Comparing the response of Japanese policy in the 1990s to that of U.S. monetary and financial policy to the American Savings and Loan Crisis of the late 1980s sheds light on the reasons for this outcome. This volume was created by bringing together several leading academics from the United States and Japan - plus former senior policymakers from both countries - to discuss the challenges to Japanese financial and monetary policy in the 1990s. The papers address in turn both the monetary and financial aspects of the crisis, and the discussants bring together broad themes across the two countries' experiences. As the papers in this Special Report demonstrate, while the Japanese government's policy response to its banking crisis in the 1990s was slow in comparison to that of the United States government a decade earlier, the underlying dynamics were similar. A combination of mismanaged partial deregulation and regulatory forebearance gave rise to the crisis and allowed it to deepen, and only the closure of some banks and injection of new capital into others began the resolution. The Bank of Japan's monetary policy from the late 1980s onwards, however, was increasingly out of step with U.S. or other developed country norms. In particular, the Bank of Japan's limited response to deflation after being granted independence in 1998 stands out as a dangerous and unusual stance.

AB  - Inflation Targeting Monetary Policy stance of Nigeria was examined using Taylor Policy Rule. The study used quarterly data from 2000:1 to 2010:4. Engle- Granger approach to co-integration was adopted and the results showed that implementation of monetary policy function was effectively done in order to achieve price stability in the economy that is characterized with persistent inflation for a very long time. The study therefore concluded that, monetary policy, in Nigeria context, needed to be supported by contractionary fiscal policy so as to be able to achieve the desired objectives.

AB  - This paper contributes to the debate by showing that the relationship between the monetary policy stance and bank risk taking is more complex than generally believed. Most of the debate so far has focused on how monetary policy easing can induce greater risk taking through a search for yield or its effects on leverage and asset prices, a view this paper broadly supports. But, at least in the short run, there is also an opposite risk-shifting effect when financial intermediaries operate with limited liability. The balance, then, depends on financial intermediaries’ degree of limited liability and financial health. When the policy rate is low, high-charter-value (well-capitalized) banks increase risk taking; low-charter-value (poorly capitalized) banks do the opposite.

AB  - Do changes in monetary policy affect inflation and output in the East African Community (EAC)? We find that (i) Monetary Transmission Mechanism (MTM) tends to be generally weak when using standard statistical inferences, but somewhat strong when using non-standard inference methods; (ii) when MTM is present, the precise transmission channels and their importance differ across countries; and (iii) reserve money and the policy rate, two frequently used instruments of monetary policy, sometimes move in directions that exert offsetting expansionary and contractionary effects on inflation—posing challenges to harmonization of monetary policies across the EAC and transition to a future East African Monetary Union. The paper offers some suggestions for strengthening the MTM in the EAC.

TI  - Effects of Monetary Policy on Bank’s Credit Dynamics in Tanzania
AU  - Mwankemwa, Lusajo P.
AU  - Mlamka, Bonaventura
T2  - African Journal of Economic Review
AB  - In a similar trend to other East African Community partner states, growth of credit to private sector in Tanzania has been declining in the recent past, despite massive effort by the monetary policy to boost bank’s credit extension. Using quarterly data spanning from 2002 to 2019, this paper estimates a structural vector autoregressive model to examine the intertwined relationships between monetary policy and growth of private sector credit, together with other key macroeconomic variables in Tanzania. Estimates from the model shows that the real effect of monetary policy on credit growth is quantitatively small — a 2.5% rise in cash rate leads to a decline in real growth of credit to the private sector by 0.1%. Though, in responding to the macroeconomic consequences of the shock in growth of private sector credit, monetary policy appears to stabilise the economy effectively. At short horizons, shocks to monetary policy found to be a significant driver of credit growth. Over longer horizons, shocks to real output, past shocks to credit growth and external shocks plays a greater role. The contemporaneous effects of external shocks to the growth of private sector credit takes slightly more than two years to disappears, but it would have taken much longer in the absence of a monetary policy response. These findings assert that, bank’s capacity to credit extension is vulnerable to both domestic and external shocks, and although it may be unfeasible for the monetary policy to fully caution the banking system from shocks, a quick and appropriate policy response may help banks to quickly recover from unexpected shocks.

TI  - Monetary Policy Rules in an Open Economy with Heuristics: Which Model Is Best?
AU  - Yeh, Kuo-chun
T2  - Emerging Markets Finance and Trade
AB  - The choices of policy targets and the formation of agents’ expectation have been critical issues for reconsidering monetary policy management since 2008. The purpose of this article is to evaluate macroeconomic stability in a New Keynesian open economy in which agents experience cognitive limitations. The (im)perfect credibility of various monetary policies (e.g., a Taylor-type rule, strict domestic inflation targeting, strict CPI inflation targeting, exchange rate peg) may lead agents to react according to their expectation rules, and then create various degrees of booms and busts in output and inflation. Therefore, relaxation of the rational expectation hypothesis has potential consequences for policy designs. Our simulations confirm that the business cycles induced by animal spirits are enhanced by strict inflation targeting. Furthermore, a Taylor-type (CPI or domestic inflation) rule or a credible exchange rate pegging system can improve social welfare and stability in an open economy.

AB  - This paper studies how the impact of monetary policy depends on the distribution of savings from refinancing mortgages. We show that the efficacy of monetary policy is state dependent, varying in a systematic way with the pool of potential savings from refinancing. We construct a quantitative dynamic life-cycle model that accounts for our findings and use it to study how the response of consumption to a change in mortgage rates depends on the distribution of savings from refinancing. These effects are strongly state dependent. We also use the model to study the impact of a long period of low interest rates on the potency of monetary policy. We find that this potency is substantially reduced both during the period and for a substantial amount of time after interest rates renormalize.

AB  - Using VAR models for the USA, we find that a contractionary monetary policy shock has a persistent negative impact on the level of commercial bank assets, but increases the assets of shadow banks and securitization activity. To explain this “waterbed” effect, we propose a standard New Keynesian model featuring both commercial and shadow banks, and we show that the model comes close to explaining the empirical results. Our findings cast doubt on the idea that monetary policy can usefully “get in all the cracks” of the financial sector in a uniform way.

AB  - This study examined the transmission channel of monetary policy to real economy in Sierra Leone using quarterly data from 2002 to 2018. The non-recursive structural vector autoregressive technique was employed to identify the channel of monetary policy transmission to the real economy. This technique was considered appropriate because it has two-way or bidirectional causal effects among endogenous variables and ordering of endogenous variables are considered flexible. Analysis of data shows that the exchange rate channel was found to be appropriate in transmitting monetary policy effect to real economy based on the results of impulse response and variance decomposition analysis. In light of the empirical findings, the study recommended that in a bid to have an effective monetary policy, the channels of monetary policy transmission, especially the exchange rate channel, should be taken into consideration in the design of monetary policy in Sierra Leone.

AB  - The well-known “Quantitative Easing” (QE) is a kind of non-traditional monetary policy. The United States and Japan are two typical examples that executed non-traditional monetary policies on a large-scale since 2000s. This research uses multiple regression analysis to examine the effects of non-traditional monetary policies abroad on housing prices in Taiwan. More specifically, the research would like to find out whether the mechanism of monetary transmission could successfully transmit the shocks of external monetary policies to the internal housing market. The empirical result indicates that the four QE factors had inconsistent outcomes. Japan QE and US QE1 are significantly negative related with Cathay housing price index, and while US QE2 and US QE3 are positive related to the index, the results are not significant. There is an inconsistent conclusion among non-traditional monetary policy. Moreover, the government policy is significantly and positively related with index. It indicates that government policy can’t restrain the increasing housing price index. Finally, all of the macroeconomic variables match the research expectation, except for population growth rate.

TI  - Monetary Policy and the Taylor Principle in Open Economies
AU  - Linnemann, Ludger

T2  - International Finance
AB  - Nowadays, central banks mostly conduct monetary policy by setting nominal interest rates. A widely held view is that central banks can stabilize inflation if they follow the Taylor principle, which requires raising the nominal interest rate more than one-for-one in response to higher inflation. Is this also correct in an economy open to international trade? Exchange rate changes triggered by interest rate policy might interfere with inflation stabilization if they alter import prices. The paper shows that this destabilizing effect can prevail if (a) the central bank uses consumer (rather than producer) prices as its inflation indicator or directly reacts to currency depreciation, and (b) if it bases interest rate decisions on expected future inflation. Thus, if the central bank looks at current inflation rates and ignores exchange rate changes, Taylor-style interest rate setting policies are advisable in open economies as well.

AU  - Coulibaly, Seydou
T2  - African Development Review
AB  - This paper contributes to the emerging literature on the socioeconomic impacts of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic by using a panel fixed effects model for estimating the impact of government policy responses to the pandemic and their spillover effects on the consumer price index for West African Economic and Monetary Union (WAEMU) countries over the period January 2019–July 2020. Across various robustness checks, the OLS and IV regressions provide three major pieces of evidence. First, the COVID-19 confirmed cases positively affect the consumer price index while the overall government policy responses index has a negative impact on the consumer price index. Second, we find that government accommodative policies to COVID-19 in other countries has a positive and statistically significant impact on the host country's consumer price index. Finally, the findings indicate that world food prices and oil prices positively affect the consumer price index. These results suggest that policymakers may consider intensifying the implementation of public policies in response to the pandemic for preserving the stability of prices when the sanitary situation of the COVID-19 deteriorates. While confirming that international prices are among the key drivers of inflation in WAEMU countries, our findings also reiterate the importance of regional cooperation and coordination for fighting the adverse socioeconomic impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic.

AB  - In this paper we have examined the cointegration with German aggregates of real and nominal aggregates and prices in transition-economy candidates for EU membership and with those  of countries that have recently joined the EU and with market-economy candidates for EU membership. Based on rolling cointegration tests, we find that the recent members of the EU exhibit significant and pervasive cointegration between their macroeconomic aggregates and prices and those of Germany, which we take as the historical proxy for the EU. The transition-economy candidates exhibit greater cointegration in measures of real activity, such as industrial output and in prices. There is considerably less integration in the money base and in monetary aggregates. This may reflect the dominance of real processes such as trade and capital flows over the domestic monetary policy of the transition economies. This suggests that there is considerably more leeway for monetary authorities in these economies in framing their approach to EU membership and to formulating monetary policy than previously thought.

T2  - International Journal of Finance & Economics
AB  - This paper studies the heterogeneous responses of firms to monetary policy shocks and the possible adverse effect of expansionary monetary policy on resource reallocation. Using Chinese firm-level data, we find that when expansionary monetary shock hits the economy, less productive firms are more responsive than productive firms in terms of resource accumulation. We identify two mechanisms for this effect. First, less productive firms accumulate net worth more slowly. They have higher leverage ratio and are more sensitive to monetary policy changes (the intensive margin). Second, monetary expansion relaxes borrowing constraints, which enables unproductive firms to survive. The congestion effect prevents resources from allocating to more productive firms. Our finding is robust even if we use private firm subsamples or avoid the massive fiscal stimulus in China around 2009. We provide a simple model of firm dynamics to capture these effects.

TI  - An Analysis of the Literature on International Unconventional Monetary Policy
AU  - Neely, Christopher J.
AU  - Bhattarai, Saroj
AB  - This paper reviews and critically evaluates the empirical literature on the effects of U.S. unconventional monetary policy on both financial markets and the real economy. In order to understand how such policies could work, we also briefly review the literature on the theory of such policies. We show that event studies provide very strong evidence that U.S. unconventional policy announcements have strongly influenced international bond yields, exchange rates, and equity prices in the desired manner. In addition, such studies indicate that such policies curtailed market perceptions of extreme events. Calibrated modeling and vector autoregressive (VAR) exercises strongly suggest that these policies significantly improved macroeconomic outcomes, raising U.S. GDP and CPI, through these changes in asset prices. Both event studies and VARs imply positive international spillovers of such policies.

TI  - Effects of Monetary and Macro-Prudential Policies – Evidence from Inflation Targeting Economies in the Asia-Pacific Region and Potential Implications for China
AU  - Kim, Soyoung
AU  - Mehrotra, Aaron N.
AB  - We examine the effects of monetary and macroprudential policies in the Asia-Pacific region, where many inflation targeting economies have adopted macroprudential policies in order to safeguard financial stability. Using structural panel vector autoregressions that identify both monetary and macro-prudential policy actions, we show that tighter macroprudential policies used to contain credit growth have also had a significant negative impact on macroeconomic aggregates such as real GDP and the price level. The similar effects of monetary and macroprudential policies may suggest a complementary use of the two policies at normal times. However, they could also create challenges for policy-makers, especially during times when low inflation coincides with buoyant credit growth.

AB  - This chapter attempts to analyze the effectiveness of monetary policy in Bangladesh by identifying various transmission channels. Structural Vector Autoregressive (SVAR) model has been applied to the monthly data between 1989 M1 and 2018 M12. Positive innovation in broad money supply causes an increase in price level and bank credit, but only in the short run. Expansionary monetary policy also influences nominal exchange rate of Taka. However, the study suggests that structural weaknesses of the financial system and lack of dynamic adjustments of policy rates be the key reasons for which monetary policy appears to be less effective in Bangladesh.

AU  - Pierdzioch, Christian
AU  - Kamps, Christophe
AB  - This paper studies the relative performance of alternative monetary policy rules in the presence of oil price shocks in a small open economy optimizing model. Our analysis shows that it is important to distinguish between alternative price indices (CPI, core CPI, and GDP deflator) when modeling the effects of oil price increases. This distinction has important implications for monetary policy as the central bank has to decide which inflation rate to target. Our results demonstrate that targeting the change in the GDP deflator is an inferior monetary policy strategy in the presence of oil price shocks.

AB  - By building on the Hamilton (1989) Markov switching model, we examine questions like: Does monetary policy have the same effect in expansions and recessions? Given that the economy is currently in a recession, does a fall in interest rates increase the probability of an expansion? Does monetary policy have an incremental effect on the growth rate within a given state, or does it only affect the economy if it is sufficiently strong to induce a state change (e.g., from recession to expansion)? As suggested by models with sticky prices or finance constraints, interest rate changes have larger effects during recessions.

AB  - In this paper, we analyze whether a monetary policy based on three main variables (inflation, money supply, and output gap) has a nonlinear impact on real estate investment trust (REIT) markets. In addition, we extend our analysis to examine whether these monetary policy components impact the possibility of boom and bust regimes occurring in the market. Empirically, we propose different Markov-switching model variants to determine the nonlinear time-varying impact of monetary policy on the REIT market. Our results show the monetary policy environment is supposed to affect, on one hand, the REIT returns and, on the other hand, the possibility of boom and bust markets. We prove that expansionary monetary policy has an impact only in the case of boom market. However, an increase in the inflation rate decreases the probability of remaining in the bust regime. As a consequence, we have already outlined several monetary transmission mechanisms that show house prices to have important effects on aggregate demand. Our results confirm that REIT markets are not efficient.

T2  - 5th International Conference on Computer Sciences and Convergence Information Technology
AB  - China's monetary authority applies monetary policy instruments of both money supply and interest rates. This paper estimates the impact of positive monetary policy shocks (money supply shock and interest rate shock) on house price, and assesses the effects of house price shock on the real economy, using SVAR model spanning the period of 2001Q1 to 2009Q4. In the money supply system, the impacts of money supply shock on the GDP, CPI and house price are modest. Hence, the effectiveness of money supply as a dominant policy instrument in China should be questioned. In the interest rates system, the unexpected change in interest rate has significant effects on the house price, output and consumer price index, which indicates that the impact of interest rate as monetary policy instrument has become stronger over the last decade. In both monetary systems, house price shock affects the real economy strongly. This implicates that house price plays an important role in the Chinese monetary policy system.

TI  - Achieving Price Stability in Nigeria: Monetary Policy Rate Approach vs. Foreign Exchange Policy Approach
AU  - Oseni, Jimoh Ezekiel
AB  - Earlier studies have reached a consensus that monetary policies generate more economic activities than fiscal policies in developing economies. This study has bridged the existing gaps in earlier studies by addressing the question of which of the instruments of macroeconomics is more effective in achieving price stability remains largely unanswered. The study observed that the presence of exogenous factor was responsible for the inability of the tight monetary policies of the CBN to mob excess liquidity from the economy. In the same vein, the exogenous factor destabilizes the steady economic growth that would have emanated from a relaxed monetary policy. The study also found foreign exchange rates (fx) to be a more effective instrument to achieving price stability than monetary policy rates (mpr). The Nigerian economy is largely import dependent with most of the importation being consumable goods and services and less of productive (capital) goods. The impact of changes in fx are more pronounced on the economy than changes in the interest rates. The attainment of price stability would become feasible if the apex bank accords priority to the formulation and deployment of foreign exchange policies that are sound in principle and effective in practice.

TI  - Effectiveness of Monetary Policy Tools in Countering Inflation in Kenya
AU  - Cheruiyot, John K.
AB  - The effect of monetary policy actions affects the general levels of retail prices prevailing in the Country from time to time. Through its monetary policy tools the Government of Kenya is able to control the levels of inflation reported in Kenya. The Central Bank of Kenya (CBK), like most other central banks around the world, is entrusted with the responsibility of formulating and implementing monetary policy directed at achieving and maintaining low inflation as one of its two principal objectives; the other being to maintain a sound market-based financial system. This study set to establish the effectiveness of monetary policy tools in countering inflation in Kenya. 

The study employed correlational research design. The study used time series empirical data on the variables to describe and examine the effectiveness of monetary policy tools in countering inflation in Kenya by establishing correlation coefficients between the inflation and the monetary policy tools. The study used secondary data on the Consumer Price Index for inflation, 91-day Treasury bill rate, exchange rate, money supply (M3) and repo rate. The analyses entailed the computation of the various coefficients of correlation denoted as in the model to determine the effectiveness of monetary policy tools in countering inflation in Kenya. 

The study established that inflation and the money supply were positively correlate with each other. As money supply circulating around the economy increases inflation also increases. An increase in money supply leads to people spending the excess of their money supply over money demand. The study also established that exchange rate policyhas an important role in reducing or minimizing the risk of fluctuations in exchange rates, which will have an impact on the economy. Any changes in exchange rates will have a great impact on the economy. 

The study recommends that the policy makers need to keenly consider the levels of money supply in Kenya so as to ensure a stable retail price levels. The study also recommends that the Government evaluate the prevailing levels of retail prices and set the interest rates on the 91-day Treasury bills because they are majorly treated as risk free rate hence determine other interest rates and inflation levels in Kenya.

TI  - Regional effects of monetary policy: Turkey case
AU  - Duran, Hasan Engin
AU  - Erdem, Umut
AB  - Monetary policy is primarily designed for national purposes, say price stability. However, its impact may vary significantly across regions. Why some regions respond more strongly to monetary policy is a challenging topic both theoretically and empirically. Indeed, three main hypothesis on this issue have been put forward: (i) regions with high share of manufacturing, (ii) regions that include higher proportion of small-scale firms and banks, (iii) regions which are more open to trade are likely to respond more strongly to changes in monetary policy. Although these hypotheses have been thoroughly and heatedly discussed by a strand of scholars, far little attention has been paid to the role of geographical factors and spatial spillovers. In fact, we precisely address this issue. Aim of the present paper is to examine the validity of three hypotheses and, additionally, the role of spatial spillovers in regional monetary transmission mechanism in Turkey. Our analyses indicate three major results: First, provinces respond quite heterogeneously to unexpected changes in monetary policy. Second, spatial spillovers and geographical proximity clearly matter in monetary transmission such that neighboring regions are likely to exhibit similar reactions to monetary policy. Third, among the hypothesis above bank size and trade openness are found to be significant.

TI  - Inflation dynamics and monetary policy strategy: some prospects for the Turkish economy
AU  - Us, Vuslat
T2  - Journal of Policy Modeling
AB  - This paper analyzes the dynamics of inflation in the Turkish economy, which has experienced increasingly high levels of inflation over the last 30 years. By conducting a Vector Autoregression (VAR) analysis, the variance decomposition (VDC) and the impulse response functions (IRF) show that the relatively high and inertial nature of inflation mainly stems from the increases in public sector prices and the depreciation of the Turkish lira. On the other hand, the Granger causality tests as well as the VDC and IRF demonstrate that high prices have not been as a result of an expansionary monetary policy. These results together with the previous results show that inertial inflation is not a monetary phenomenon in Turkey, but rather an outcome of a political misconduct, which therefore shows the fiscal dominance.

TI  - Monetary Policy Shocks and Business Cycle Fluctuations in a Small Open Economy: Sweden 1986-2002
AU  - Lindé, Jesper
AB  - This paper contains an empirical analysis of the dynamic effects of monetary policy on Swedish data within a framework consistent with the theoretical New-Keynesian type of small open economy models. Because of what appears to be time-varying seasonal patterns in the data, I argue that it is of crucial importance to use the annual inflation rate rather than the quarterly inflation rate in the empirical analysis. After a monetary policy shock, the impulse response functions for output and inflation display a hump-shaped pattern with peak effects after 1.5 - 2 years. There also seems to be considerable inertia in the real exchange rate. Sensitivity analysis suggests that the shape of the obtained impulse response functions is fairly robust with respect to the number of lags in the VAR, sample size, and the formulation of the policy rule. Also, we find evidence that foreign shocks are very important for understanding Swedish business cycles. In particular, they account for a large fraction of the lower frequency movements in output and inflation, whereas domestic shocks generate most of the high frequency movements in the data.

AB  - This paper focuses on the role of the banking sector in monetary policy transmission in an emerging economy with a rapidly developing financial system. Specifically, we examine whether the central bank's monetary policy stance affects banks' lending behavior. Based on a comprehensive quarterly dataset on all Russian banks from 1Q1999 to 1Q2007, we find evidence for the existence of a bank lending channel in Russia. Contrary to several studies on developed economies, the level of a bank's capitalization matters for the transmission process. Better capitalized banks are less likely to adjust their lending practices following a change in the monetary policy stance.

AB  - This study looks at the impact of monetary policy on South African agriculture, making use of the linkages that exist between interest rates, the macroeconomic environment and the agricultural sector. Utilising yearly data from 1970 to 2011, this study empirically investigates the impact of monetary policy on agricultural gross domestic product in South Africa using Vector Error Correction Model (VECM). The study finds that inflationary shocks and the money market rate have an enormous negative impact on the performance of the Agricultural GDP whilst the manufacturing index and the stock market help to improve the agricultural GDP. A unit increase in money market rate results in a decrease in the Agricultural GDP by approximately 0.021 percentage points. The study concludes that it is imperative for South Africa’s monetary policy authorities’ and agricultural sector policy makers as well participants to consider carefully the interaction between the macroeconomic environment, agricultural sector and stock prices.

TI  - Monetary policy shocks and foreign investment income: Evidence from a large Bayesian VAR
AU  - Auer, Simone
T2  - Journal of International Money and Finance
AB  - This paper assesses the transmission of monetary policy in a large Bayesian vector autoregression based on the approach proposed by Banbura et al. (2010). The paper analyzes the impact of monetary policy shocks in the United States and Canada not only on a range of domestic aggregates, trade flows, and exchange rates, but also foreign investment income. The analysis provides three main results. First, a surprise monetary policy contraction has a statistically important impact on both gross and net foreign investment income flows in both countries. Against the background of growing foreign wealth and investment income, this result provides preliminary evidence that foreign balance-sheet channels might play an increasingly significant role for monetary transmission. Second, the impact of monetary policy on foreign investment income flows differs considerably across asset categories and over time, suggesting that the investment instruments and the currency denomination of a country’s foreign assets and liabilities are potentially relevant for the way in which monetary policy affects the domestic economy. Finally, the results support existing evidence on the effectiveness of large vector autoregressions and the Bayesian shrinkage approach in eliminating price and exchange rate puzzles.

AB  - This paper studies international transmission of U.S. monetary policy shocks to commodity exporters and importers. After first showing empirically that the shocks have stronger effects on commodity exporters than on importers using structural VARs, I then augment a standard three-country model to include commodities. Consistent with the empirical evidence, the model indicates that an expansionary monetary policy shock to the U.S. increases the aggregate output of commodity exporters by more than that of importers. This is primarily because the increased U.S. aggregate demand triggered by the shock leads to greater U.S. demand for commodities and higher commodity prices, and thus the exports of commodity exporters increase relative to those of commodity importers.

TI  - External shock, monetary policy and the domestic economy: A structural VAR approach for Bangladesh
AU  - Rahman, A.K.M. Atiqur
T2  - The Journal of Developing Areas
AB  - , Economies around the world are interdependent with one another in the present era of globalization. While some global shocks may affect the countries of the world together, domestic policies of a country sometimes can hardly work independent of external factors. Keeping these in view, a large body of literature has developed to address the impact of external shock on domestic economy as well as examining effectiveness of domestic policy in the context of an open economy. While effectiveness of monetary policy has been well studied in the context of both developed world as well as in the developing countries, only a few studies have been conducted in this field in Bangladesh and all these studies are made in a closed economy framework. Moreover, there is no study to formally examine the impact of external shock in Bangladesh. On this backdrop, the present paper makes an attempt to simultaneously assess the impact of external shock and that of monetary policy on the economy of Bangladesh. It builds up a structural vector autoregression (SVAR) model of Bangladesh in an open economy set up. Contemporaneous restrictions are set based on the spirit of the existing literature and the specific condition of Bangladesh economy. The SVAR model is estimated with quarterly data ranging from the year 1989 to 2013. Impulse response function and the variance decomposition analysis are used in exploring the importance of monetary policy and external shocks in explaining variation in domestic price level and output. Estimated Impulse response functions show that innovation in reserve money has a positive impact on price and output, although impact on price level is less significant. On the other hand external shocks seem to have more prominent impact on the domestic economy. Innovation in OECD GDP also has significant positive impact on domestic output of Bangladesh. Shocks in foreign price have an immediate positive impact on domestic prices. Variance decomposition exercise shows that external shocks weight more in explaining variation in domestic price and output compared to the monetary policy. Furthermore, effectiveness of monetary policy in the open economy model of Bangladesh economy seems to be lower compared to that in a closed economy version of the economy, implying that exposure to the rest of the world dilutes the effectiveness of domestic policy of Bangladesh. The findings have important implications. First, as monetary expansion has positive impact on price level, monetary tightening would be the right policy in controlling inflation. However, this may not always bring high success if the external factors are not favorable as the study finds importance of external factor affecting both price level and GDP. On the other hand, as innovation in OECD GDP has positive impact on GDP of Bangladesh, global recovery may have a positive stimulus to GDP growth of the country.

TI  - Monetary Policy and Price Stability in Nigeria
AU  - Ltd, ICB-InterConsult Bulgaria
T2  - Academic Journal of Economic Studies
AB  - Irregular price changes, with its economic consequences of market risks and uncertainties, have been one of the most challenging problems facing the Nigerian economy. Successive financial sector reforms, which seek to enhance the role of monetary policy instruments in macroeconomic management, in view of the theoretical and empirical link between monetary policy and general price level, have been implemented with less than satisfactory results. This paper examines the monetary policy in stabilizing price level in Nigeria. We employ the Vector Autoregressive (VAR) model, with in-built differencing to take care of unit root in these time series data, to capture this relationship. From our findings, we discover that, money supply has no significant relationship with price level in Nigeria. This, we believe, may be due to the influence of the large informal financial sector which controls a very significant fraction of money in circulation. Thus, policy reforms that would curb the influence of the informal financial sector should be implemented in order to allow the central monetary authority to work better, and enhance the role of monetary management in Nigeria.

TI  - An Assessment of the Effectiveness of Monetary Policy in South Africa
AU  - Ltd, ICB-InterConsult Bulgaria
T2  - Acta Universitatis Danubius. Œconomica
AB  - The total economy is affected by inflation which should be effectively controlled to support economic growth. However, in recent years there has been evidence of inefficiencies of inflationary control in South Africa as the country is faced with both structural and cost-push inflation in a low growth economy. The objective of this study was to investigate whether these inflation types are effectively controlled through the utilisation of interest rates and money supply by the South African Reserve Bank (SARB). Secondary data from the SARB were collected for 69 quarters from 2000 Q1to 2017 Q1. An auto regressive distributive lag model (ARDL) was used to analyse the data for longrun co-integration while an error correction model (ECM) tested for short-run relationships. Variables included the consumer price index (CPI), money supply, interest rate (repo rate), government expenditure as well as trade openness. The results indicated that both long- and short-run relationship sexist between the variables. The study revealed that structural and cost-push inflation exists in South Africa, making the current methods of monetary policy implementation less effective in controlling inflation as well as having an impact on economic growth.

TI  - Asymmetric effect of monetary policy on Indian stock market sectors: Do monetary policy stimulus transpire the same effect on all sectors?
AU  - Tomar, Kunwar Sanjay
AU  - Kesharwani, Subodh
T2  - Cogent Economics & Finance
AB  - Most studies for the monetary policy effect on stock markets have concentrated on using the primary index to proxy the stock market. The present paper, avoiding “aggregation bias”, seeks to unbundle the effect of monetary policy on the stock market in two ways. First, the non-linear model is used. Second, sector-level monetary policy variable association and strength is known. Nonlinear Auto-Regressive Distributed Lag method (NARDL) has been used to separate the effect of monetary policy implications. The positive and negative separation of monetary policy variables shows meaningful information relating to each sector. Furthermore, the NARDL model provides the Error Correction equation for future prediction of the sector performance. The Error Correction Term (ECT) is significant for all the sectors, besides Information Technology. While ECT is highest for the Power sector, the lowest is reported for the Metal sector. Inflation increase has substantially more effect on sectors then its decrease. For short-run, real exchange rate positive (REER_POS (−2)), with a lag of 2 months, is effective for all the sectors. The health care sector stands out in its sensitivity to monetary policy variables. The asymmetric response of the Sector equity markets to monetary policy variables throws new insight for the policymakers, business managers, and fund managers. The nonlinearity can be helpful for business managers to relate revenue and valuation to monetary policy. Likewise, the portfolio fund managers can prepare for the expected changes in the economy to reallocate and rebalance their portfolios.

TI  - A Vector AutoRegressive Model for the Monetary Policy in the countries of the Euro Area during the crisis
AU  - Kalfas, Ioannis
AU  - Zina, Eleni
AB  - In this dissertation, we are going to investigate the effects of the monetary policy and monetary policy shocks on several fundamental economic variables, including the Gross Domestic Product, the Interest Rates and the Consumer Price Index for 4 European countries , Cyprus, Greece, Ireland and Portugal, that faced the most issues during the recession which initially started in 2008/2009 and continues until the time of writing (October 2016). This study offers results for the period under which the Euro became the only currency among the countries of the Euro area. Our goal is to provide evidence about the monetary policy implicated by the European Central Bank and the response of the 4 countries’ major macroeconomics variables to monetary policy shocks. Using a Vector Autoregressive model (VAR) for each of the 4 countries, we also try to estimate the impact of changes of shocks to gross domestic product and prices, with the help of impulse responses to each variable mentioned above. The main findings of our study indicate monetary policy shocks have a very small effect on both the Gross Domestic Product and the Consumer Price Index, which is expected, since the Eurozone and the European Central Bank have imposed a low interest rate policy to keep inflation at very low levels. Additionally, a monetary policy shock on rates would lead to a small but steady decline of the effect on the rates themselves over the time period. In this study, we have also investigated the effects of a shock to the GDP and the CPI of each country on the rates , which are interesting . In all countries, a shock in the GDP lead to a boom over the period of 2 quarters and then it remains pretty st able for the remaining quarters. As far as the shock to CPI is concerned, in Ireland and Portugal we depict an increase at first quarters , but then it starts deteriorating, without dying for the scrutinized period, which is 8 quarters. On the other hand, f or both Greece and Cyprus , the shocks to CPI have less effect on rates.

AB  - Policy rates have on aggregate been below the levels implied by the Taylor rule for most of the period since the early 2000s in both advanced and emerging market economies. This finding suggests that monetary policy has probably been systematically accommodative for most of the past decade. The deviation may, however, in part also reflect lower levels of equilibrium real interest rates that might introduce an upward bias in the traditional Taylor rule.

AB  - As a result of the financial problems that emerged with the 2008 global crisis, central banks have developed non-traditional monetary policies within macroprudential policies due to protect the financial structure. In this context, the Central Bank of the Republic of Turkey (CBRT) has established a new monetary policy framework covering financial stability as of 2010. The aim of this study is to analyze the effectiveness of monetary policy tools applied for financial stability in Turkey. In the study, the effectiveness of monetary policy instruments applied for financial stability in the period 2010-2016 was analyzed within the VAR model. According to the results of the study, a meaningful causality relationship was found between the instruments of monetary policy applied to financial stability and the variables of financial stability. The findings of the analysis show that monetary policy instruments used by the CBRT within the new monetary policy have contributed to financial stability when used together.

AU  - Emilia, Popa Coralia
T2  - Annals of Faculty of Economics
AB  - In the context of sovereign debt crisis in Europe, a crisis entirely felt also in the direct relation between credit institutions, the National Bank of Romania (NBR) adopted a monetary policy strategy meant to determine the reinforcement of its image, by initiating in the autumn of 2011 a new series of reduction of the monetary policy interest rate and implicitly the appropriate resizing of liquidity conditions. By increasing the role of liquidity adjustment, the European Central Bank (ECB) succeeded to determine in the money market the decrease of interbank rate interests under the interest rate level of monetary policy. The direct inflation targeting strategy used by the European Central Bank in applying its monetary policy has the first criterion of implementation the expression of inflation target in terms of â€žheadline inflationâ€ (consumer price index - CPI) given that the economic market in Romania is familiar with this indicator. Also, the main criterion considered by the investment segment of the market to achieve capital infusions in economic transactions is represented by the consumer price index, this one ensuring the necessary transparency related to the effects of inflation phenomenon. A strong argument supporting the use of consumer price index in monetary policy is represented by its upward flexibility towards the limited effectiveness of monetary aggregates in sizing inflationary anticipations. The downward slope of inflation phenomenon, in whose depreciation the evolution of consumer price index, whose positive trend surprised the European Central Bank, played a significant role, determined adjustments in the monetary policy strategy of the National Bank of Romania and at the same time the achievement of the inflationary target proposed with a direct effect on the monetary policy interest rate. The same measure to reduce the key interest rate is outlined in the monetary policy of the European Central Bank and it is mainly due to the decrease of inflation phenomenon, although at the end of 2011 important quantities of liquidities were introduced in the financial system. It remains to be analysed to what extent the inflation phenomenon will be possible to manage under the conditions of the renewal of economic instability in the euro area and to which direction this aspect will influence the monetary policy of the National Bank of Romania.

TI  - An Empirical Investigation into the effect of Monetary Policy and Inflation on the Exchange rate in Ghana
AU  - Allor, Precious
T2  - 2019 Awards for Excellence in Student Research and Creative Activity – Documents
AB  - The Ghanaian Cedi has recently experienced persistent depreciation against it's major trading partners. This paper investigates the role inflation and monetary policy plays in the persistent depreciation. The paper makes use of the ARDL and Bounds test of co-integration as well as the Toda & Yamamoto (1995) Augmented Granger Causality test to determine the long and short run dynamics of the impact of monetary policy and inflation on exchange rates in Ghana, using data ranging from 1970 to 2017. The paper finds short-run depreciation effect of contractionary monetary policy on the exchange rate, reflecting the exchange rate puzzle. The long run results however show an appreciating effect. Inflation is also found to depreciate the currency both in the short and long-run. The causality tests also reveal a bi-directional relationship between the exchange rate and the inflation rate, while a unidirectional causal relationship exists between monetary policy and the exchange rate. The paper recommends that inflation stabilization policies should be prioritized in Ghana, as a means to curb the rising exchange rates. Improvement in the terms of trade through export promotion should also be given the needed attention as this is found to appreciate the currency in the long-run.

AB  - We document the transmission of monetary policy and risk-premium shocks in Hungary, by applying recent advances in the Bayesian estimation of large VAR models. The method allows extracting information from over 100 series, opening the "black box" of the transmission mechanism to provide the most comprehensive description to date of the impact of these two shocks on the economy under the inflation-targeting regime. We find novel evidence that most of the channels of transmission are operational in Hungary, in spite of large liability euroization and high foreign ownership of banks and corporations. Due to financial stability concerns, monetary policy responds procyclically to risk-premium shocks. We also find that the use of such a large panel of data improves inflation forecasting performance over smaller models and renders this model suitable for policy purposes.

AB  - This paper utilizes differences in de jure deposit insurance coverage across banks and changes in coverage over time to identify a bank-lending channel in Poland. Banks with partial guarantees have a stronger loan response to monetary policy than banks with full guarantees. Furthermore, the weak response of the fully guaranteed banks is attributed to their ability to raise low-reserve, uninsured time deposits relative to the partially covered banks. When differential coverage is eliminated, there is no disparity in the loan response between the two groups. This lending channel has implications for credit control and financial system development in emerging markets. (JEL E52, G21, G28)

TI  - Is Monetary Policy Less Effective When Interest Rates are Persistently Low?
AU  - Borio, Claudio E. V.
AU  - Hofmann, Boris
AB  - Is monetary policy less effective in boosting aggregate demand and output during periods of persistently low interest rates? This paper reviews the reasons why this might be the case and the corresponding empirical evidence. Transmission could be weaker for two main reasons: (i) headwinds, which would typically arise in the wake of balance sheet recessions, when interest rates are low; and (ii) inherent non-linearities, which would kick in when interest rates are persistently low and would dampen their impact on spending. Our review of the evidence suggests that headwinds during the recovery from balance-sheet recessions tend to reduce monetary policy effectiveness. At the same time, there is also evidence of inherent non-linearities. That said, disentangling the two types of effect is very hard, not least given the limited extant work on this issue. In addition, there appears to be an independent role for nominal rates in the transmission process, regardless of the level of real (inflation-adjusted) rates.
