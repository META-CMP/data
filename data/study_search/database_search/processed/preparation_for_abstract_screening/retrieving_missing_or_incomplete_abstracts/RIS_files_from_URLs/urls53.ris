AB  - On using monetary policy for macro-economic regulation, after the 1930s Great Depression when effective demand insufficiency emerges, Keynesianism proposes that proactive fiscal and easy monetary policies shall be introduced. His proposal is later adopted in Roosevelt's New Deal, which greatly help USA climb out of economy recession and achieve prosperity over 20 years.

AU  - Kim, Jihae

T2  - Emerging Markets Finance and Trade
AB  - The effects of monetary policy shocks on farm prices and exchange rates in Korea are empirically investigated by using vector auto-regression models with sign restrictions on impulse responses. The main empirical results are as follows. First, (contractionary) monetary policy shocks have significantly negative effects on real farm prices. Second, the SR effect on farm prices is significant but short-lived. The dynamic response of farm prices is consistent with the predictions of the “overshooting” model. Third, the effects of monetary policy shocks on farm prices are more significant than the effects of monetary policy shocks on exchange rates.

T2  - The Economic Journal
AB  - The UK’s monetary policy strategy is one of floating exchange rates and inflation forecast targeting, with the targeted measure referring to consumer prices. We consider whether it is welfare‐reducing to target inflation in the CPI rather than in a narrower index and the role of the exchange rate in the transmission of monetary policy actions to CPI inflation. It is appropriate to model imports as intermediate goods rather than goods consumed directly by households. This leads to a simpler transmission mechanism of monetary policy while also offering a sustainable explanation of the weakness of the exchange rate/inflation relationship and making consumer price inflation an appropriate monetary policy target.

TI  - Monetary Policy when the Phillips Curve is Quite Flat

AB  - This paper highlights how the presence of a cost channel of monetary policy can oﬀer new insights into the relation between monetary policy and inﬂation when the Phillips curve is quite ﬂat. For instance, we highlight a key condition whereby lax monetary policy can push the economy in a low inﬂation trap and we discuss how, under the same condition, standard policy rules for targeting inﬂation may need to be modiﬁed. In the empirical part of the paper we explore the relevance of the conditions that give rise to these observations. To this end, we present both (i) a wide set of estimates derived from single-equation estimation of the US Phillips curve and (ii) estimates based on structural estimation of a full model. The results from both sets of empirical exercises strongly support the key condition we emphasize.

AB  - In this paper we investigate whether the reaction function of the National Bank of Poland (NBP) is asymmetric according to the level of inflation gap and the level of output gap. Moreover, we test whether these asymmetries might possibly stem from nonlinearities in the Phillips curve. Threshold models are applied and two cases of unknown and known threshold values are investigated. Our results show that the Polish central bank responds more strongly to the level inflation when the level of inflation is relatively high. We find very weak evidence that the level of inflation reacts more strongly to the output gap when the output gap is relatively high. Thus, the asymmetries in the monetary policy rule seem to indicate asymmetric preferences of the central bank.

The resulting policy rule is then empirically examined using quarterly data with regard to Canada and the UK from 1983q1 to 2007q4. Our empirical investigation shows that the open economy policy rule receives support from the data and that the monetary policy makers in the UK and Canada have asymmetric preferences. Robustness checks based on model calibration provide support for the suggested policy rule. Copyright © 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

TI  - The effectiveness of monetary policy in small open economies
AU  - Primus, Keyra
T2  - Journal of Policy Modeling
AB  - This paper examines the relative effectiveness of the use of direct and indirect monetary policy instruments in Barbados, Jamaica and Trinidad and Tobago, by estimating a restricted Vector Autoregressive model with Exogenous Variables (VARX). The model captures the dynamic interaction of the key sectors in the economy and it accounts for the fact that the banking system in those countries is characterized by high levels of excess reserves. Also, the study assumes that the central bank conducts monetary policy using a Taylor-type rule, and it evaluates the effects of a reserve requirement policy. The results show that although a positive shock to the policy interest rate has a direct effect on commercial banks’ interest rates, there is a weak transmission to the real variables. Furthermore, an increase in the required reserve ratio is successful in reducing private sector credit and excess reserves, while at the same time alleviating pressures on the exchange rate. The findings therefore indicate that central banks in small open economies should consider using reserve requirements as a complement to interest rate policy, to achieve their macroeconomic objectives.

AB  - Can the structure of asset markets change the way monetary policy should be conducted? Following a linear-quadratic approach, the present paper addresses this question in a New Keynesian small open economy framework. Our results reveal that the configuration of asset markets significantly affects optimal monetary policy and the performance of standard policy rules. In particular, when comparing complete and incomplete markets, the ranking of policy rules is entirely reversed, and so are the policy prescriptions regarding the optimal level of exchange rate volatility.

AB  - Measuring Monetary Policy in Open Economies* The empirical VAR literature on the monetary transmission mechanism in open economies has not yet provided a commonly accepted solution to the problem of simultaneity between interest rates and the exchange rate. In this paper we propose to solve the identification problem by using information extracted from financial markets independently from the VAR to measure monetary policy shocks. We also evaluate the relative importance of macroeconomic and monetary policy variables in explaining short-term fluctuations in the nominal exchange rate. Our main results are that the simultaneity between German policy rates and the US dollar/Deutsche mark exchange rate is not an empirically relevant problem and that monetary variables are dominated by macroeconomic factors in the explanation of exchange rate fluctuations.

AB  - Although optimal monetary policy stabilizes food inflation theoretically, empirical studies remain limited not only in the context of volumes and the estimation approaches, but are focused on selected advanced and emerging countries to the neglect of Africa where poverty and dominance of food in the consumption basket are more pronounced. We provide empirical evidence in the context of South Africa using quantile regressions. Rising food prices are destabilized even further by restrictive monetary policy; a finding that has ramifications for inflation targeting, especially given that a quarter of the country’s population is food poor.

AB  - This research investigates the interrelationship between the main macroeconomic indicators of an oil exporting country and world oil prices using a vector autoregressive (VAR) approach. We focus on an economy, which is a non-OPEC oil exporter and its oil revenues account for a significant proportion of the country's total export and budget revenues. We explain the oil price transition mechanisms to this economy from the export side and through the fiscal channel taking into account the monetary policy factor. The results suggest that oil price fluctuations have a significant impact on the oil exporting country's real GDP, CPI inflation rate, interest rate, and exchange rate. Moreover, to estimate monetary policy rule for this energy exporter, we test the Taylor equation and associated Taylor rule, including the oil prices gap, since the latter may have a significant impact on the key policy rate. The evidence suggests that the Taylor rule describes the post-financial crisis monetary policy of this economy relatively well. Finally, we discuss future research and lessons from this economy for monetary policy makers.

AU  - Alba, Joseph D.

AU  - Park, Donghyun
AB  - Adverse foreign output shocks have a sizable impact on the welfare of small open economies. Therefore, one of the key roles of monetary policy in those economies is to minimize the welfare losses arising from such shocks. To assess the welfare impact of external shocks under different monetary policy regimes, we numerically solve and calculate the welfare loss function of a dynamic stochastic general equilibrium model with complete exchange rate pass through. We find that consumer price index (CPI) inflation targeting minimizes welfare losses for import-to-gross domestic product (GDP) ratios from 0.3 to 0.9. However, welfare under the pegged exchange rate regime is almost equivalent to CPI inflation targeting when the import-to-GDP ratio is 1, while the domestic inflation targeting minimizes welfare when the import-to-GDP ratio is 0.1. We calibrate the model and derive welfare implications for eight East Asian small open economies.

AB  - This paper provides a systematic empirical analysis of the role of the housing market in the macroeconomy in the US and the euro area. First, it establishes some stylised facts concerning key variables in the housing market on the two sides of the Atlantic, such as real house prices, residential investment and mortgage debt. It then presents evidence from Structural Vector Autoregressions (SVAR) by focusing on the effects of monetary policy, credit supply and housing demand shocks on the housing market and the broader economy. The analysis shows that similarities outweigh differences as far as the housing market is concerned. The empirical evidence suggests a stronger role for housing in the transmission of monetary policy shocks in the US. The evidence is less clear-cut for housing demand shocks. Finally, credit supply shocks seem to matter more in the euro area.

AU  - Vega, Marco
AB  - This paper models an emerging economy with ﬁnancial dollarization features within an optimizing, stochastic general equilibrium setup. One key result in this framework is that unexpected nominal exchange rate depreciations are positively correlated with the probability of default by borrower ﬁrms and turn out to be a powerful mechanism to aﬀect aggregate consumption. Throughout the monetary policy evaluation exercises performed, the sign of the unexpected depreciation is positively correlated to the real value of assets and negatively correlated to aggregate consumption. This result supports the idea that unexpected exchange rate depreciations are contractionary and not expansionary if dollarization and agency costs in the ﬁnancial sector are considered.

T2  - Journal of Money, Credit and Banking
AB  - This paper evaluates under which conditions different Taylor-type rules lead to determinacy and expectational stability (E-stability) of rational expectations equilibrium in a simple “New Keynesian” small open economy model, developed by Gali and Monacelli (2005). In particular, we extend Bullard and Mitra (2002) results of determinacy and E-stability in a closed economy to this small open economy framework. Our results highlight an important link between the Taylor principle and both determinacy and learnability of equilibrium in small open economies. More importantly, the degree of openness coupled with the nature of the policy rule adopted by the monetary authorities might change this link in important ways. A key finding is that, contrary to Bullard and Mitra, expectations-based rules that involve the consumer price inflation and/or the nominal exchange rate limit the region of E-stability and the Taylor Principle does not guarantee E-stability. We also show that some forms of managed exchange rate rules can help to alleviate problems of both indeterminacy and expectational instability, yet these rules might not be desirable since they can promote greater volatility in the economy.

T2  - Asian Economic and Financial Review
AB  - This paper investigates the transmission mechanism of unconventional monetary policies by estimating a time-varying parameter structural vector auto-regression (TVP-VAR) model using Japanese monthly data beginning with the implementation of quantitative easing in 2001. The results of the empirical study can be summarized in four points. First, the accumulated impulse responses of stock prices and exchange rates to a positive monetary policy shock are significant increases and significant depreciation, respectively, in the early days of all unconventional monetary policy periods. Second, a monetary policy shock does not increase bank lending for all unconventional monetary policies. Third, the relationship between an increase in stock prices and the depreciation of exchange rates and increase in GDP has changed since the beginning of Abenomics. Fourth, the accumulated impulse responses of the inflation rate to a positive monetary policy shock became a significant increase during and after the comprehensive monetary easing in October 2010 due to the clarification of the policy duration, and the responses become remarkable after inflation targeting was introduced in January 2013. The first and second results imply that the main transmission channel of unconventional monetary policy in Japan is stock prices and the exchange rate.

AB  - In the context of sovereign debt crisis in Europe, a crisis entirely felt also in the direct relation between credit institutions, the National Bank of Romania (NBR) adopted a monetary policy strategy meant to determine the reinforcement of its image, by initiating in the autumn of 2011 a new series of reduction of the monetary policy interest rate and implicitly the appropriate resizing of liquidity conditions. By increasing the role of liquidity adjustment, the European Central Bank (ECB) succeeded to determine in the money market the decrease of interbank rate interests under the interest rate level of monetary policy. The direct inflation targeting strategy used by the European Central Bank in applying its monetary policy has the first criterion of implementation the expression of inflation target in terms of „headline inflation” (consumer price index - CPI) given that the economic market in Romania is familiar with this indicator. Also, the main criterion considered by the investment segment of the market to achieve capital infusions in economic transactions is represented by the consumer price index, this one ensuring the necessary transparency related to the effects of inflation phenomenon. A strong argument supporting the use of consumer price index in monetary policy is represented by its upward flexibility towards the limited effectiveness of monetary aggregates in sizing inflationary anticipations. The downward slope of inflation phenomenon, in whose depreciation the evolution of consumer price index, whose positive trend surprised the European Central Bank, played a significant role, determined adjustments in the monetary policy strategy of the National Bank of Romania and at the same time the achievement of the inflationary target proposed with a direct effect on the monetary policy interest rate. The same measure to reduce the key interest rate is outlined in the monetary policy of the European Central Bank and it is mainly due to the decrease of inflation phenomenon, although at the end of 2011 important quantities of liquidities were introduced in the financial system. It remains to be analysed to what extent the inflation phenomenon will be possible to manage under the conditions of the renewal of economic instability in the euro area and to which direction this aspect will influence the monetary policy of the National Bank of Romania.

AB  - This research investigates the interrelationship between the Russian Federation’s main macroeconomic indicators, monetary policy and world oil prices using a vector autoregressive approach and monthly time-series data from January 1993 to December 2016. We selected the Russian Federation for this analysis because it is one of the largest oil exporting countries that is not a member of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, and its oil revenues account for a significant proportion of the country’s total export and budget revenues. We assume that oil prices are exogenously given to this country, despite being a large oil-exporter, and explain the oil price transition mechanisms to the Russian Federation’s economy from the export side and through the fiscal channel taking into account the monetary policy factor. The results suggest that the impact of the oil price fluctuations on the country’s gross domestic product, consumer price index inflation rate, interest rate, and exchange rate was more significant between 2000 and 2016 than between 1993 and 1999. To estimate the monetary policy rule for the Russian Federation, we test the modified Taylor equation and associated Taylor rule, including the oil price gap, since the latter may have a significant impact on the key policy rate. The evidence suggests that the Taylor rule describes the post-financial crisis monetary policy of the Russian Federation relatively well.

AB  - A structural vector autoregressive model is employed to investigate the impact of monetary policy and real exchange rate shocks on the stock market performance of Kuwait, Oman, Saudi Arabia, Egypt and Jordan. In order to identify the structural shocks both short run and long run restrictions are applied. Unlike previous literature the contemporaneous interdependence between the financial variables is left unrestricted to give a more accurate depiction of the relationships. The heterogeneity of the results reflects the different monetary policy frameworks and stock market characteristics of these countries. Mainly, monetary policy and the real exchange rate shocks have a significant short run impact on the stock prices of the countries that apply a relatively more independent monetary policy and flexible exchange rates.

AB  - This paper empirically investigates The Effects of monetary policy shocks on foreign exchange rates in Nigeria and South Africa using VAR procedures for the time series data which spanned the period 2005-2017. In order to achieve the objectives of the study, some selected components of monetary policy instruments and foreign exchange rates variables for Nigeria and South Africa were utilized. The results from the VAR method revealed that monetary policy shocks impacted on the variability for both countries' domestic exchange rates against the foreign currencies, nevertheless, these movements are inconsistent with theory. The empirical results further indicated that, especially for Nigeria, exchange rates movements are at variance with the expected outcome. Therefore, domestic currency depreciation is more likely to be experienced rather than appreciation in an economy where monetary policy contraction is embraced.

AU  - Warnock, Francis E.
T2  - Journal of International Money and Finance
AB  - International spillovers and exchange rate dynamics are examined in a two-country dynamic optimizing model that nests Obstfeld and Rogoff (1995) and allows for home-product bias in consumption patterns. Allowing for home bias changes the results in three ways. Wealth transfers associated with net foreign asset positions induce movements in the real exchange rate and produce large short-run and small long-run deviations from consumption-based purchasing power parity. Interest rates, both real and nominal, can differ across countries; home bias is a necessary but not sufficient condition for Dornbusch (1976) type exchange rate overshooting. And the welfare effects of monetary policy depend not only on world demand but also on the expenditure-switching effect of an exchange rate depreciation; expansionary monetary policy is ‘beggar-thy-neighbor’ if individuals have strong preferences for domestic goods.

AB  - In this paper we assess the role of asset prices as information variables for aggregate demand conditions and in the transmission of monetary policy. A Monetary Conditions Index, a weighted average of the short-term interest rate and the exchange rate, has commonly been used as a composite measure of the stance of monetary policy and aggregate demand conditions. However, other asset prices, property and share prices, also affect aggregate demand. By looking at reduced form coefficient estimates and VAR impulse responses we derive Financial Conditions Indices, a weighted average of the short-term real interest rate, the effective real exchange rate, real property and real share prices, for the G7 countries. We find that house and share prices get a substantial weight in such an index and that the derived Financial Conditions Indices contain useful information about future inflationary pressures.

AB  - In a dynamic New Keynesian optimizing model, we introduce incomplete exchange rate pass-through on import prices. Three results stand out. First, unlike canonical models with perfect pass-through which emphasize a type of isomorphism, incomplete pass-through renders the analysis of monetary policy of an open economy fundamentally different from the one of a closed economy. Second, productivity-driven deviations from the law of one price assume the interpretation of endogenous cost-push shocks. Third, the optimal commitment policy, relative to discretion, entails a smoothing of the deviations from the law of one price and requires more stable nominal and real exchange rates.

TI  - Disaggregated Short-Term Inflation Forecast (STIF) for Monetary Policy Decision in Sierra Leone
AU  - Jackson, Emerson Abraham
AU  - Tamuke, Edmund
AU  - Jabbie, Mohamed
AB  - In this paper, the researchers have developed a short term inflation forecasting (STIF) model using Box-Jenkins time series approach (ARIMA) for analysing inflation and associated risks in Sierra Leone. The model is aided with fan charts for all thirteen components, including the Headline CPI as communication tools to inform the general public about uncertainties that surround price dynamics in Sierra Leone – this then make it possible for policy makers to utilise expert judgments in a bid to stabilize the economy. The uniqueness of this paper is its interpretation of risks to each of the disaggregated components, while also improving credibility of decisions taken by policy makers at the Bank of Sierra Leone [BSL]. Empirically, Food and Non-Alcoholic Beverages, Housing and Health components indicate that shock arising from within or outside of Sierra Leone can significantly impact headline CPI, with immediate pass-through effect of high prices on consumers’ spending, at least in the short-run. The outcome of this empirical research shows uniqueness of the disaggregated model in tailoring policy makers’ attention towards targeting sector-specific policy interventions. Fan Charts produced have also highlighted degree of risks, which is based on confidence bands, which shows deviation from the baseline forecast. The ultimate goal is to improve sectoral productive capacity, while at the same time, monitoring price volatility spill-over through empirical disaggregation of the CPI basket – in association with this, outcome from the study also shows that the use of multivariate models like VAR would be welcome to monitor events on price dynamics in the national economy.

AB  - The paper considers alternative monetary policy regimes within a calibrated macroeconomic model with a traded and a non-traded sector. Two classes of regimes are considered: inflation targeting and exchange rate targeting. When the target variable is completely stabilized, both rules have poor stabilizing properties for all real variables--nominal exchange rate targeting is even dynamically unstable. When the monetary authority places some weight on output stabilization in addition to the primary target variable, inflation targeting outperforms exchange rate targeting in terms of output stability in both the traded and the non-traded sectors.

T2  - International Economics and Economic Policy
AB  - This paper provides an empirical examination on the transmission mechanisms of conventional and unconventional monetary policies for two non-EMU countries, Switzerland and the United Kingdom, over the period 1990–2017. We investigate the role of stock prices and consumer expectations in the transmission of monetary policy. We propose two distinct structural VAR models. The model for the case of conventional monetary policy covers the pre-2009 period, while the model for the case of unconventional monetary policy covers the post-2009 period. The official bank policy rate and central bank’s reserve assets are used as instruments for conventional and unconventional monetary policy. The analysis reveals that the inclusion of a forward-looking informational variable of near-term development in economic activity and a financial variable such as the stock prices is of key importance for the monetary policy assessment. We provide evidence for the existence of a consumer confidence channel in the transmission of conventional monetary policy. Moreover, the long-term government bond yields, the exchange rate and stock prices have an important role in the transmission of unconventional monetary policy. Our findings indicate that conventional and unconventional monetary policies have short-run expansionary effects in both countries by increasing output, consumption, investment, stock prices and wages, while reducing unemployment.

AB  - In this paper, we investigate the effects of monetary policy concerning the inflation rates specific for each income group of households. We find that the prices specific for high-income households are generally more rigid and less volatile compared to the prices specific for middle and lower-income households. This means that monetary policy can differently affect the different inflation rates specific for each of the income groups. By using a Factor-Augmented VAR (FAVAR) model, we show that a monetary policy shock affects high-income households less compared to middle and lower-income households, although the differences between the separate income groups are generally small. Then, by using a small scale gap model, we find that the prices of low-income households are the most sensitive to a monetary policy shock, while the prices of the top-income households are the least sensitive to the shock, which is in line with our empirical findings.

T2  - Journal of Economic Perspectives
AB  - At central banks around the world, including the Bank of England, Sweden's Riksbank, Norway's Norges Bank, and the Reserve Bank of New Zealand, policy is conducted on the basis of "inflation-forecast targeting": the central bank constructs quantitative projections of the economy's expected future evolution based on the way in which it intends to control short-term interest rates, and public discussion of those projections plays a critical role in justifying the banks' conduct of monetary policy to the public. What accounts for the appeal of this approach? Should it be adopted more widely or more explicitly? I review the long-running debate between proponents of monetary rules and proponents of discretionary monetary policy and argue that inflation-forecast targeting represents a powerful synthesis of the two approaches. I explore some common questions that arise about inflation-forecast targeting and consider how the U.S. Federal Reserve might move toward an explicit policy of inflation-forecast targeting.

Однако величина данного эффекта оказывается очень ограниченной. Анализ факторов региональной неоднородности показывает, что чем выше доля добывающих отраслей в ВРП, доля кредитов, выданных предприятиям, связанным с обрабатывающим сектором, доля кредитов, выданных малым предприятиям региона, а также региональный уровень безработицы, тем сильнее базовая инфляция региона реагирует на шок ДКП. Степень неоднородности отклика базовой инфляции регионов России на шок ДКП, набор факторов для объяснения данной неоднородности, а также объясненная часть дисперсии регионального отклика (30-40% в зависимости от спецификации модели) оказались сопоставимыми с аналогичными показателями в других странах, имеющих выраженную региональную неоднородность.

Unlike previous literature, to answer these questions, we measure cycle movements by calculating an index from a number of aggregate macroeconomic series via a dynamic factor model. We ﬁnd that monetary policy shocks have a small but signiﬁcant impact on persistent and transitory parts of the cycle. A systematic shift of monetary policy has a modest eﬀect.

This paper empirically investigates effects of monetary policy shocks on Sri Lankan economy with particular focus on the strength of credit and exchange rate channels using a VAR model for 2003–2019 period. We find that: (i) monetary policy shocks have a significant and persistent impact on key macroeconomic variables even though several puzzling results emerge; (ii) the effects of monetary policy shocks are significant and more persistent in the post-conflict period than in the conflict period; (iii) a tight monetary policy effectively contains inflation in the post-conflict period; and (iv) interest rate and exchange rate channels play a dominant role while the credit channel responds with some lags in the post-conflict period.

AB  - Using the structural vector autoregressive methodology, we present estimates of monetary transmission for the new and future EU member countries in Central and Eastern Europe. Unlike most previous research we include ten transition countries. We examine to what extent monetary transmission in these countries is related to financial structure indicators, using an approach similar to that used by Cecchetti [Cecchetti, Stephen G., 1999. Legal structure, financial structure, and the monetary policy transmission mechanism. Federal Reserve Bank of New York Economic Policy Review 5 (2), 9–28] to investigate this issue for eleven old EU member countries. Unlike Cecchetti's results for the old EU member countries, we find little evidence of any link between financial structure indicators and monetary policy for these ten accession countries.

AU  - Holtemöller, Oliver
AB  - In this paper, the empirical relevance of the credit channel for the explanation of monetary policy transmission in Germany during the period of monetary targeting from 1975 to 1998 is analyzed. While existing studies of the credit channel rely mostly on the analysis of monetary policy effects on balance sheet items, both quantities and financing costs are considered here. Using vector autoregressive models, impulse response analysis and forecast error variance decompositions, strong empirical evidence for the effectiveness and relevance of a credit channel in Germany can be reported.

AB  - In any period of time and economic condition, specific monetary and fiscal policies are used. Hence the influence of monetary policy depending on the adopted monetary instruments, is different. But the important issue is the impact of monetary policy on other parts of the economy. One of the foeffective factor monetary policy is exchange rate. The aim of this study is to examine the relevance and effectiveness of monetary policy on exchange rates using annual time series of 1989-2007 and auto regressive distributed lag method (ARDL). The results of this study indicated that the effect of monetary policy on exchange rates is positive and significant in the long term. National income have a significant negative impact on exchange rates. While the impact of unstable fluctuations of exchange rates and consumer price index on the exchange rate are not significant. In short term, monetary policy after one lag period and unst exchange rates. Unstable flactuation of exchange rate have significantly positive effect on exchange rates, while national income and consumer price index have significantly negative effect on exchange rates.

AB  - The purpose of this paper is to examine non-linear and cointegrating relationships between monetary policy uncertainty, investor sentiment, and stock market for the US economy, via controlling for potential macroeconomic risk factors. We mainly utilize non-linear autoregressive distributed lag (NARDL) approach and findings support an existing cointegration between the aforementioned variables. Our results also suggest that there is a bidirectional and negative relationship between US stock market performance and monetary policy uncertainty in the short-run. Furthermore, the effect of monetary policy uncertainty on investor sentiment is significantly negative and not strongly asymmetric in the long-run. On the other hand, in the short-run, increasing investor sensitivity to macroeconomic shocks strongly increases monetary policy uncertainty, while reducing sensitivity does not have a significant impact on the monetary policy uncertainty. Finally, we find a positive and bi-directional relationship between stock prices and investor sentiment both in the short- and long-run. In the long-run, decreasing investor sensitivity to macroeconomic fluctuations (becoming more optimistic) has a greater positive influence on stock prices than a negative influence on stock prices, since investors are becoming more pessimistic. Implications from our analysis are important to policy makers and investors for determining effective economic policy decisions and proper investment strategies.

AB  - This paper demonstrates that increased international monetary cooperation may actually be counterproductive. The potential problem is that cooperation between central banks may exacerbate the credibility problem of central banks vis-à-vis the private sector. Coordinated monetary expansion yields a better output/inflation trade-off than unilateral expansion because it does not induce exchange rate depreciation. Wage setters realize that the incentives to inflate are greater in a cooperative regime, and thus time-consistent nominal wage rates are higher. Cooperation does improve responses to disturbances. Thus, a cooperative regime which contains institutional constraints on systematic inflation is definitely superior.

T2  - Acta Universitatis Danubius. Œconomica
AB  - The aim of this study is to assess if monetary policy variables exert any sufficient effect on stock market development in Nigeria, for the time frame 1986-2015. By adopting the Johansen cointegration and error correction method (ECM) of analysis; it was found that long-term association prevails amongst monetary policy variables, and stock market development variables used in the study for Nigeria. However, going by the short-run result, this study submits that monetary policy has not significantly impacted on stock market development. This is because key monetary variables such as lending rate, deposit rate, and Treasury bills issued, do not show any sufficient effect on stock market development; either in the current or previous periods. Thus, implying that monetary policy in Nigeria should be geared towards repositioning the activities of the stock market in Nigeria, to bring about the desired growth and development in the economy.

AB  - Do labor market reforms initiated in periods of loose monetary policy yield different outcomes from those that were introduced in periods when monetary tightening prevailed? The answer to this question is a firm, yes. We document the vital role of accommodative monetary policy for an increase in unemployment benefits, spending on active labor market policies, and labor market deregulation to boost growth and reduce unemployment. It was found that if interest rates cannot be reduced, then unemployment benefits should be lowered. A more rigid labor market, it was further found, can deliver expansionary effects, especially during the crisis period.

AU  - Turay, Alhassan

T2  - African Journal of Economic and Management Studies
AB  - Purpose The degree of responsiveness of fiscal and monetary policy mechanisms that promote growth and development in Sierra Leone is the subject of this article. Design/methodology/approach This article uses both the Auto Regressive Distributed Lag (ARDL) model presented by Hashem and Yongcheol (1998) and the Non-Linear Auto Regressive Distributed Lag (NARDL) model by Shin et al. (2014) to analyze annual time-series data in evaluating the asymmetric effect of real gross domestic product (RGDP), inflation, government expenditure and money supply using annual time-series data for 40 observations over the period 1980–2019. Findings The augmented Dickey–Fuller unit root test shows that money supply, government spending and consumer price index are integrated at first difference I (1), while RGDP is stationary at level I (0). The results of the NARDL cointegration test indicate that the variables are cointegrated. The study shows that government expenditure is a positive function of both positive and negative changes. Hence, both positive and negative cumulative sum government expenditures improve economic growth but show a relative weak asymmetric effect with the regressand. This study also reveals that inflation is a negative function of both positive and negative changes with asymmetric effect with the dependent variable. This study shows that the positive change of money supply is statistically insignificant in boosting economic growth, while the negative change positively improves economic growth. Conclusively, this article shows that fiscal policy has a greater and more responsive than monetary policy in promoting growth and development in Sierra Leone. The result of the error correction term of the NARDL model shows a high spend of adjustment of 135% from any disequilibrium of GDP imbalance in the economy. Originality/value To address the problem of fiscal dominance in Sierra Leone, this study recommends that fiscal and monetary policies should be coordinated simultaneously and to an appropriate extent to achieve the desired outcome in growth and development.

TI  - Oil price shocks, monetary policy and current account imbalances within a currency union
AU  - Belke, Ansgar
AU  - Baas, Timo
T2  - ROME Working Papers
AB  - For more than two decades now, current-account imbalances are a crucial issue in the international policy debate as they threaten the stability of the world economy. More recently, the government debt crisis of the European Union shows that internal current account imbalances inside a currency union may also add to these risks. Oil price fluctuations and a contracting monetary policy that reacts on oil prices, previously discussed to affect the current account may also be a threat to the currency union by changing internal imbalances. Therefore, in this paper, we analyze the impact of oil price shocks on current account imbalances within a currency union. Differences in institutions, especially labor market institutions and trade result in an asymmetric reaction to an otherwise symmetric shock. In this context, we show that oil price shocks can have a long-lasting impact on internal balances, as the exchange rate adjustment mechanism is not available. The common monetary policy authority, however, can reduce such effects by specifying an optimum monetary policy target. Nevertheless, we also show that there is no single best solution. CPI, core CPI or an asymmetric CPI target all come at a cost either regarding an increase in unemployment or increasing imbalances.

TI  - Financial Sector Reforms and Monetary Policy in Zambia
AU  - Simatele, Munacinga
AB  - The dissertation comprises four chapters focusing on issues concerning policy reforms and monetary policy in Zambia. 

Chapter 1 briefly outlines the theoretical foundations for the reforms undertaken in Zambia since the mid 1980s and the process thereof. The main issues addressed were the removal of interest rate and credit controls, exchange rate devaluation and the use of indirect instruments in implementing monetary policy. The review indicates that although the control of inflation is still difficult and figures are still in double digit levels, annual inflation rates have reduced significantly compared to levels achieved in the early 1990s. The nominal exchange rate has been depreciating prompting increased intervention from the central bank. Despite the increase in nominal interest rates, real deposit rates have remained negative.

Chapter two analyses the monetary transmission mechanism in Zambia. Vector auto -regressions are estimated for the pre-reform and post-reform periods.Variance decompositions and impulse response functions are examined to see whether there are any changes observed in the monetary transmission mechanism after the reforms. Different systems are estimated in each period using alternate variables as measures of monetary policy shocks. The results show that contractionary monetary policy is followed by a fall in both output and prices. When compared, results from the two estimation periods show that both the responsiveness of prices and output to policy shocks and the magnitude of their forecast error variance decompositions explained by these variables have increased since the reforms. The results also show that the impact lags have reduced. There is evidence of the bank lending channel both before and
after the reforms. Of the mechanisms estimated, the exchange rate mechanism seems to be the most important mechanism for transmission of policy shocks to both prices and output during the post-reform period.

Chapter three investigates whether monetary aggregates have useful information for predicting inflation other than that provided by inflation itself. Forecasting experiments are conducted to see whether monetary aggregates and selected financial sector variables are useful in predicting inflation.We perform forecasting experiments and compare the performance of different models. We also estimate an error correction model of inflation. Of the monetary aggregates considered, M2 contains the most information and its growth rate is significant in the inflation model. The external sector variables are also important. The results indicate that inflation exhibits a high level of inertia suggesting the presence of implicit indexation and significant inflationary expectations possibly due to past fiscal effects and low policy credibility. Overall, the foreign sector variables seem to be more important for movements in prices than monetary aggregates even in the long run.

The importance of the exchange rate to stabilisation policy in Zambia is underscored by the results obtained in chapters 2 and 3. In this paper, we pursue this idea by investigating the effect of central bank intervention on exchange rates in Zambia. Using a GARCH (1, 1) model of the exchange rate, we simultaneously estimate the effect of cumulative intervention on the mean and variance of the exchange rate.We find that central bank intervention in the foreign exchange market increases the mean but reduces the variance of the exchange rate. The explanation leans towards speculative bandwagons and a 'leaning against the wind' strategy. Although there is no attempt to distinguish through which channel intervention operates, we argue that this is more likely to be a signalling effect rather than a portfolio balance effect. This effect operates mainly through the supply and demand of foreign exchange in the market.

TI  - The Effectiveness of Monetary Policy in Small Open Economies: An Empirical Investigation
AU  - Primus, Keyra
AB  - This paper examines the relative effectiveness of the use of indirect and direct monetary policy instruments in Barbados, Jamaica and Trinidad and Tobago, by estimating a restricted Vector Autoregressive model with Exogenous Variables (VARX). The study assumes that the central bank conducts monetary policy using a Taylor-type rule and it evaluates the effects of a reserve requirement policy. The results show that although a positive shock to the policy interest rate has a direct effect on commercial banks' interest rates, there is a weak transmission to the real variables. Furthermore, an increase in the required reserve ratio is successful in reducing private sector credit and excess reserves, while at the same time alleviating pressures on the exchange rate. The findings therefore indicate that central banks in small open economies should consider using reserve requirements as a complement to interest rate policy, to achieve their macroeconomic objectives.

TI  - The Impact of Monetary Policy on CPI and GDP in the Czech Republic and Switzerland for the Period 2000-2016
AU  - Černohorská, Liběna
AB  - The aim of this paper is to compare the effectiveness of the monetary policy implemented at the time of low interest rates and foreign exchange interventions in the Czech Republic and Switzerland (using the monetary aggregate M3 and its impact on CPI and GDP). The followed relationship between these values is analyzed using the Engle-Granger cointegration test. These tests are conducted on select statistical data from the years 2000 to 2016. The input data are quarterly in nature and have been seasonally adjusted. For determining the cointegration relationship, it is possible to proceed with the Engle-Granger test, which is meant to determine the long-term relationship between the effectiveness of the monetary policy – between the monetary aggregates M3 and GDP and the relationship between M3 and CPI in the Czech Republic and Switzerland. On the basis of these tests, it was found that there is no cointegration relationship between any time series at a level of significance of 0.05; this means that no long-term relationship was found between the M3 and GDP and also for M3 and CPI. Not finding long-term relationships between M3 and CPI, respectively GDP, means that the monetary policy in the Czech Republic and Switzerland was in the period 2000-2016 ineffective.

T2  - Journal of Economic Policy Reform
AB  - We evaluate the income distributional effect of monetary policy in the UK for the period 1993–2019 using a mixed frequency approach and a high-frequency identification. Our results indicate that expansionary monetary policy increased income inequality during the unconventional policy subperiod 2009–2019. Looking at the income brackets, we find that this increase in inequality is primarily due to the positive impact of expansionary policy on the upper share of income distribution. Our counterfactual analysis reveals that unconventional monetary policy contributed to the increase in inequality and that the response to COVID-19 is likely to do the same.

A2  - Tokic, Damir
AB  - This study analyzes the sensitivity of a series of Indian stock indices for the astonishing component of monetary and macroeconomic policy with the data set from 1 April 2004 to 31 July 2016. The immediate impact is assessed with event analysis, and the dynamic effect is analyzed with the Vector Autoregression (VAR) model. The result of the event analysis indicates that the monetary policy surprise significantly affects the stock market and is more prominent than that of other macroeconomic surprises. Unlike the event study, the VAR analysis found that the other macroeconomic surprise also affects stock return. The study also highlights the industry effect and size effect, which is coherent with the predictions of the CAPM (Capital Asset Pricing Model) model. While many studies have been conducted on the monetary policy surprise in the developed economy, there are relatively few studies on macroeconomic surprises. Some studies conducted in India have analyzed the impact of monetary policy surprises on stock price; however, to the best of our knowledge, none of the studies has examined the simultaneous effect of both macroeconomic and monetary policy surprise. The study is relevant because the responses differ across sectors and vary with firm sizes. Thus, the study can effectively be used as a hedging instrument. Furthermore, the stock market acts as a vital channel for policy transmission and a critical decision driver for corporate finance. The understanding of firm and stock market dynamics against macroeconomic surprises can help policymakers in enhancing policy effectiveness and corporate finance professionals in improving decision-making.

AB  - A critical question for emerging-market policymakers is how to adjust to monetary policy changes in the center. A core tenet of modern macroeconomic theory is that countries should let their exchange rate float when financial conditions abroad change. This allows the nominal and real exchange rates to absorb the brunt of the required adjustment. This is the standard Mundell-Fleming prescription for floating exchange rates. Accordingly when the U.S. Federal Reserve tightens its policy a country like Chile should let its currency depreciate. Under. the standard analysis the Fed tightening slows down economic activity in the U.S. thus depressing the demand for Chilean exports. The depreciation of the peso offsets partly or even fully this negative impulse thus helping to prop up the Chilean economy.

AU  - Ikhide, Sylvanus

T2  - Journal of Economic Integration
AB  - The countries in the Common Monetary Area (CMA), South Africa, Lesotho, Namibia and Swaziland, have harmonised their monetary and exchange rate policies in a quasi-monetary union since 1990. Lesotho, Namibia and Swaziland (LNS) have pegged their currencies to the South African Rand thus effectively surrendering monetary policy to the South African reserve bank. The arrangement has resulted in benefits in the form of lower prices, economy on trading costs, and a large increase in trade volume and cross-border financial transactions. However, one cost that has confronted the LNS economies in this monetary arrangement is the loss of independent monetary policy decision-making for stabilisation purposes. This study applies VAR to trace the impact of South Africa Reserve Bank°Øs (SARB) monetary policy on the LNS economies. Specifically, the study examines how a change in the policy instrument of the Reserve Bank of South Africa affects money, credit and level of prices in the LNS economies and consequently assesses the capability of these economies to undertake independent monetary policy. Both the impulse response functions and the cumulated forecast errors show that the lending rates, level of prices and money supply respond instantaneously to changes in the repo rate by the South African reserve bank. Our analysis confirms that the South African repo rate is the relevant policy instrument for these economies as opposed to the LNS countries' central bank rates. The study concluded that under the existing monetary arrangement, the LNS economies may not be able to undertake independent monetary policy.

AB  - Romer and Romer (2004) propose a simple method to estimate monetary policy shocks using forecasts and real-time data. However, such data is not always (publicly) available, especially in a historical context. We explore the consequences of using revised data instead of the original forecast and real-time data when estimating policy shocks using the Romer and Romer framework. To this end, we estimate policy shocks for the same period as Romer and Romer. We find that using revised data has little impact on actual shock estimates, and the estimated effects of monetary policy shocks are similar.

AB  - This paper empirically examined the effect of monetary policy on domestic private investment in Nigeria from 1981 to 2018. In other to achieve our objectives, annual time series data of the dependent variable – domestic private investment (DPI) and independent variables – money supply (MS), government domestic debt (GDD), government domestic savings (GDS), interest rate (INT) and consumer price index (CPI) were collected from secondary sources like CBN Statistical Bulletin and WDI. Thereafter, the data were analyzed using descriptive statistics and the econometrics technique of Vector Error Correction Mechanism (ECM) method of analysis. The results of analysis indicated that a long run relationship exists among the variables. Furthermore, the paper revealed that money supply (MS), government domestic savings (GDS). interest rate (INT) and consumer price index (CPI) have a negative and insignificant effect on domestic private investment in the long run but interest rate is significant at 5%, while government domestic debt (GDD), has a positive and insignificant effect on domestic private investment (DPI) in the long run in Nigeria within the period. Based on the above findings, the paper recommends as follows: Expansionary monetary policy should be formulated that will reduce interest rate, encourage borrowings and savings. This will expand commercial banks and other credit granting financial institutions which will encourage real investment in the economy.

AB  - This paper discusses the impact of monetary policy on financial and macroeconomic variables in Russia. We distinguish two dimensions of monetary policy: (1) one caused by changes in the current rates; and (2) one caused by any other reason (such as forward guidance or communication or information from the central bank). We find that these two dimensions have distinct effects on financial variables. The first dimension better explains the variation of interest rates over the entire yield curve. In contrast, the second dimension is closely related to the variation in the exchange rate and market indices. Additionally, we also show that monetary policy transmission from interest rates to inflation takes about one year, but that this effect is only temporary.

AU  - Jung, Yongseung
AB  - Introducing habit formation into an open economy macro economic model with price stickiness, we examine the characteristics of an optimal monetary policy. We find that, first, the optimal policy rule entails interest rate smoothing and responds to the lagged values of the foreign interest rate and domestic technology shocks as well as their current values. Second, habit formation enriches the dynamics of the economy with a persistent, hump-shaped response of consumption to shocks. Finally, when habit formation does matter, the optimal policy rule achieves a greater welfare improvement over alternative policy rules by achieving lower macroeconomic variability.

T2  - Open Economies Review
AB  - This paper examines monetary policy spillovers from the US and the People’s Republic of China (PRC) to real and financial sectors in advanced and emerging Asian economies over the period 2000 to 2020. Using a structural vector autoregression (SVAR) approach, we find that Asian economies overall are more susceptible to spillovers to GDP, inflation, and the current account emanating from monetary policy shocks in the PRC than to those from the US. This is related to high inter-regional trade integration in Asia and is in line with previous research findings. However, while the prevailing literature has highlighted the dominant role of US monetary policy as a transmitter of shocks to global and Asian financial markets, we find more persistence in the response of advanced Asian interest rates to PRC monetary policy shocks. In addition, emerging Asian economies are found to be more susceptible to shocks emanating from the PRC in respect of equity markets and exchange rates. The rising synchronization of Asian financial markets in relation to the PRC as the financial account in the PRC has gradually opened as well as indirect effects via trade and regional value chains help to rationalize our findings.

TI  - Is the Lending Channel of Monetary Policy Dominant in Australia?
AU  - Suzuki, Tomoya
T2  - Economic Record
AB  - The transmission process of monetary policy is a longstanding macroeconomic issue. The lending view is that a monetary tightening affects aggregate demand by shifting the supply schedule of bank loans left. The contraction of bank loans does not necessarily mean a shift of the supply schedule. Therefore, testing the lending view requires the identification of the shifts of the demand and supply schedules in the bank loan market. This paper employs an original approach, finding that the lending channel is not dominant in Australia. The paper also examines features of Australian banks’ behaviour which make the lending channel less dominant.

TI  - Monetary Policy Under the Zero Interest Rate Constraint and Balance Sheet Adjustment
AU  - Shirakawa, Masaaki
T2  - International Finance
AB  - There are two contrasting evaluations of the conduct of Japan's monetary policy since the early 1990s. One is that monetary policy has not been eased enough to promote economic recovery in Japan. The other is that, since monetary policy has already been substantially eased, further easing would not contribute to economic recovery, but would rather delay the progress of structural reform that is a prerequisite for sustainable economic growth. With these evaluations in mind, this paper examines the effect of monetary policy in general and the effect of so-called ‘quantitative easing’ in particular when nominal short-term interest rates are zero and balance sheet adjustment is in progress.

Using an augmented Fama-French (1992, 1996) multifactor model, empirical results based on system GMM estimations and a sample of 449 firms shows that firms' stock returns responded negatively to monetary policy shocks. Moreover, the effect of domestic monetary policy shocks also have differential effects, with a statistically significant impact on small firms' equity returns but not on large firms' stock returns. The effect of international monetary policy upon equity returns is also heterogeneous by firm size; significant effects were observed for the equity returns of large firms but not for a case of small firms.

TI  - The Bank of Canada’s “Horse Race” of Alternative Monetary Policy Frameworks: Some Interim Results from Model Simulations
AU  - Dorich, José
AB  - Since 1991, the Bank of Canada has had an inflation‐targeting (IT) framework established by a
joint agreement between the Bank and the Government of Canada. The framework is reviewed
every five years as part of the process for renewing the inflation‐control agreement. This
discussion paper summarizes some interim results from Bank staff analysis done for the August
2020 workshop, “Towards the 2021 Renewal of the Bank of Canada’s Monetary Policy
Framework.” The Bank will publish updated analysis later in 2021. The core of the current
framework—the 2 percent inflation target—has remained unchanged since 1995. This fact
reflects its success. Well‐anchored inflation expectations contribute to macroeconomic stability
while leaving monetary policy with greater flexibility. The 2021 renewal highlights two key
challenges facing Canadian monetary policy: (1) the low neutral rate of interest; and (2) the low
interest rates associated with a low neutral rate that may encourage excessive risk taking and
debt accumulation To address these challenges, Bank staff are running a “horse race” of
alternative monetary policy frameworks (i.e., alternatives to the 2 percent IT framework). Their
work evaluates these alternatives using a broad range of qualitative and quantitative criteria
and focuses on the macroeconomic performance of the alternative frameworks. The interim
results we report in this discussion paper suggest overall that no framework dominates on all
margins. As a result, the ranking depends on the relative weight placed on different criteria.

price index during pre-crisis. However, oil price and the US industrial production greatly lose their effects on consumer price index and industrial production after the crisis period, the oil price is still mostly

AB  - Interest rates shock which is a measurement of monetary policy changes has significant effect on stock return. Most of the evidences are from the U.S., U.K, Japan and other developed countries. However, there is rare empirical analysis considering China’s case. As an important emerging stock market, China’s stock market shows many specific characters comparing with developed and strong efficient stock market. On the other hand, China’s base interest rates are only controlled by the central bank but not the monetary market which also differ from developed countries. So China’s specificities from both stock markets and interest rates determination mechanism motivate us to analyze the relationship between China’s stock return and interest rates shock. We 
first adopts Markov Regime Switching model to divide China’s market into Bull Market (highest mean, media variance), Volatility Market (media mean, lowest variance) and Bear Market (lowest mean, highest variance). And then we find monetary policy shocks do not have significantly negative impacts on the stock return either in the Bull Market regime or No-Market-Regime-Division data as a whole However, a significant negative relation between monetary policy shocks and stock return does exist in both the Bear and Volatility Market regimes.

AB  - This study intends to examine how residential prices are affected by monetary policy tools in Saudi Arabia. Quarterly secondary data for six years spanning from 2014q1-2019q2 were gtherered. The study analyzes the dynamic effects on housing prices of four macroeconomic variables, namely Money Supply (M2), Consumer Prices Index (CPI), Effective Exchange Rate (LEXC) and Lending Rate (LR). Vector Autoregression Analysis (VAR) is employed to capture the dynamic effect of the four macroeconomic variables on residential prices. Granger Causality, Variance Decomposition and Impulse response function are also used. The results show that residential prices are significantly and positively related to its indigeneity and to the effective exchange rate, whereas it is negatively and significantly related to lending rates. However, residential price index is negatively and insignificantly related to the levels of consumer price index. Variance decompositions show that M2 is the variable with the highest explanatory power over the variation of housing prices, followed by LER, EXCR and CPI respectively. The results of both the variance decomposition and impulse response function indicate that M2 is the most influential determinants for housing prices, implying that the future course of housing prices in KSA must be assessed accordingly.

AB  - This paper examines changes in the effects of unconventional monetary policies in the United States. To this end, we estimate a Markov-switching VAR model with absorbing regimes to capture possible structural changes. Our results detect regime changes around the beginning of 2011 and the middle of 2013. Before 2011, the U.S. large-scale asset purchases (LSAPs) had relatively large impacts on the real economy and prices, but after the middle of 2013, their effects were weaker and less-persistent. In addition, after the middle of 2013, which includes the monetary policy normalization period, the asset purchase (or balance sheet) shocks had slightly weaker effects than during the early stage of the LSAPs but stronger effects than during the late stage of the LSAPs, while interest rate shocks had insignificant effects on the real economy and prices. Finally, our results suggest that the positive responses of durables and capital goods expenditures to interest rate shocks weakened the negative impacts of interest rate hikes after the middle of 2013 including the period of monetary policy normalization.

AB  - We estimate a small structural model for inflation, the output gap, the domestic interest rate and the exchange rate for Hungary during the period of the transition (1991-99). The transmission of monetary policy impulses to macro variables is characterized in a similar fashion to that of advanced open industrial countries. In particular, in the context of our rational expectations, forward-looking model, the interest rate channel on aggregate demand and the exchange rate channel work together as parts of the same disinflation policy. We draw several conclusions on understanding and modeling the effects of monetary policy, and also on the desirable design of policy rules during the process of disinflation.

AU  - Caldara, Dario
AU  - Herbst, Edward
T2  - American Economic Journal: Macroeconomics
AB  - In this paper we develop a Bayesian framework to estimate a proxy structural vector autoregression to identify monetary policy shocks. We find that during the Great Moderation period, monetary policy shocks induce a persistent decline in real activity and tightening in financial conditions. Central to this result is a systematic component of monetary policy characterized by a direct and economically significant reaction to changes in corporate credit spreads. The failure to account for this endogenous reaction induces an attenuation in the response of all variables to monetary shocks, a result that also applies to the narrative identification of Romer and Romer (2004).

TI  - Threshold Effects of Monetary Policy on Tourism Demand: A Panel Smooth Transition Regression Model
AU  - Chou, Chin-Mei
AB  - This paper employs the panel smooth transition regression (PSTR) model to evaluate the threshold effects of monetary policy on inbound tourism and its determinants. The panel dataset includes the nineteen main countries from which there was inbound tourism to China during the 2006–2018 period. The empirical results indicate that the marginal effect of the determinants (gross domestic product (GDP), customer price index (CPI), and the substitution effect) on inbound tourism is nonlinear for different time, country, and transition variables. Moreover, prior currency devaluation policy (against the US dollar) can nonlinearly reduce the positive impact of GDP and the substitution effect in Greater China on inbound tourism and nonlinearly increase the negative effect of CPI on inbound tourism in China. Clearly, the government’s monetary policy plays an important role in moderating China’s tourism demand and its determinants.

TI  - Monetary Policy and Price Stability in Nigeria: 1981-2015
AU  - Nwamuo, Chukwuemeka
AB  - The study investigated the impact of monetary policy on price stability in Nigeria. Annual data covering 1981 –2015 were utilized. Unit root test was conducted using Augmented Dickey-Fuller test method and the result showed that the variables were stationary though at different levels. Co-integration test was also conducted using Johanssen co-integration technique and the result revealed that the variables in the model are co-integrated implying that the variables have a long run relationship. The model was estimated using ordinary least square method and the result revealed that money supply and liquidity ratio have a significant impact with price stability. The result revealed that 96.27 percent of the total variation in the model is caused by changes in the explanatory variables. Based on these findings, the study recommends that the central bank should adopt appropriate monetary policy by reducing money supply, increasing the liquidity ratio as these will lead to reduction in consumer’s price index.

AB  - This study aims to analyze the contributions of the variable interactions of monetary policy in the stability of goods and services prices. Where is the monetary &nbsp;policy variable (inflation, kurs, consumer price index, gross domestic products, the money supply, and interest rates). Research in conducted in the country of Indonesia and uses secondary data or time series from 2008 to 2021. The data analysis model in this study is Simultaneous Model. Simultaneous equations to analyze the relation between independent and variable variables found in the research country. Simultaneous analysis of equations on statistical test common equation 1 suggests that variable interest rates, money distribution, exchange rates and consumer price indexes have significant adverse effects on the inflation. Whereas in the same equation 2, it suggests that gross domestic product variables have a positive relationship that is significant to the ihk. And inflation has a negative relationship significantly insignificant to consumer price index. For this reason, the researcher hopes that the monetary authority, namely Bank Indonesia, can improve monetary stability and maintain the BI rate in regulating the money supply so that it can suppress the inflation rate as an effort to stabilize the prices.

TI  - International Policy Coordination and Simple Monetary Policy Rules
AU  - Berger, Wolfram
AU  - Wagner, Helmut
AB  - This paper studies the optimal design of monetary policy in an optimizing two-country sticky price model. We suppose that the production sequence of final consumption goods stretches across both countries and is associated with vertical trade. Prices of final consumption goods are sticky in the consumer`s currency. Pursuing an inward-looking policy, as suggested in recent work, is not optimal in this set-up. We also ask which simple, i.e. non-optimal, targeting rule best supports the welfare maximizing policy. The results hinge critically on the degree of price flexibility and the relative importance of cost-push and productivity shocks. In many cases, a strict targeting of price indices like producer or consumer price indices is dominated by rules that allow for some fluctuations in prices such as nominal income or monetary targeting.

TI  - Impact of the Monetary Policy Instruments on Islamic Stock Market Index Return
AU  - Albaity, Mohamed S.
AB  - Previous studies found that Islamic stock market index in Malaysia (KLSI), does not react, or react negatively to interest rate, although one of the main criteria of Islamic finance is to avoid business and activities that yield interest because of its prohibition in Islamic laws. On the other hand, studies of Islamic stock market index in the US (DJIMI) found that there is no impact of interest rate on DJIMI. These two stock market indices have different screening criteria and different composite of securities. This study aims at investigating the monetary policy variables impact, the effect of interest rate, and the use of stock market indices as a hedge against inflation. It also examines the volatilities of monetary variables, interest rates, and inflation rate on two Islamic stock market indices. Using time series analysis such as GARCH the results are as follows. It is found that in the variance univariate models of the conventional indices that M1, M3, inflation rate, and real growth in GDP are significant in influencing KLCI volatility, while M2, M3, inflation rate and interest rate affected DJINA volatility. On the other hand, in the Islamic indices, KLSI and DJIMI variance is influenced by M2, M3, and inflation rate. In addition, in the multivariate model, DJIMI is influenced by the interest rate and the inflation rate in the mean and variance equations. In contrast, KLSI is influenced commonly in the mean and variance equations by M3, and the inflation rate.

TI  - Is the monetary policy rate effective? Recent evidence from Ghana
AU  - Akosah, Nana K.
AB  - We examine the effectiveness of monetary policy transmission mechanism in Ghana using several of statistical and econometric techniques for the period 2002M1 - 2014M12. We find monetary policy rate (MPR) to be quite effective in signaling the money market interest rates in both the short run and long run, as the effect is incomplete (that is, not one-to-one). In addition, a hierarchy of short-term money market rates in Ghana is identified as follows: Monetary Policy Rate, Treasury bill rate, Interbank rate and retail rates (preferably, lending rate), accentuating the large role played by Treasury bill interest rate in the interest rate transmission channel in Ghana. Essentially, monetary authority responds positively and contemporaneously to output and inflationary pressures. Inflation is mostly driven by interest rate shock over the medium to long term, pointing to an impact of monetary policy. In the short term, however, exchange rate shock has relatively larger influence on inflation than that emanating from interest rate. In contrast, output is largely driven by credit and assets prices shocks. This suggests that agents' knowledge about future output prospects are immediately reflected in assets prices before impacting on output. The paper therefore supports policies that would promote strong financial and macroeconomic stability to help inure effective monetary policy transmission in Ghana.

AU  - Ltd, ICB-InterConsult Bulgaria
T2  - Romanian Journal of Political Sciences
AB  - Monetary policy is considered to be one of the most important public policies influencing not only the level of prices in economy, the volatility of exchange rates or interest rates, but also the structure of production of goods and services. This paper analyses the importance of monetary policy for economic growth and for macroeconomic (in)stability using a newly built database with original information collected by the authors. It provides an empirical illustration of the relationship between the declared objectives and targets of monetary policy in different countries and their economic performance (measured by GDP growth rate, GDP per capita and other indicators) through a discriminant analysis framework.

AB  - During the 1990s the Chilean economy gradually cut its inflation rate from figures in the thirties to 4.7 percent in 1998. Central bank authorities have declared that the main objective of monetary policy is to reduce inflation to levels comparableto those in industrial countries. The desgnated instrument of thet monetary policy has been an indexed interest rate, through which the central bank has sought to influnce the path of real market rates over different time horizons.

AB  - The papers in this volume were presented and discussed at the Autumn Central Bank Economists' Meeting held at the BIS in Basel on 14-15 October 2002. The purpose of this meeting was to discuss challenges that central banks have faced in the current environment characterised by low and comparatively stable inflation, structural supply side improvements, the apparently high credibility of central banks' anti-inflation commitment and liberalised financial markets. These challenges have included learning how to deal with unforeseen potential increases in productivity growth, major expansions in credit and asset prices, and, in some cases, even financial instability and deflation.

AB  - We use the Factor-Augmented Vector Autoregression (FAVAR) approach of Bernanke, Boivin and Eliasz (2005) to estimate the effects of monetary policy shocks on wages and employment in the euro area. The use of a large data set comprising country, sectoral and euro area-wide data allows us to better identify common monetary policy shocks in the euro area and their effects on labor market outcomes. At the same time the FAVAR approach gives us estimates of how relative wages and employment in the various countries and sectors respond to these common shocks. The ultimate objective of our work is to relate the estimated cross-country differences in wage and employment responses to differences in labor market institutions and sectoral composition.
