TI  - Exchange rate anomalies in the industrial countries: A solution with a structural VAR approach
AU  - Kim, Soyoung

T2  - Journal of Monetary Economics
AB  - Past empirical research on the effects of monetary policy in closed and open economies found evidence of several anomalies, such as the ‘liquidity’, ‘price’, ‘exchange rate’ and ‘forward discount bias’ puzzles. In this paper, we develop an approach that provides a solution to these empirical anomalies in an open economy setup. We use a ‘structural VAR’ approach with non-recursive contemporaneous restrictions and we identify monetary policy shocks by modeling the reaction function of the monetary authorities and the structure of the economy. Our empirical findings are that effects of non-US G-7 monetary policy shocks on exchange rates and other macroeconomic variables are consistent with the predictions of a broad set of theoretical models. The evidence is consistent with significant, but transitory, real effects of monetary shocks. The ‘price’ puzzle is addressed and there is little evidence of open economy anomalies. Specifically, initially the exchange rate appreciates in response to a monetary contraction; but after a few months, the exchange rate depreciates over time in accordance with the uncovered interest parity condition. Overall, our identification scheme gives results that contribute to resolve the empirical anomalies about the effects of monetary policy shocks found in the literature.

TI  - Revival of Legacy of Tooke and Gibson: Implications for Monetary Policy
AU  - Rehman, Atiq-ur
T2  - Journal of Central Banking Theory and Practice
AB  - Abstract The monetary policy rules used by central banks these days are based on the assumption that inflation could be reduced by increasing interest rate. On contrary, Tooke (1774-1858), the forefather of monetary economics, was of the view that the relationship between interest rate and inflation should be positive. His view was based on simple logic, ‘interest is a part of cost, and therefore, the increase in interest rate should increase inflation by increasing cost of production (Tooke, 1838)’. Tooke’s view has got support from a number of empirical evidence including Gibson (1923) who found positive correlation between two variables for UK data over a period of 200 years. On the other hand, mainstream economic thinking on which the actual monetary practices are based ignored any possibility of positive relationship between interest rate and inflation throughout the history. The existence of Tooke’s cost side effects of monetary policy is a serious concern because if these effects exist than the use of monetary policy would be counterproductive. Using the data from entire globe, I attempt to explore the nature of relationship between the interest rate and inflation. I found that the data supports the perception of Tooke and Gibson and denies

AB  - The objective of this research is to examine the monetary policy's impact on economic growth. Variables of study are Gross domestic product, Inflation, rate of interest, Exchange rate, Money supply, Investment, and Consumer Price Index and time series data is collected from. Gross domestic product is a dependent variable and all other variables are independent and have a great effect on the explanatory variable. In this study, the Augmented dicky fuller test is used to check out the stationarity of our selected variables and after that autoregressive distributed lag model co-integration technique is applied to estimate the parameters of the model. The result shows that inflation, interest rate, and consumer price index show a negative impact on gross domestic product. While other variables such as exchange rate, money supply, and investment show a positive impact on GDP. The study recommended that the desired level of output and employment can be attained by adopting sufficient strategies that reduce inflation in the economy.

AB  - This paper estimates the macroeconomic effects of the Bank of Japan's expansionary monetary policies since the introduction of Quantitative and Qualitative Monetary Easing (QQE) using the Bank of Japan's large-scale macroeconomic model, Q-JEM (Quarterly Japanese Economic Model). We consider counterfactual paths of major financial variables, such as real interest rates, constructing hypothetical scenarios where the QQE and subsequent easing measures had not been introduced. We then conduct counterfactual simulations to examine how Japan's macroeconomic variables such as real GDP and CPI would have evolved under those hypothetical scenarios. In this setting, we estimate the policy effects on the macroeconomic variables as the difference between actual values and the counterfactual. Estimation results show that, on average during the period from the introduction of QQE to the July-September quarter of 2020, the policy effect on the level of real GDP is between around +0.9 and +1.3 percent and that on the year-on-year rate of change in the CPI (all items less fresh food and energy) is between around +0.6 and +0.7 percentage points.

We apply Granger Causality and VAR methods on monthly data of Indonesian banking, during the period of January 2003 to December 2009. The result shows that conventional policy rate is transmitted to output and inflation, while Islamic policy rate are not. In addition, the shock of conventional interest rate, credit and interbank rate give a negative and permanent impacts on inflation and output, except for SBI (Certificate of Bank Indonesia) with positive impact to inflation  though negatively affect the output. On the other hand, the shock of PLS, financing and Islamic interbank PLS, as well as SBIS (Central Bank Shariah Certificate) give positive and permanent impacts on inflation and output.

This approach, useful for central bankers or researchers interested in the effects of tapering, allows us to evaluate the consequences of a given monetary policy path on the future evolution of key macroeconomic indicators. The results based on this methodology provide a measurement of the differences in economic performance under contractionary and expansionary policies and support the recent success of monetary stimuli in boosting real indicators while having little effect on inflation.

AB  - Most empirical analyses of monetary policy have been confined to frameworks in which the Federal Reserve is implicitly assumed to exploit only a limited amount of information, despite the fact that the Fed actively monitors literally thousands of economic time series. This article explores the feasibility of incorporating richer information sets into the analysis, both positive and normative, of Fed policymaking. We employ a factor-model approach, developed by Stock, J.H., Watson, M.W., Diffusion Indices, Journal of Business & Economic Statistics 2002, 20 (2) 147, Forecasting Inflation, 1999, Journal of Monetary Economics 44 (2) 293, that permits the systematic information in large data sets to be summarized by relatively few estimated factors. With this framework, we reconfirm Stock and Watson's result that the use of large data sets can improve forecast accuracy, and we show that this result does not seem to depend on the use of finally revised (as opposed to “real-time”) data. We estimate policy reaction functions for the Fed that take into account its data-rich environment and provide a test of the hypothesis that Fed actions are explained solely by its forecasts of inflation and real activity. Finally, we explore the possibility of developing an “expert system” that could aggregate diverse information and provide benchmark policy settings.

TI  - Exchange Rate Misalignment, Capital Flows, and Optimal Monetary Policy Trade-Offs
AU  - Corsetti, Giancarlo

AU  - Leduc, Sylvain
AB  - What determines the optimal monetary trade-off between internal objectives (inflation, and output gap) and external objectives (competitiveness and trade imbalances) when inefficient capital flows cause exchange rate misalignment and distort current account positions? We characterize this trade-off analytically, using the workhorse model of modern monetary theory in open economies under incomplete markets--where inefficient capital flows and exchange rate misalignments can arise independently of nominal distortions. We derive a quadratic approximation of the utility-based global policy loss function under fairly general assumptions on preferences and openness, and solve for the optimal targeting rules under co-operation. We show that, in economies with a low degree of exchange rate pass-through, the optimal response to inefficient capital inflows associated with real appreciation is contractionary, above and beyond the natural rate: the optimal policy curbs excessive demand at the cost of exacerbating currency overvaluation. In contrast, a high degree of pass-through, and/or low trade elasticities, warrants expansionary policies that lean against exchange rate appreciation and competitive losses, at the cost of inefficient inflation.

We analyze how domestic credit market conditions have affected the current account performance. Implementing Granger-causality tests on time series data over the period 1990-1994, we find that current account performance was negatively affected by credit contraction. Furthermore, using desegregated data on credit, we are able to show that credit to small enterprises is highly significant to explain current account performance as well as the level of unemployment.

The analysis is conducted using impulse response functions derived from a factor-augmented vector autoregression (FAVAR) model. The FAVAR methodology as developed by Bernanke et al. (2005) avoids the degrees of freedom problem present in standard vector autoregression (VARs) models. The estimations are conducted using 120 macroeconomic time series in monthly frequency for the period January 1959 to August 2001. Results indicate that housing starts respond negatively to monetary policy shocks. This result is consistent across regions in the United States. In the case of housing permits and mobile home shipments, the response to a monetary policy shock is positive at first, but becomes negative after a few periods.

AU  - Ribon, Sigal
AB  - This study uses cross-sectional data for the years 19972006 to examine the effects of monetary policy on different manufacturing industries. The effects of interest-rate shocks and exchange-rate shocks on the amount produced and the price (to the consumer) in each of 16 industries was studied by means of a system of VAR equations that incorporated five endogenous variables - the Bank of Israel interest rate, the shekel/dollar exchange rate, labor costs per hour, price, and quantity produced. It was found that a rise in the interest rate was generally reflected in a reduction in the amount produced, in conjunction with a fall in price that expressed the effect of demand. An exchange-rate shock was reflected by a price rise in nearly all industries, usually with a cumulative decline in the amount produced. The second part of the study examines the connection between the characteristics of the different industries and their responses to interest-rate and exchange-rate shocks. It was found that the effect on demand of an interest-rate shock was greater in industries that produce consumer durables. It was also found that a price rise in response to an interest-rate increase was smaller in high-tech industries and industries in which production is concentrated in a few companies. In the concentrated industries, a temporary increase in the exchange rate is reflected to a larger extent in a rise in prices.

AU  - Lavally, Mohamed
AU  - Nyambe, Jacob M.
AB  - Studies on the effectiveness of transmission mechanisms of monetary policy are crucial for an economy. It is essential to understand how effective are the channels of monetary transmission in directing economic activities in Sierra Leone. In this case, particular focus is on the interest rate, exchange rate, and credit channels. The analytical methods used are unit root tests, cointegration test, Granger causality test, impulse responses and variance decomposition. Central to this investigation is the use of the Vector Autoregression (VAR) approach to estimate time series annual data from 1980 to 2012. The cointegration test result revealed that cointegration exists. The
Granger causality test showed that gross capital formation Granger causes exchange rate and real interest rate. The impulse response function showed that output responded positively to monetary shocks, as interest rate increased. For exchange rate and private domestic credit, output showed that even in the long run, the effects of the shocks might not be transitory in order to converge towards a steady state. The variance decomposition indicated that fluctuations in gross domestic product per capita (GDPPC) were attributed to itself. While the total contribution of the real interest rate (RIR) and exchange rate (ER) was relatively insignificant. The error forecast of RIR was attributed by itself with an insignificant contribution of GDPPC and none by ER and private domestic credit (PDC). Fluctuations in forecasting ER were greatly attributed to itself and trivial contributions by the other variables. As the trend fell, there was a slight increase in the contribution of the other variables. The results provided evidence of ineffective channels in the Sierra Leone economy.

T2  - Iranian Economic Review
AB  - Using Nigeria as a case study, this study shows that changes in oil price is central to the monetary transmission mechanism in oil-producing countries; a phenomenon which can be described as petro-monetary transmission mechanism. Using a Markov state-switching model, this study shows that there are high and low inflation regimes in the Nigerian economy. Oil price has significant impacts on inflation in the two regimes. Among the common coefficients, exchange rate and credit have significant effects. The empirical evidence from the impulse response functions of the VAR model shows that a one standard deviation shock to credit, interest rate, exchange rate, and oil price generates sharp increases in CPI, thus establishing a petro-monetary transmission mechanism in Nigeria. This study therefore establishes the presence of petro-monetary transmission mechanism in oil-producing countries. The central banks in these countries should therefore consider changes in oil price in the conduct of monetary policy.

TI  - The Diminishing Impact of Monetary Policy on Asset Prices Around Non-FOMC Macroeconomic Announcements
AU  - Alam, Zohair
AB  - I develop a simple methodology to measure monetary news around non-FOMC macroeconomic announcements to examine its effects on asset prices. I focus on a parsimonious set of macro announcements that are directly relevant to the setting of Fed policy. While FOMC announcements are known to have similar effects during periods of conventional and unconventional monetary policies, I show that monetary news around macro announcements affect asset prices much less in the latter period. Moreover, bond premium, volatility and the overall resolution of uncertainty decrease less on these announcements during the unconventional period too. These findings are described in an information framework to argue that the falling precision of the signal that markets receive regarding forthcoming Fed actions potentially drives the diminishing impact of monetary news on asset prices on macro announcements. Taken together, the evidence suggests unconventional monetary policies deter market's ability to anticipate Fed actions, which has implications for its transmission to asset prices.

TI  - Estimating the Effects of Monetary Policy in Australia Using Sign-restricted Structural Vector Autoregressions
AU  - Reserve Bank of Australia
AU  - Read, Matthew
AB  - Existing estimates of the macroeconomic effects of Australian monetary policy tend to be based on strong, potentially contentious, assumptions. I estimate these effects under weaker assumptions. Specifically, I estimate a structural vector autoregression identified using a variety of sign restrictions, including restrictions on impulse responses to a monetary policy shock, the monetary policy reaction function, and the relationship between the monetary policy shock and a proxy for this shock. I use an approach to Bayesian inference that accounts for the problem of posterior sensitivity to the choice of prior that arises in this setting, which turns out to be important. Some sets of identifying restrictions are not particularly informative about the effects of monetary policy. However, combining the restrictions allows us to draw some useful inferences. There is robust evidence that an increase in the cash rate lowers output and consumer prices at horizons beyond a year or so. The results are consistent with the macroeconomic effects of a 100 basis point increase in the cash rate lying towards the upper end of the range of existing estimates.

TI  - Monetary policy transmission mechanisms in Serbia: evidence from the fully-fledged inflation targeting regime
AU  - Stojanović, Danilo

T2  - Post-Communist Economies
AB  - This article examines the effectiveness of monetary transmission mechanisms in the Serbian economy, covering the period from January 2009 (the point at which the formal switch to the fully-fledged inflation targeting regime was made) to December 2013. The results of the recursive VAR models suggest that the exchange rate and credit channels play a major role in the monetary transmission process, whereas this is not true in the case of the interest rate channel. However, the results of the non-recursive VAR models show that the role of the exchange rate has diminished over time. On the other hand, the credit channel has become much more influential. Thus, if one of the overriding objectives of adopting the explicit inflation targeting regime is to enhance the importance of other channels apart from the exchange rate channel, which could make monetary policy more effective in achieving price and financial stability, the switch to the inflation targeting regime is justified.

AB  - We consider international monetary policy regimes in a world of two identical economies characterized by unemployment persistence. In the non-cooperative regime, Markov-perfect Nash equilibrium policies are generally not unique. Furthermore, policies may be asymmetric in this otherwise symmetric model. Monetary policy cooperation also exhibits multiple equilibria but these are fewer and always symmetric. Cooperation may be counterproductive or beneficial for either country depending upon the initial non-cooperative and resulting cooperative outcome.

TI  - Monetary Policy Responses to Crude Oil-Price Shocks: The Case of Selected Central Banks
AU  - Mwange, Austin
AU  - Meyiwa, Ayanda
AB  - Since the establishment of Central Banks, they have been responsible for their national economic stabilization. This paper explores how selected banks have responded to oil price shocks. Firstly, the paper provides a critical analysis of the effects of commodity price shocks using a version of the three equations – the New Keynesian model. Secondly, the paper chronologically investigates past responses to shocks from five central banks, emphasizing similar and extreme responses and their success. Lastly, the paper utilizes the historical analysis to formulate a recommended response for central banks today. The major outcome of this study is the culmination of a recommendation that proactively implementing contractionary monetary policy alongside expansionary fiscal policy, using conventional and unconventional policies is the most effective.

AB  - What are the implications of tighter credit conditions on how the repo rate responds to positive inflation shocks? Evidence shows that credit conditions shocks induce less variation in inflation compared to those due to the repo rate shocks. But credit conditions induce more fluctuations in GDP growth compared to the repo rate. Furthermore, we find that tighter credit conditions exert non-linear effects on GDP growth and the effects were accentuated post-2008Q4. GDP growth declines more in the presence of credit conditions compared to when the credit conditions are shut off in the inflation equation. This suggests that tight credit conditions worsen the GDP growth decline due to positive inflation shocks. The amplification effects are not only restricted to positive inflation shock effects. The decline in GDP growth rate is pronounced in the presence of tight credit conditions compared to when these are shut off. Thus, credit conditions play a significant role in GDP growth dynamics as a transmitter of positive inflation and repo rate shocks. Tight credit conditions neutralise (dampen) the effects of the R/US$ exchange rate depreciation shock on inflationary pressures. This has implications for the repo rate response to inflationary pressures. Tight credit conditions and muted GDP growth lead to less aggressive repo rate responses to inflationary pressures. In the absence of credit-driven demand pressures on inflation, tight credit conditions and muted GDP growth have a significant impact on the pace and magnitude of repo rate responses to inflation.

AB  - This chapter studies optimal monetary stabilization policy in interdependent open economies, by proposing a unified analytical framework systematizing the existing literature. In the model, the combination of complete exchange-rate pass-through (‘producer currency pricing’) and frictionless asset markets ensuring efficient risk sharing, results in a form of open–economy ‘divine coincidence’: in line with the prescriptions in the baseline New-Keynesian setting, the optimal monetary policy under cooperation is characterized by exclusively inward-looking targeting rules in domestic output gaps and GDP-deflator inflation. The chapter then examines deviations from this benchmark, when cross-country strategic policy interactions, incomplete exchange-rate pass-through (‘local currency pricing’) and asset market imperfections are accounted for. Namely, failure to internalize international monetary spillovers results in attempts to manipulate international relative prices to raise national welfare, causing inefficient real exchange rate fluctuations. Local currency pricing and incomplete asset markets (preventing efficient risk sharing) shift the focus of monetary stabilization to redressing domestic as well as external distortions: the targeting rules characterizing the optimal policy are not only in domestic output gaps and inflation, but also in misalignments in the terms of trade and real exchange rates, and cross-country demand imbalances.

AB  - This paper addresses the issue of monetary policy effectiveness, the price puzzle, and the positive response of prices to monetary tightening in Pakistan. The study examines the effects of the monetary policy shock on the price level and other macroeconomic variables such as output, exchange rate, and money supply within the structural VAR framework over the period 1992: Ml to 2010: M08. We find that a contractionary monetary policy shock has a positive effect on prices and the output increase over some horizon following the monetary tightening, but continuously falls after initial rise. The results also indicate that monetary contractions in Pakistan, over the period reviewed, are associated with the persistent depreciation of domestic currency value relative to the US dollar.

The approach followed in the formulation of the econometric model is based on the Quantity Theory of Money and uses stationarity and cointegration tests. The policy implications of the paper are the following: the control of inflation requires the Public Expenditure to be bounded; some Public Expenditure should be used for formation of Human Capital and Fixed Capital; there is evidence supporting the Quantity Theory of Money in East Timor.

AU  - Inui, Masayuki
AU  - Sudou, Nao
AU  - Yamada, Tomoaki
AB  - The impacts of monetary easing on inequality have been attracting increasing attention recently. In this paper, we use the micro-level data on Japanese households to study the distributional effects of monetary policy. We construct quarterly series of income and consumption inequality measures from 1981 to 2008, and estimate their response to a monetary policy shock. We find that monetary policy shocks do not have a statistically significant impact on inequality across Japanese households in a stable manner. When considering inequality across households whose head is employed, we find evidence that, before the 2000s, an expansionary monetary policy shock increased income inequality through a rise in earnings inequality. Such procyclical responses are, however, scarcely observed when the current data are included in the sample period, or when earnings inequality across all households is considered. We also find that transmission of income inequality to consumption inequality is minor, including during the period when procyclicality of income inequality was pronounced. Using a two-sector dynamic general equilibrium model with attached labor inputs, we show that labor market flexibility is central to the dynamics of income inequality after monetary policy shocks. We also use the micro-level data on households' balance sheets and show that distributions of households' financial assets and liabilities do not play a significant role in the distributional effects of monetary policy.

AB  - Monetary policy represents one of the most powerful instruments of economic policy, via which economy is acted upon. The transmission mechanism is precisely the process via which monetary policy decisions move economy as a whole. From the central bank’s point of view, the transmission of monetary policy to the economy is of distinguished interest among various topics of macroeconomics. Without being aware of the monetary transmission mechanism it is not possible to conduct good policy. This paper applies the identified VAR methodology to synthetic national data from 2000 till Q2 2007 to study the macro-economic effects of an unexpected change in monetary policy in Romania.

The research papers of various authors have been studied in this regard to prove the Hypothesis and after in depth analysis by applying Regression Analysis technique it has been observed that the relationship between the two exists. The data of past 30 years of Pakistan has been used for driving the conclusion. The study proved that the interest rate has minor relationship with GDP but the Growth in Money Supply greatly affects the GDP of an economy, obviously various unknown factors also affects the GDP. Growth in Money Supply has a huge impact on GDP. The Research study can further be used for developmental projects for the Growth of Economy, Quality improvements, Household production, the underground economy, Health and life expectancy, the environment, Political immunity and ethnic justice.

AB  - The main objective of this study was to analyze Cape Verdean monetary policy, the rules chosen by the decision makers, its changes and its transmission to the economy. Primarily, we analyzed the dynamics of the most important Cape Verdean macroeconomic time series. By using the Vector Autoregression (VAR) and the Markov Switching Vector Autoregression (MS-VAR) models, we also analyzed and compared how those dynamics were connected to the monetary policy regime adopted during the period of 1991 to 2011. We tried two models, in the second of which was included the effective exchange rate index in order to capture transmissions of the exchange rate channel.. Through the MS-VAR, we also estimated two regimes which were statistically identified. The second regime seems to be more persistent and characterized the entire period from 1993 to 2006, which matches with important changes in Cape Verde&#39;s economy. We compare the impulse-response functions estimated by using the VAR model and the impulse-response regime-dependent functions estimated by MS-VAR models. The latter indicated that only in the second regime does a positive shock in the residuals of interest rate have the expected effects, decreasing the output level and the price index.

AB  - Proper conduct of monetary policy requires understanding the monetary transmission mechanism, to monitor the economy, make decisions on the stance of policy, and explain the policy actions to the public. Hence, gathering evidence on the monetary transmission mechanism in the euro area has been a priority for the Eurosystem. This 2003 book presents the results of a multi-year collaborative project conducted by the European Central Bank and the other Eurosystem central banks. First, macro data are consistently investigated with both VARs and structural models for the area as a whole and for individual countries. Second, the book contains an unprecedented set of studies on the effects of monetary policy using bank and firm panel data. The results described in country case studies and overview essays by central bank economists, along with a discussion chapter by eminent academics, provide an essential contribution to research on the subject.

AB  - A rough description of macroeconomic policy in South Africa would be that monetary policy concentrates on building nominal credibility through focusing on inflation, while the brunt of the responsibility for output stabilization rests on fiscal policy. This aricle discusses the convenience of such a policy mix. First, we estimate the business cycle impact of fiscal and monetary policy to find that so far fiscal policy has been mostly pro-cyclical, whereas monetary policy has been, over the last couple of years, mildly counter-cyclical. We argue that fiscal policy should be made significantly more counter-cyclical than it has been – a strategy that would deliver more macroeconomic stability and potentially higher growth. Furthermore, we believe the Central Bank has earned the credibility to operate macro policy with a more decisive output stabilization objective, and we discuss several reinterpretations of the inflation targeting regime that provide the flexibility to do so without risking the strong anti-inflationary credibility of the SARB. On exchange rate policy we recommend that the authorities take a pragmatic approach to floating, mostly allowing the currency to move freely, but intervening to avoid overvaluation. We explain why and discuss how this objective could be achieved.

AB  - <em>Over the years, the banking sector in Nigeria has come up with different activities and policies to check relative economic stability and better the economy. With the introduction of monetary policy, it is expected that monetary stability and a sound financial system would be achieved. Thus, this study examined the impact of monetary policy instruments in achieving price stability in Nigeria for the period 2015-2019. Monetary policy was proxied by monetary policy rate (MPR) and money supply (M2) while Price stability was proxied by consumer price index (CPI). Autoregressive Distributed Lag model (ARDL) was employed to analyze the data in order to determine the “individual impacts of independent variable on the dependent variable. Findings showed that monetary policy rate (MPR) and Money supply (M2) had positive and significant impact on consumer price index (CPI) in Nigeria. However, the study showed that “individual impact of Monetary Policy Rate (t=2.753) and Broad money (t=6.686445) on Consumer Price Index in Nigeria were more significant than that of speed adjustment of CPI to MPR and M2 with positive co-efficient. (0.002414).The study concluded that monetary policy instruments have a significant impact on price stability in Nigeria. The researcher recommended, that well - structured monetary policy instruments like open market operation (OMO), Liquidity ratio, cash reserve ratio and the likes can be used to achieve price stability. Ammonizing of monetary and Fiscal authorities, licensing of non-interest banks by CBN should be considered in order to achieve effective result.</em>

AB  - We show that despite heterogeneous financial intermediation structures in EMEs, bank credit remains a powerful channel of policy transmission in these countries. Credit conditions have been affected by global factors. In particular, our empirical results suggest that exchange rate appreciation tends to boost credit expansion through a currency risk-taking channel. To the extent that new credit boosts growth which in turn generates further appreciation, the link creates the possibility of positive feedback loops. Furthermore, we find that risk premium shocks have had important effects on EMEs, through their impact on both bank and non-bank credit. Against this backdrop, we argue that the standard monetary policy rules may be inadequate in meeting the multi-faceted challenges arising from financial globalization, and there is a growing case for expanding the policy toolkit.

In particular, using bank data from the period 1959 to 2007, I show that the effect of monetary policy shocks on banks’ credit has significantly decreased over time. My results contrast significantly with previous finding in the literature (Bernanke and Blinder, 1992). As potential explanations to the lower effect of monetary shocks, I describe some of the changes in bank regulation that triggered bank consolidation and changes in the bank-size distribution, as well as changes in the banks’ portfolio towards an increasing share of real estate loans.

AB  - This study analyzes a two-country dynamic general equilibrium model with nominal rigidities, monopolistic competition and producer currency pricing. A quadratic approximation to the utility of the consumers is derived and assumed as the policy objective function of the policymakers. It is shown that only under special conditions there are no gains from cooperation and moreover that the paths of the exchange rate and prices in the constrained-efficient solution depend on the kind of disturbance that affects the economy. Despite this result, simple targeting rules that involve only targets for the growth of output and for both domestic GDP and CPI inflation rates can replicate the cooperative allocation.

AB  - This paper describes the changes that occurred in the conduct and instruments of monetary policy used by major central banks when the crisis hit; discusses the new tradeoffs and controversies engendered by those policy reactions; and speculates about additional likely future changes in monetary policy and institutions. Following a brief account of the evolution of monetary policymaking principles and institutions in the past, the paper deals with the controversial question of how and when to exit a period of large-scale monetary expansion. The paper documents the fact that, in spite of huge monetary injections and historically low interest rates, inflation in the US and in the Eurozone remained subdued, and reports that since the onset of the subprime crisis, there has been a dramatic deceleration in the growth of banking credit in the US. The paper also discusses the tradeoff between the lender-of-last-resort function of the central bank and moral hazard; the consequences of bailout uncertainty for central bank policy; and the particular problems faced by the ECB in the face of a major financial crisis.

The author uses the effects of macroeconomic policy is the key in this research, by applying the matrix model SVAR initiated by Bernanke & Mihov (1998) short term and Blancard & Quah (1989) long term. Research conducted using the 4 variables, consisting of two domestic variables, namely the interest rate of Bank Indonesia (SBI), the consumer price index (CPI) and two non-domestic variables, namely the interest rate the central bank United States(FFF), the rate of inflation in the United States (INF_USA). From the research that has been done can be inferred that the SVAR models used in this study can be used as a reference to the theoretical expectations in order to show that the rise in interest rates and the central bank of the United States could affect Indonesia's domestic variables.

TI  - Monetary policy transmission mechanism and bank portfolio behaviour: the case of Indonesia
AU  - Wibowo, Pungky Purnomo
AB  - This thesis assesses the implications of financial deregulation and financial innovation on
the following aspects of monetary policy transmission and bank portfolio behaviour in
Indonesia. Chapter 4 investigates monetary policy transmission by employing bank
balance sheet (loans, deposits and securities) and main macroeconomic variables
(exchange rates, stock market index, output and consumer price index). Furthermore, the
chapter investigates empirically, using V AR systems, the existence of each channel in the
changing financial environment are evaluated for aggregate data (all banks) and
disaggregate data across five groups of banks (foreign banks, private banks, mixed banks,
regional banks and state banks) by investigating their impulse responses, variance
decompositions and accumulated effects. Our observation covers the period of January
1980 to December 2001. In order to capture the effect of financial deregulation which
assumed to bring innovations in monetary policy and the effect of 1997 financial crisis,
we divide the whole period into three sub period: Period 1 (1980:01-1988:12) in which
captures the first 1983 financial deregulation; Period 2 (1988:01-1996:12) in which
covers the second big 1988 financial deregulation; and Period 3 (1997:01-2001:12) which
include the 1997 financial crisis. In Chapter 5, we examine the role of Non Performing
Loans (NPL) in Indonesian monetary transmission mechanism following the
methodology employed in Chapter 4. In general, the results, both in Chapter 4 and 5,
indicate that monetary policy contraction is not effective in the short run (three months);
In the long run (60 months), money is super-neutral as proposed by Friedman (classical
view) for the whole observation; while the results across three periods indicates various
results in the short-run. Based on the results in Chapter 4 and 5, we investigate further
the way Indonesian monetary transmission operates by examining bank portfolio
behaviour across five groups of banks (foreign, mixed, private, regional and state banks)
in Chapter 6. This chapter focuses on the effect of monetary policy, third party funds and
NPL in affecting Indonesian banks behaviour toward loans and other liquidity assets,
such as Certificate Bank Indonesia (SBI) and inter bank call money for impact, interim
and total effects. We employ a dynamic mean-variance expected utility approach that
enables us to calculate the multiplier responses of the choice items to unit changes in
exogenous variables. The multiplier effects involve three kinds effects: impact (current),
interim (ensuing periods) and total (cumulative) multipliers. The econometric technique
employed in the estimation of this chapter is Full Information Maximum Likelihood
(FIML). The findings confirm that monetary policy has the greatest impact effects on the
banks' portfolios. In regard to the interim effects, all three factors affect those portfolios.
In the long run, however, the variable NPL has the greatest influence. Consequently, it
can be suggested that Bank Indonesia has to set prudential regulations on, and introduce
some stringent supervision of, the banks to reduce the hindrance to the transmission of its
monetary policy.

AB  - This paper establishes liquidity linkage between stock and Treasury bond markets. There is a lead-lag relationship between illiquidity of the two markets and bidirectional Granger causality. The effect of stock illiquidity on bond illiquidity is consistent with flight-to-quality or flight-to-liquidity episodes. Monetary policy impacts illiquidity. The evidence indicates that bond illiquidity acts as a channel through which monetary policy shocks are transferred into the stock market. These effects are observed across illiquidity of bonds of different maturities and are especially pronounced for illiquidity of short-term maturities. The paper provides evidence of illiquidity integration between stock and bond markets.

AU  - Scott, Alasdair M.
AB  - In this paper, stochastic simulations of the Reserve Bank of New Zealand's new macroeconomic model, FPS, are used to examine the issue of which price index monetary policy should stabilise in a small open economy. Under the class of policy rules considered, targeting a measure of domestic inflation, which does not include the direct effects of exchange rate movements on the price of imported goods, results in lower variability in real output, nominal interest rates, the exchange rate and domestic price inflation. The result is robust if direct exchange rate effects influence agents' expectations of generalised inflation and if the policy maker is uncertain about how direct exchange rate effects influence expectations. Tracing out efficient policy frontiers under the two alternative targets illustrates that for a given level of CPI variability, output variability can be significantly reduced by targeting domestic price inflation.

Central banks use tools such as interbank rate and exchange rate when pursuing their (monetary) policies. The selected tools affect economic variables differently. By using Turkish monthly data for the 1988:2-2008:2 period, this study suggests that pure policies (such as interbank rate only or exchange rate only) increase relative price variability more than mixed policies, where the monetary authorities use the above tools simultaneously. © 2009 Asian Network for Scientific Information.

TI  - Monetary Policy Under Flexible Exchange Rates: An Introduction to Inflation Targeting
AU  - Agénor, Pierre-Richard
AB  - December 2000 Inflation targeting is a flexible policy framework that allows a country's central bank to exercise some degree of discretion without putting in jeopardy its main objective of maintaining stable prices. In the past few years a number of central banks have adopted inflation targeting for monetary policy. Agénor provides an introduction to inflation targeting, with an emphasis on analytical issues and the recent experience of middle- and high-income developing countries (which have relatively low inflation to begin with and reasonably well-functioning financial markets). After presenting a formal analytical framework, Agénor discusses the basic requirements for inflation targeting and how such a regime differs from money and exchange rate targeting regimes. After discussing the operational framework for inflation targeting (including the price index to monitor, the time horizon, the forecasting procedures, and the role of asset prices), he examines recent experiences with inflation targets, providing new evidence on the convexity of the Phillips curve for six developing countries. His conclusions: Inflation targeting is a flexible policy framework that allows a country's central bank to exercise some degree of discretion without putting in jeopardy its main objective of maintaining stable prices. In middle- and high-income developing economies that can refrain from implicit exchange rate targeting, it can improve the design and performance of monetary policy compared with other policy approaches that central banks may follow. Not all countries may be able to satisfy the technical requirements (such as adequate price data, adequate understanding of the links between instruments and targets of monetary policy, and adequate forecasting capabilities), but such requirements should not be overstated. Forecasting capability can never be perfect, and sensible projections always involve qualitative judgment. More important, and often more difficult, is the task of designing or improving an institutional framework that would allow the central bank to pursue the goal of low, stable inflation while maintaining the ability to stabilize fluctuations in output. This paper--a product of the Economic Policy and Poverty Reduction Division, World Bank Institute--is part of a larger effort in the institute to understand the dynamics of monetary policy in developing countries.

AB  - Oil price shocks are the major source of economic instability in oil exporting countries, as well as Iran. Also the appropriate monetary policy can play an important role in decreasing these undesirable variations. In this paper, to investigate the optimal monetary policy rule after an oil price shock for the economy of Iran, a New Keynesian Multi sectors Dynamic Stochastic General Equilibrium framework model with emphasis on oil sector optimization and considering the subsidy of energy price, is designed. The model is estimated by a Bayesian method and then it is used to evaluate the effect of different monetary policy rules. Our main findings reveal that among three different monetary policy rules under consideration i.e. CPI inflation targeting, PPI inflation targeting and real exchange rate targeting in the 1367:1-1391:1 period, PPI inflation targeting policy rule is more effective in stabilizing the inflation. Moreover compare to other policy rules, It is accompanied by the lowest welfare losses.

TI  - Empirical Research on the International Spillover Effects of U.S. Monetary Policy and Their Impacts
AU  - Wu, Hong
AB  - Empirical research has shown that there were international spillover effects from the U.S. monetary policy to output level, net exports and price levels of each country, and the impact on prices in each country was of synchronous effect. The structural impulse response analysis showed that U.S. monetary policy could improve U.S. income and payment without damaging U.S. economic growth, but the shocks negatively affected the economic growth in the rest of the world. Hence, it’s important to pay close attention to the moral risks of U.S. monetary policy to evade the global shocks caused by the “benefit-itself-at-the-expense-of-others” polices of the American government. Besides these findings, U.S. monetary policy shocks affect China’s trade surplus fluctuations strongly. Based on this, we propose that the approaches of balancing China’s current account could be explored efficiently from the perspective of monetary policy.

AB  - The focus of this paper is to examine potential impacts of fiscal and monetary policies on stock market performance in Poland. Applying the GARCH model and based on a sample during 1999.Q2 to 2012.Q4, this paper finds that Poland’s stock market index is not affected by the ratio of government deficits or debt to GDP and is negatively influenced by the money market rate. The stock index and the ratio of M3 to GDP show a quadratic relationship with a critical value of 46.03%, suggesting that they have a positive relationship if the M3/GDP ratio is less than 46.03% and a negative relationship if the M3/GDP ratio is greater than 46.03%. Furthermore, Poland’s stock index is positively associated with industrial production and stock market performance in Germany and the U.S. and negatively affected by the nominal effective exchange rate and the inflation rate.

To that end, we use a global vector autoregressive (GVAR) model and employ shadow rates as a proxy for the monetary policy stance during normal and zero-lower-bound periods. We propose a new way of modelling euro area countries in a multi-country framework, accounting for joint monetary policy, and a novel approach to simultaneously identifying shocks. Our results show that in most euro area and CESEE countries prices adjust and output falls in response to a euro area monetary tightening, but with a substantial degree of heterogeneity.

TI  - Functioning and Effectiveness of Monetary Transmission Mechanisms: Turkey Applications
AU  - Erdogdu, Aylin
T2  - Journal of Finance and Bank Management
AB  - Central banks can achieve their objectives through a host of measures. Monetary policy decisions affect the economy in general and the price level in particular. The transmission mechanism can be characterised by parameters such as long maturity, economic variables and uncertain time lags. Therefore, it is difficult to predict the precise effect of monetary policy actions on economy and price level. Monetary policy is currently in the center of discussions about how to promote sustainable growth and low inflation. This study provides an overview of the transmission mechanisms of monetary policy, starting with the traditional interest rate channels, and it explains the operating principles of other asset pricing which are so-called credit channels. Monetary policies of central banks will be analyzed throughout this paper. Theoretical principles of monetary transmission channels are examined by investigating the effectiveness of these channels in terms of the relationships between monetary policies and economic realities. This is done in order to identify which monetary channels are actively working by utilizing vector auto regression model. This paper provides an overview of transmission mechanisms of monetary policy. The results of the vector auto regression model revealed that the traditional interest rate channels of the monetary transmission mechanism work actively in Turkey. It also indicates that the exchange rate channel does not play a decisive role at this level of production even though a significant effect on the general prices can be expressed through exchange rate channels. Observations suggested that stock quotes and credit channels are not working effectively.

AU  - Güntner, Jochen

AB  - Recent advances in the use of high-frequency external instruments to separate the signaling channel of monetary policy from exogenous interest rate changes have solved a number of puzzling responses to supposedly contractionary monetary policy shocks. We show that their effects on U.S. banks' balance sheets, asset markets, and economic activity hinge on the level of geopolitical risk at the time of the FOMC announcement. The S&P500 falls and credit spreads rise by more, while bank balance sheets contract, if geopolitical risk is above its sample median in the quarter or month of the shock. The state-dependent effects are due to a tightening of credit- and risk-related national financial conditions and imply that, while preparing its monetary policy decisions, the Board of Governors should also keep track of the geopolitical environment.

AB  - Oil is an important lifeline in our national economic development, and its price fluctuations also affect every field of the economy. With the rapid economic development, China's demand for oil has increased and the dependence on imported oil also on the increase. Therefore, the negative effect of high oil price on China's economy is growing up. In this paper, we apply the cointegration and error correction model to specifically measure the impact of oil price on the economy. The results show that there exist long-run equilibrium relationship between the oil price and the China's output, the consumer price index, the total amount of net exports and the monetary policy. Rising international oil price would cause the total amount of net exports and the real output to decline and the prices to ascend. Meanwhile, it would have a negative impact on the actual money supply.

This paper first provides evidence, based on the OPEC 1973 price hike, against the supply shock view, and then points to the low trend growth in agriculture as the main factor keeping India's food inflation high. It then presents a simple model of a two person (rich and poor), two commodity (food and non food) economy with rising food and falling nonfood prices. Simulation results show that GDP can go up while aggregate utility goes down. Simultaneously the GDP deflator (considered to be the general price level) falls relative to the consumer price index, a weighted average of the price index for the poor and rich. Accordingly it argues for a population weighted Consumer Price Index to be constructed and its inflation rate made the primary target of monetary policy, eschewing other inflation measures.

TI  - MONETARY POLICY IN SOUTH AFRICA: A VECM APPROACH
AU  - Hlongwane, Nyiko Worship
AU  - Daw, Olebogeng David
T2  - International Journal of Economics and Finance Studies
AB  - This study aims to analyse monetary policy's influence in South Africa by examining the effects of repo rates and inflation on economic development. The study makes use of annual time series data from 1966 to 2020. The study uses a VECM model and Granger causality tests to analyse the variables' short, long run, and causal relationships. The study revealed that actual interest rates had a modest positive correlation with economic growth in the short term but a significant negative correlation in the long run. M2 was found to negatively correlate with money supply, whereas M3 had a positive correlation in the short and long run. M1 has an inverse association with economic growth in South Africa in the short run but a positive link in the long run. As a result, the study suggests that the SARB must implement expansionary and contractionary monetary policies in the short and long run, respectively, to enhance South Africa's economic growth.

TI  - Optimal Monetary Policy and Nominal Exchange Rate Volatility under Local Currency Pricing
AU  - Okano, Eiji
AB  - We analyze the ﬂuctuation in inﬂation and nominal exchange rate under optimal monetary policy with local currency pricing, by developing a two-country model belonging to DSGE with local currency pricing and comparing ﬂuctuations under local currency pricing with ﬂuctuations under producer currency pricing. Although preceding DSGE literatures assuming producer currency pricing show that stabilizing domestic inﬂation is optimal from the view point of minimizing welfare costs, we show that completely stabilizing consumer price index inﬂation is optimal from that view point. In addition, we show that completely stabilizing consumer price index inﬂation is equivalent with completely stabilizing nominal exchange rate.

AU  - Djivre, Joseph
AU  - Ribon, Sigal
AB  - In this paper we examine the effect of monetary policy on the Israeli economy, and in particular on unemployment and the evolution of prices, for the period between 1990 and 1999, using the SVAR methodology. The four endogenous variables are the unemployment rate in deviations from its trend, the inflation rate, the Bank of Israel nominal interest rate and local-currency depreciation. We posit two models. In the first the identification restrictions imply that aggregate supply does not respond immediately to changes in aggregate demand, while in the second the aggregate supply response to demand shocks has been designed to have the maximum effect. The impulse response function analysis in both models indicates that an unexpected tightening of monetary policy is followed by a relatively fast slowdown in the inflation rate and a rise in the unemployment rate. This result differs from the findings in other empirical work concerning relatively large closed economies in which prices respond with a delay to policy changes, lagging behind the output response.

AB  - In this paper we provide new evidence of the transmission mechanism of monetary policy in Dominican Republic using a Structural Vector Autoregressive methodology where we incorporate carefully a set of constraints on contemporary relationships composed of domestic and external variables. Using the model, we estimate the responses of CPI inflation and GDP growth, as well as money demand and the real exchange rate, to exogenous movements in monetary policy. In quantitative terms, an innovation of monetary policy has an effect on growth from the second month and runs for one year. In the case of inflation, the effects begin to be observed from the fifth month after the monetary shock occurred, with an average duration of two years. These responses are in line with economic theory in qualitative terms, and we do not observe the existence of any of the economic puzzles.

AB  - This paper explores if economic uncertainty alters the macroeconomic influence of monetary policy. We consider several measures of U.S. economic uncertainty, and estimate their interaction effects with monetary policy shocks as identified through structural vector autoregressions. We find that monetary policy shocks affect economic activity considerably weaker when uncertainty is high, consistently with "real-options" effects suggested by models with non-convex adjustment costs. Investment responds two to five times weaker when uncertainty is in its upper instead of its lower decile. High U.S. uncertainty is associated with lower policy influence not only domestically, but in Canada too.

Our results suggest that taking into account the switching nature of the economy is important only in extreme cases.

We decompose changes in policy variables into exogenous and endogenous components in order to find a “clean” monetary policy indicator whose changes are mainly policy induced. Our main findings are twofold. First, the PBC's operating procedures have evolved over time; since about 2006, they have developed to a relatively stable regime. Second, its operating procedures are neither pure interest rate targeting nor pure reserves targeting, but a mixture. A set of indicators all contain information about the policy stance. Finally, we construct a new composite indicator of the overall policy stance.

T2  - Global Banking, Financial Markets and Crises
T3  - International Finance Review
AB  - We analyze the impact of monetary policy instruments on interbank lending rates and retail bank lending in China using an extended version of the model developed by Porter and Xu (2009). Unlike the central banks of advanced economies, the People’s Bank of China (PBoC) uses changes in the required reserve ratios and open market operations to influence liquidity in money markets and adjusts the regulated deposit and lending rates and loan targets to intervene in the retail deposit and lending market. These interventions prevent the interbank lending rate from signaling monetary policy stance and transmitting the effect of policy to the growth of bank loans. Since the global financial crisis, the PBoC’s monetary policy has gone through a full cycle. The combining effects of using different policy instruments simultaneously within a short period of time were quite effective in bringing the credit and money growth in line with its desired level. Most recently steps have been taken to speed up the interest rate liberalization. Effective July 2013, the PBoC removed the floors of the benchmark lending rates.

TI  - Monetary Policy and Price Stability
AU  - Labonte, Marc
AU  - Makinen, Gail E.
AB  - Monetary policy can be defined broadly as any policy relating to the supply of money. Since the main agency concerned with the supply of money is the nation's central bank, the Federal Reserve, monetary policy can also be defined in terms of the directives, policies, statements, and actions of the Federal Reserve, particularly those from its Board of Governors that have an effect on aggregate demand or national spending. The nation's financial press and markets pay particular attention to the pronouncements of the chairman of the Board of Governors, the nation's central banker. The reason for this attention is that monetary policy can have important effects on aggregate demand and through it on real Gross Domestic Product (GDP),unemployment, real foreign exchange rates, real interest rates, the composition of output, etc. It is paradoxical, however, that these important effects, to the extent that they occur, are essentially only short-run in nature. Over the longer run, the major effect of monetary policy is on the rate of inflation. Thus, while a more rapid rate of money growth may for a time stimulate the economy leading to a more rapid rate of real GDP growth and a lower unemployment rate, over the longer run these changes are undone and the economy is left with a higher rate of inflation. In some societies where high rates of inflation are endemic, more rapid rates of money growth fail to exercise any stimulating effect and are almost immediately translated into higher rates of inflation. Traditionally, two means have been used to measure the posture of monetary policy. Since monetary policy involves the Federal Reserve's contribution to aggregate demand or money spending, it would be logical to examine the growth rate of the money supply. A growing money supply is important for the subsequent growth in money spending or aggregate demand. Giving empirical content to the abstract concept of "the supply of money" has not been easy. For the United States, three different collections of assets have been defined as "money" and labelled M1, M2,and M3. Unfortunately, over the period 1990-2004 these aggregates have not been consistently linked to money spending and, consequently, they are not the major focus of monetary policy. Rather, the Federal Reserve executes monetary policy by setting a target for an overnight interest rate called the federal funds rate. Low or falling rates are usually taken as a sign of monetary ease; high or rising rates usually indicate monetary tightness. Changes in the federal funds rates affect primarily short-term interest rates, and through these changes, money spending. The book then looks more closely at five economies that have adopted a price stability goal: New Zealand (which was the first country to adopt targeting), Canada, the United Kingdom, Sweden, and the Euro area. One key finding from these case-studies is that, in practice, central banks tend to operate with greater latitude and more discretion than some targeting proponents may have envisioned. For example, central banks still tend to respond to a decline in economic activity by lowering interest rates, even though strict attention to the target might not justify it. This is possible because exceptions to the targets are granted for a variety of shocks and the definition of inflation being targeted often excludes price changes due to factors such as food, energy, and excise taxes. The book concludes with a brief analysis of the record of inflation targeting in the developing world. It finds that the improvement in economic performance following the adoption of inflation targeting is greater in the developing world. Since developing world countries often experience economic and political instability.

AB  - This chapter explores the relationship between intergovernmental transfer and various types of spending at the local level. By international standards, the extent of intergovernmental transfer in Indonesia is quite high. Policies of fiscal decentralization that heavily use intergovernmental transfer are considered a second-best approach. This is given that the premise of high accountability of a decentralized system required both expenditure autonomy as well as tax autonomy. Intergovernmental transfers from the central government to provinces cover around 40-50 per cent of total provinces revenues, while in the case of local governments, the share of intergovernmental transfers on total local government revenues is more than 80 per cent. Intergovernmental transfers become a dominant source of revenues to both provinces and local governments given it is a chosen policy following up functional assignments across the level of governments that gives more authority to lower-level governments. DAU have positive effect both on capital and routine expenditures.

T2  - International Journal of Strategic Property Management
AB  - Monetary policy on real estate investment in China has had varying impacts across the country due to regional differences. A supply-determined model is used to measure the policy effects on property investment volume based on a set of regional data from 2003 to 2010. This research yields several important findings contributing to an understanding of uneven policy effects on the unbalanced regional markets. Firstly, it is revealed that the eastern coastal provinces in China have a higher dependence on bank loans for housing investment than that of the other inland provinces. Secondly, this research has disentangled the specific transmission channels of monetary policy in the property market. Bank loan supply, instead of interest rates, would be a potentially effective policy tool for the government in making property market adjustment. Thirdly, the eastern coastal provinces are more sensitive in their responses to the changes of monetary stances than the other non-coastal central and western provinces. Therefore, the government must take note of the significant heterogeneity arising from the regional differences in estimating the policy impacts, although monetary policy is uniformly employed in the nation most of the time.

The model focuses on the linkage between financial and real sectors and explicitly incorporates the transmission channel of monetary policy into the supply side of the economy via the real costs of working capital ('(‘avallo-effect”). The econometric evidence presented here shows the relevance of this effect. Simulation runs with the model based on the estimated parameter values show strong stagflationary effects of restrictive monetary policy in the short run because of this transmission channel.

AB  - This paper examines the effect of domestic monetary policy on capital flows after controlling for the effect of conventional push factors (global factors). We conduct a time-varying coefficient vector autoregressive (TVC-VAR) model analysis using monthly data (January 2010–July 2019) from Korea. Our empirical results show that an expansionary monetary policy shock has a short-run (1- and 3-month) negative impact on gross inflows to the equity market, which is the main driver of gross capital inflows to Korea. This negative effect increases throughout the sample period. Monetary policy easing is also associated with a decrease in outflows of equity, representing a reversal of Korean residents’ foreign equity investment as the domestic policy rate decreases. This effect dampens the negative impact on gross capital inflows, which leads to mild responses of net capital inflows in the short run. We also find a clear relationship between the level of the policy rate and its impact on gross capital inflows. The lower the policy rate, the greater the negative impact of the expansionary monetary policy shock on gross capital inflows. This time-varying effect reflects difficulties that many emerging market economies, including Korea, face in setting monetary policy when policy rates are low.

It is generally accepted that contractionary monetary shocks affect total consumption, employment and total output negatively. However, the leading position of countries’ properties (socio-economic, political etc.) on the relationship between real variables and monetary variables, create a debate among economists and ratify to make them precise evidence. The main aim of this paper is to analyze the effectiveness of narrow credit view on employment and output for Turkey. Within this framework, money supply, total loans, employment rates and industrial production index monthly variables are analyzed for the period of 2005-2010 by using VAR method. The results indicate that changes in money stock (m2) have an impact on real variables such as employment and output through credit stock.

AB  - The I Theory of Money argues that price stability and financial stability, and hence monetary policy and financial
stability policy, are inseparable. But monetary policy and financial stability policy are different and distinct, in the
sense that they have different objectives and different suitable instruments, even when the same authority is in
charge of both. As is the case for fiscal policy and monetary policy, in normal times monetary and financial
stability policies are most likely best conducted independently, but with each taking the conduct of the other
policy into account. Sweden provides a bad example of aggressive leaning against the wind, with high costs in
terms of excessively low inflation, overly high unemployment and a higher real debt burden for households.

TI  - The effects of conventional and unconventional monetary policy on exchange rates
AU  - Inoue, Atsushi

T2  - Journal of International Economics
AB  - What are the effects of monetary policy on exchange rates? And have unconventional monetary policies changed the way monetary policy is transmitted to international financial markets? According to conventional wisdom, expansionary monetary policy shocks in a country lead to that country's currency depreciation. We revisit the conventional wisdom during both conventional and unconventional monetary policy periods in the US by using a novel identification procedure that defines monetary policy shocks as changes in the whole yield curve due to unanticipated monetary policy moves and allows monetary policy shocks to differ depending on how they affect agents' expectations about the future path of interest rates as well as their perceived effects on the riskiness/uncertainty in the economy. Our empirical results show that: (i) a monetary policy easing leads to a depreciation of the country's spot nominal exchange rate in both conventional and unconventional periods; (ii) however, there is substantial heterogeneity in monetary policy shocks over time and their effects depend on the way they affect agents' expectations; (iii) we find favorable evidence to Dornbusch's (1976) overshooting hypothesis; (iv) changes in expected real interest rates play an important role in the transmission of monetary policy shocks.

TI  - Unconventional Monetary Policy and Economic Inequality
AU  - Davtyan, Karen
AB  - This paper evaluates the distributional effects of US unconventional monetary policy. The results show that balance sheet policies tend to be the key measures that shape its overall effects. Unconventional monetary policy reduces the unemployment rate, moderately increases prices, and stabilizes financial conditions. Yet, it raises capital income more than labor earnings. This impact leads to the relatively higher increase in income at the upper part of distribution, resulting in the growth of income inequality. Also, unconventional monetary policy increases stock prices more than house prices. This effect results in the relatively larger growth of wealth at the top of distribution, leading to the rise of wealth inequality. The impact of unconventional monetary policy on wealth inequality is particularly strong.

TI  - Eﬀectiveness of monetary policy in stabilising food inﬂation: Evidence from advanced and emerging economies
AU  - Bhattacharya, Rudrani
AB  - In the backdrop of several episodes of high and volatile food inﬂation in emerging economies, a wealth of literature emphasises on broad range of monetary and exchange rate policies to stabilise food inﬂation by moderating demand pressure. While the theoretical literature mainly focus on welfare-maximising monetary policy, there exists hardly any empirical consensus on eﬀectiveness of monetary policy to stabilise food inﬂation. Very recently, a limited strand of empirical literature has attempted to shed light in this arena. The present study attempts to contribute in this literature by analysing eﬀectiveness of monetary policy shock to stabilise food inﬂation in a panel of developed and emerging economies. We ﬁnd that an unexpected monetary tightening has a positive and signiﬁcant eﬀect on food inﬂation in both advanced and emerging economies. Our ﬁndings suggest that in the backdrop of inﬂationary pressure stemming from the food sector, a monetary tightening may turn out to be destabilising for the food as well as overall inﬂation in the economy.

TI  - The Effects of Monetary Policy on Prices in Malawi
AU  - Mangani, Ronald
AB  - Evidence on the transmission mechanism of monetary policy is quite non-uniform,
particularly across countries with different economic structures. Complications to
theoretical propositions tend to arise when economies are less market-oriented and
less sensitive to policy interventions, when monetary authorities are not adequately
independent, or when market-based and administrative policy instruments are used
concurrently. It is important, therefore, to appreciate the unique dynamics of the
transmission mechanism in any jurisdiction, in order to understand and possibly
predict the macroeconomic effects of monetary policy. This study assessed the effects
of monetary policy in Malawi by tracing the channels of its transmission mechanism,
while recognizing several factors that characterize the economy: market imperfections,
fiscal dominance and vulnerability to external shocks. Within the environment of
vector autoregressive modelling, Granger-causality and block exogeneity tests as
well as innovation accounting analyses were conducted to describe the dynamic
interrelationships among monetary policy, financial variables and prices. The study
established the lack of unequivocal evidence in support of a conventional channel of
the monetary policy transmission mechanism, and found that the exchange rate was
the most important variable in predicting prices. Therefore, the study recommends
that authorities should be more concerned with imported cost-push inflation rather
than demand-pull inflation. In the short term, pursuing a prudent exchange rate policy
that recognizes the country’s precarious foreign reserve position could be critical in
deepening domestic price stability. Beyond the short term, price stability could be
sustained through the implementation of policies directed towards building a strong
foreign exchange reserve base, as well as developing a sustainable approach to the
country’s reliance on development assistance.

TI  - Monetary Policy and Borrowers’ Loan Defaults: Research Based on Data from Renrendai
AU  - Song, Wenda
AU  - Zhang, Haiyang
T2  - China & World Economy
AB  - This paper uses Renrendai data to study the relationship between monetary policy and the default behavior of borrowers, and analyzes the transmission channels. The research shows that tight monetary policy will lead to a significant increase in a borrower's probability to default, and this effect will continue for several months. There may be two transmission channels: (i) monetary policy changes a debtor's liquidity through credit and balance sheet channels, which directly affects their current repayment behavior; and (ii) monetary policy may affect a borrower's investment, production and profitability, thus changing their long-term solvency. The paper also finds that the repayment behavior of productive borrowers is more susceptible to monetary policy than consumptive borrowers, and that the default behavior of borrowers in coastal provinces is more susceptible to monetary policy than of borrowers in inland provinces. These findings provide new evidence for understanding how monetary policy affects individual behavior and its transmission mechanisms.

AB  - This study empirically examined the impact of monetary policy rate (MPR) on some selected macroeconomic variables such as real gross domestic product (RGDP), inflation proxy by consumer price index (CPI) and exchange rate (EXR) in Nigeria using quarterly data spanning from 2008Q1 to 2019Q4. The preliminary test result for both Augmented Dickey Fuller (ADF) and Philip perron (PP) revealed that the data are all stationary after first difference. The study employed Autoregressive Distributed lag (ARDL) model and Toda-Yamamoto granger causality. The ARDL used to test whether there is a long run relationship between the variables under study while Toda-Yamamoto granger causality used to examine the impact of MPR on the selected macroeconomic variables in Nigeria. The result of the finding shows that there is long run relationship between MPR and RGDP, CPI and EXR. but the impact of MPR on macroeconomic variables is more in the long run than in the short run; the result of Toda-Yamamoto causality indicates that MPR have little or no significant impact on the macroeconomic variables in Nigeria. The result shows that monetary policy shows the moderate impact on the selected macroeconomic variables in Nigeria. This means that if MPC plays their role of proper implementation of MPR, MPR would have a higher impact on the selected variables in the study. So if MPR did not achieve the desired goal it’s implied that MPC is fooling MPR. The study recommends that Government should make sure that the monetary policy rate which is the beach-mark rate should strictly be implemented to achieve, the macroeconomic objective of price stability, stable exchange rate, stable economic growth, full employment, and balance of payment equilibrium.

TI  - Effects of Monetary Policy on Inflation Rate in Kenya
AU  - Njiru, Anne W.
AB  - Despite the embracing of monetary policies by developing countries, most of them still find themselves entrenched in a never-ending cycle of inflation. The cycles of inflations end up destroying counties’ pride, and to some extent, their sovereignty monetary policy actions are followed by movements in real output that may last for two years or more. Monetary transmission mechanism has been a subject of much research over a number of years. This study, therefore sought to determine the effects of monetary policy on inflation in Kenya. The study adapted descriptive survey approach in collecting data from the respondents. The descriptive survey method was preferred because it ensures complete description of the situation, making sure that there was minimum bias in the collection of data and finding out the what, where and how of a phenomenon. This study used secondary data for the specific variables which are inflation, money supply, 91 day-Treasury bill rate and foreign exchange rate. The data on inflation (CPI) was obtained from KNBS while data on 91-day Treasury bill rate, exchange rate and money supply (M3) was obtained from the CBK website which it is public data. The study concluded that there was a positive correlation between inflation rate and the independent variables. In addition, the study concluded that the 91 day T Bills Rate is the main influencer of the inflation rates in Kenya. This is because it represents the risk free investment for investors. In the second place is the money supply. In addition the study concluded that all the variables (91-Day Treasury bill rate, exchange rates and money supply) considered together influence the inflation rate by only 26.1%.The study concluded that monetary policies affect inflation rates. This is because through the monetary policy tools, the monetary Committee influences the amount of money in circulation. The study concluded that the 91 day T Bills Rate is the main influencer of the inflation rates in Kenya. This is because it represents the risk free investment for investors. In the second place is the money supply.

TI  - Monetary policy, firm heterogeneity, and product variety
AU  - Zanetti, F.
AU  - Hamano, M.
AB  - This study provides new insights on the allocative effect of monetary policy. It shows that contractionary monetary policy exerts a non-trivial reallocation effect by cleansing unproductive firms and enhancing aggregate productivity. At the same time, however, reallocation involves a reduction in the number of product variety that is central to consumer preferences and hurts welfare. A contractionary policy prevents the entry of new firms and insulates existing firms from competition, reducing aggregate productivity. Under demand uncertainty, the gain of the optimal monetary policy diminishes in firm heterogeneity and increases in the preference for product variety. We provide empirical evidence on US data, which corroborates the relevance of monetary policy for product variety that results from firm entry and exit, and provides limited support to the cleansing effect of monetary policy.

TI  - The Effectiveness of Unconventional Monetary Policy on Risk Aversion and Uncertainty
AU  - Rompolis, Leonidas
AB  - This paper examines the impact of unconventional monetary policy of ECB measured by its balance sheet expansion on euro area equity market uncertainty and investors risk aversion within a structural VAR framework. An expansionary balance sheet shock decreases both risk aversion and uncertainty at least in the medium-run. A negative shock on policy rates has also a negative impact on risk aversion and uncertainty. These results are generally robust to different specifications of the VAR model, estimation procedures and identification schemes. Conversely, periods of high uncertainty are followed by a looser conventional monetary policy. The effect of uncertainty on ECB’s total assets and of risk aversion on conventional or unconventional monetary policy is not always statistically significant.

AB  - Monetary transmission mechanism assumed to be significantly influenced by the effect of policy decisions on financial markets. However, various previous studies have come up with different outcomes. The purpose of this study is to examine the impact of monetary policy on different asset classes (shares and bonds) in Pakistan. This study using stock price and bond yield as dependent variable and discount rate, money supply, inflation, and exchange rate are independent variables. Data of all variables have collected from 2010 to 2016, and Vector Autoregressive (VAR) technique has applied. The empirical results indicate that there is an impact of monetary policy components on both stock and bond market as an increase in policy rate causes decline in stocks prices and bonds yields. The findings of this study will help the potential investors in making long-term (in general) and short-term (in particular) investment strategies concerning monetary policy.

AB  - The headwinds of the financial crisis have threatened the attainment of macroeconomic stability. As result, policymakers were confronted with finding the right policy mix that will ensure price stability, financial stability, and long-run growth. This paper contributes to the discussion by investigating the impact of simultaneous usage of monetary and macro-prudential policies in Central and Eastern Europe using a dynamic panel framework. Findings show that while an expansionary innovation to macro-prudential policy increases the loan-to-value ratio, and accelerates the credit-to-GDP gap, a contractionary shock to monetary policy hiked the policy interest rate, which depresses price inflation and economic activity. In terms of pass-through effects, property prices fell amid macro-prudential expansion and monetary tightening (no wealth effect was found).
