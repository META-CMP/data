TI  - INFLATION TARGETING AND MONETARY POLICY RULES FOR SMALL AND OPEN DEVELOPING ECONOMIES: SIMPLE ANALYTICS WITH APPLICATION TO THAILAND
AU  - Cavoli, Tony
AU  - Rajan, Ramkishen
AB  - This paper uses a simple stylized macro model to examine the case for
and operational mechanics behind an open inflation targeting (IT)
arrangement which has increasingly been advocated for small and open
developing economies in Asia and elsewhere. The model is calibrated to
Thailand, which was among the first Asian country to implement an IT
arrangement. The numerical investigations are aimed at comparing
conventional optimal monetary policy under commitment and discretion
and the variations of the simple fixed MPRs (i.e. versions of “Taylor
Rules”). The simple MPRs we will examine differ in how much the real
exchange rate is represented in the rule. Will the general philosophy
behind IT be suitable for small and open developing economies in Asia?
Are some rules better than others? These are some of questions we
attempt to explore in this paper.

AB  - The study takes a first step in investigating the monetary transmission mechanism in Pakistan at a sectoral level in relation with business cycles. The key objective of the study is to empirically investigate the impact of monetary shocks on output of major sectors. Using VAR approach on quarterly data spanning from 1990:1 to 2012:4, we examine whether monetary policy shocks have different sectoral effects. We also incorporated business cycles to analyze weather sectoral effects of monetary policy undergone any changes during different phases of business cycles. Results obtained from VAR framework confirm the presence of sector-specific variation in the real effects of monetary policy. Our results also suggest that variation in output is more interest sensitive in recovery as compared to recessionary time periods. The results, therefore, seem to confirm potential disparities in the effect of monetary policy on real sectoral activities. It is a very unique contribution in empirical literature while at the same time it is a valuable input for accessing monetary policy implications for real sector growth in Pakistan.

TI  - The Nexus between Financial Inclusion and Monetary Policy: The Case Study of Selected ASEAN Countries

T2  - Journal of Economics, Business, & Accountancy Ventura
AB  - This study examines the relationship between financial inclusion and monetary policy in nine selected ASEAN (Association of Southeast Asian Nations) countries during 2010-2019. To answer the objective of this study, the Vector Error Correction Model (VECM) is used to analyze the effect of financial inclusion on inflation. In addition, the causality between financial inclusion and monetary policy is also examined in this study. The data used are panels data. The multidimensional approach of IFI (index of financial inclusion) is constructed to represent a comprehensive financial inclusion measurement. The results showed that financial inclusion had a negative effect on inflation in the long-term and short-term; it indicates that an increase in financial inclusion will lower inflation which eventually increases the effectiveness of monetary policy in Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand, Philippines, Singapore, Vietnam, Cambodia, Myanmar, and Laos. Moreover, a causality exists between financial inclusion indicators and monetary policy in selected ASEAN countries. This study concludes that financial inclusion through access and usage of financial services improves the efficiency of monetary policy in nine selected ASEAN countries in controlling inflation. This study suggests that monetary authorities must emphasize the link between financial inclusion and monetary policy objectives. Advanced financial inclusion can help policymakers formulate and implement monetary policies contributing to economic stability and sustainable growth.

AB  - This paper investigates the effects of monetary policy in China over the past two decades with a typical emphasis on the post-Asian crisis period and the more recent currency regime shift. A Factor-Augmented VAR method is used to study the effectiveness of monetary policy instruments in stabilizing the Chinese economy. We find that the repo rate, benchmark lending rate and a market-based monetary stance are mildly effective while the growth rates of total loan and of money supply are significantly effective. Moreover, the effectiveness of the market-based monetary policies does not improve under a more flexible exchange rate regime. It is concluded that the central bank in China still depend on the administrative instruments in stabilizing domestic inflation, and thereby maintaining macroeconomic and financial stability.

AB  - We develop a VAR that allows the estimation of the impact of monetary policy shocks on volatility. Estimates for the US suggest that an increase in the policy rate by 1% is associated with a rise in unemployment and inflation volatility of about 15%. Using a New Keynesian model, with search and matching labour frictions and Epstein-Zin preferences we show that these volatility effects are driven by the coexistence of agents' fears of unemployment and concerns about the (in) ability of the monetary authority to reverse deviations from the policy rule with the impact magnified by the agents' preferences.

TI  - Learning About Monetary Policy Rules in Small Open Economies
AU  - Llosa, Luis-Gonzalo
AU  - Tuesta Reátegui, Vicente
AB  - We evaluate the expectational stability (E-stability) of rational expectations equilibrium in a simple "New Keynesian" small open economy model. In particular, we extend Bullard and Mitra (JME, 2002) results of E-stability in closed economy to an open economy framework by evaluating Taylor-type rules. The main results are the following: a) the stability conditions under learning in open economies are isomorphic to the closed economy counterpart when the central bank targets contemporaneously either domestic price inflation or CPI inflation; b) the problem of instability under learning becomes more serious in open economies when the central bank reacts actively to expected consumer price inflation (CPI). Thus, unlike Bullard and Mitra (2002) the Taylor's principle does not necessarily induce both determinate and learnable rational expectation equilibria, where the degree of openness plays a crucial role c) it is easier for the economy to get into an unstable region when a central bank reacts to expected movements in the exchange rate along with an actively reaction to expected CPI inflation.

TI  - Effects of Monetary Policy in a Fixed Exchange Rate Regime: Tranquil and Turbulent States
AU  - Stroud, Jonathan R.
AU  - Zhou, Hang
AB  - This paper evaluates monetary policy effects in a fixed exchange rate regime. A fixed exchange rate regime sometimes suffers from turbulence, owing to speculative attacks or other factors that significantly change the expectations of maintaining such a regime. We, therefore, develop a vector autoregression model with a jump processes to evaluate monetary policy in both tranquil and turbulent states. We find that a contractionary monetary policy shock in the tranquil period only affects the exchange rate in the very short run. Nonetheless, the shock significantly reduces the price level and industrial production, especially for a credible peg with a wider band. During the turbulent period, the exchange rate is kept stable for one quarter when facing the same shock—while industrial production drops significantly. The findings, also shed light on the cost of successful defense of speculative attacks.

TI  - Macroeconomic effects of monetary policy in the Eurozone
AU  - Varela, Matilde de Vasconcellos Morais
AB  - To study the macroeconomic effects of unconventional monetary policy across
the different countries of the eurozone, I develop an identification scheme to disentangle conventional from non-conventional policy shocks, using futures contracts on overnight interest rates and the size of the European Central Bank balance sheet.
Setting these shocks as endogenous variables in a structural vector autoregressive
(SVAR) model, along with the CPI and the employment rate, estimated impulse response functions of policy to macroeconomic variables are studied.
I find that unconventional policy shocks generated mixed effects in inflation but
had a positive impact on employment, with the exception of Portugal, Spain, Greece
and Italy where the employment response is close to zero or negative. The heterogeneity
that characterizes the responses shows that the monetary policy measures taken in recent years were not sufficient to stabilize the economies of the eurozone countries under more severe economic conditions.

AB  - The aim of our paper is to investigate the potential asymmetric effects of monetary policy shocks on U.S. economic activity. For that matter, we focus on the business cycle phase in which the shock occurs. We then propose a natural extension of the structural VAR methodology and of its analysis tools to a nonlinear framework. The identification strategy of shocks we adopt is the one proposed by Sims and Zha (1998). At this stage, our findings reveal that a contractionary money supply shock yields asymmetric responses of output, prices and money.

TI  - Financial Frictions and Optimal Monetary Policy in an Open Economy
AU  - Kolasa, Marcin
AU  - Lombardo, Giovanni
AB  - A growing number of papers have studied positive and normative implications of financial frictions in DSGE models. We contribute to this literature by studying the welfare-based monetary policy in a two-country model characterized by financial frictions, alongside a number of key features, like capital accumulation, non-traded goods and foreign-currency debt denomination. We compare the cooperative Ramsey monetary policy with standard policy benchmarks (e.g. PPI stability) as well as with the optimal Ramsey policy in a currency area. We show that the two-country perspective offers new insights on the trade-offs faced by the monetary authority. Our main results are the following. First, strict PPI targeting (nearly optimal in our model if credit frictions are absent) becomes excessively procyclical in response to positive productivity shocks in the presence of financial frictions. The related welfare losses are non-negligible, especially if financial imperfections interact with non-tradable production. Second, (asymmetric) foreign currency debt denomination affects the optimal monetary policy and has important implications for exchange rate regimes. In particular, the larger the variance of domestic productivity shocks relative to foreign, the closer the PPI-stability policy is to the optimal policy and the farther is the currency union case. Third, we find that central banks should allow for deviations from price stability to offset the effects of balance sheet shocks. Finally, while financial frictions substantially decrease attractiveness of all price targeting regimes, they do not have a significant effect on the performance of a monetary union agreement.

TI  - VARMA models for Malaysian Monetary Policy Analysis
AU  - Raghavan, Mala

AU  - Silvapulle, Param
AB  - This paper establishes vector autoregressive moving average (VARMA) models for Malaysian monetary policy analysis by efﬁciently identifying and simultaneously estimating the model parameters using full information maximum likelihood. The monetary literature is largely dominated by vector autoregressive (VAR) and structural vector autoregressive (SVAR) models, and to the best of our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst paper to use VARMA modelling to investigate monetary policy. Malaysia is an interesting small open economy to study because of the capital control measures imposed by the government following the 1997 Asian ﬁnancial crisis. A comparison of the impulse responses generated by these three models for the pre- and post-crisis periods indicates that the VARMA model impulse responses are consistent with prior expectations based on economic theories and policies pursued by the Malaysian government, particularly in the post-crisis period. Furthermore, uncovering the way in which various intermediate channels work would help Bank Negara Malaysia to steer the economy in the right direction so that monetary policy can still remain an effective policy measure in achieving sustainable economic growth and price stability.

AB  - This paper studies how endogenous firm entry affects the responses of the economy to the monetary policy, cost-push and demand shocks. Opposite to the earlier literature we assume also that firm default rate is not constant but subject to exogenous shocks. We show that increased bankruptcies have long-standing negative effect on output and positive effect on inflation. This raises the question how monetary policy should react to the variability in business defaults. Based on our simulations we propose two alternative monetary policy rules, which give lower variance than the traditional Taylor rule which reacts to inflation and consumption.

T2  - The Journal of Internet Banking and Commerce
AB  - Over the years, the manufacturing sector has responded relatively low compared to other sectors such as services, agriculture, crude petroleum and natural gas despite its huge potential and various policies proposed towards a growth in the sector. This study investigated the effect of monetary policy on the manufacturing sector output in Nigeria using a quarterly data from 1981 to 2015 employing the structural vector autoregressive(SVAR) framework. An eight variable SVAR for manufacturing sector output was employed. The study examined the effect of monetary policy using the four monetary transmission mechanism channels and included a fiscal policy variable as well as labor and capital in the model. The short-run SVAR showed that only monetary policy rate and money supply conformed to theory. The impulse response functions showed that all monetary variables as well as other variables with the exception of government expenditure conformed to economic theory. One major finding of the study is that the lending interest rate accounted for the biggest variance in the manufacturing contribution to gross domestic product as shown by the forecast error variance decomposition. The study recommends that the monetary authority should ensure that the lending interest rate to the manufacturing sector is within a single digit, accessible, affordable and sustainable so as to ensure a greater productivity in the sector

To this end, we use structural panel vector autoregressions and a dataset covering 32 advanced and emerging economies. We find that positive credit shocks are generally met with tighter macroprudential policy. Moreover, whereas macroprudential policy shocks mostly affect residential investment and household credit, monetary policy shocks have more widespread effects on the economy. We also show that macro-financial country characteristics such as the exchange rate regime and the level of financial development affect both the policy response to credit shocks and the macroeconomic effects of macroprudential policy.

TI  - THE EFFECTS OF MONETARY POLICY ON STOCK MARKET RETURNS AND VOLATILITY: EVIDENCE FROM SOUTH AFRICA - ProQuest
AB  - For several decades finance professionals have debated on the effects of monetary policy
variables on stock returns. This article examines the extent to which stock returns are linked to
interest rate and exchange rate in South Africa from 1995 to 2019, using OLS and GARCH (1,1).
Some unanticipated results were uncovered, ultimately contributing to the existing body of
literature and illustrating how different markets respond to different stimuli. The most substantial
was the significant positive relationship between stock returns and interest rates. A relationship
that can be explained by the Keynesian hypothesis based on a sticky price model. In line with
theory results revealed a negative and significant relationship between exchange rates and stock
market price returns. Also, the study revealed a positive and significant relationship between stock
returns volatility and interest rates. However, exchange rates only exhibited a significant positive
relationship under the OLS methodology for the JSE All-Share Index return volatility. This study
may assist stock market regulating authorities, monetary policy authorities and other stock market
participants in understanding the effects of monetary policy variable on stock returns. Further
research may dwell on the causality and cointegrating relationships as deterministic relationship
may not be dependable for policy formulation and forecasting.

T2  - Iranian Economic Review
AB  - This paper aims at investigating the effectiveness of monetary policy and the role of money in enhancing the economic growth and achieving the economic stability in Jordan. Therefore, this study uses quarterly time-series data for Jordan over the period 1992Q1 - 2019Q4 to estimate a reduced form model. The study variables are stationary at the first difference as indicated by Augmented Dickey-Fuller and Phillips-Perron unit root tests. Granger Causality test also revealed the existence of unidirectional causality running from money to the real output, and bidirectional causality between the real output and prices level. Johansen cointegration test clarified the existence of only one cointegrating relationship in the long-run. Moreover, applying Fully Modified OLS and Vector Error Correction models for estimation emphasized the significant positive short and long-run impact of money on the real GDP in Jordan, rejecting the hypothesis of neutrality of money in the long-run. The adjustment coefficient is 42% indicating that 42% of the previous quarter deviation from long-run equilibrium is corrected in the current quarter. Based on these outcomes the study recommends to improve the management of monetary authority, and focus on developing the domestic money and capital markets and their instruments, in order to sustain and strengthen the role of monetary policy in the Jordanian economy. It is also recommended that the fiscal and monetary policies should be designed to be complementary to each other rather than rivals.

AB  - Abstract. Raising social standards is an essential instrument of social policy by the state. However, the decision to raise the minimum wage rather sharply should consider its impact on fiscal and monetary policy.
The article aims to study how government decisions on social standards (in particular minimum wages) can influence monetary policy decisions based on inflation targeting.
Results of the research. The method of analysis of indicators and consequences of the introduction of inflation targeting in Ukraine, geographical neighbors and countries with similar economies is described. It is determined that the final effect of changes in social standards on inflation depends on the entire transmission mechanism, which includes several interrelated reactions, and maybe stretched over time, depending on both the speed of transmission of the impulse and the specifics of institutional regulation.
It is established that the criterion for a dramatic increase in the minimum wage is a significant upward shift of the minimum wage to the average wage ratio curve. In this case, as we have shown, inflation expectations worsen, which modifies somewhat the behaviour of economic agents and is transferred to current inflation rates in the future. Raising social standards is a good decision of the government in order to maintain household incomes. However, to ensure the neutrality of such a decision for fiscal and monetary policy, it needs to be aligned with its objectives and strategies.
Keywords: social standards, monetary policy, inflation targeting, minimum wage, GDP, government.

TI  - Monetary policy and anxious presidents: The effects of monetary shocks on presidential job approval
AU  - Adra, Samer
T2  - Politics & Policy
AB  - Abstract Using high-frequency identification, I show that the Federal Reserve significantly influences its political environment. A 50-bp exogenous contractionary monetary shock is associated with a decline in the U.S. president's job approval by up to five percentage points in the subsequent 12 to 24 months. This loss exceeds the victory margin in six out of the eight latest elections. My findings also suggest that presidents who are in the second half of their terms are particularly vulnerable to monetary shocks. Such vulnerability is largely explained by the evolving attitudes toward key macroeconomic factors like unemployment and inflation over the presidential life cycle.

AB  - Past empirical research on monetary policy in open economies has found evidence of the ‘delayed overshooting puzzle’ and the ‘forward discount puzzle’. We revisit the effects of monetary policy on exchange rates by applying Uhlig's [Uhlig, H., 2005a. What are the effects of monetary policy on output? Results from an agnostic identification procedure. Journal of Monetary Economics 52(2), 381–419.] identification procedure that involves sign restrictions on the impulse responses of selected variables. In a first step, we leave the response of the exchange rate agnostically open and find sizeable evidence for both puzzles. In a second step, we additionally rule out the delayed overshooting by construction. Our results indicate that the forward discount puzzle is robust even without delayed overshooting.

T2  - Journal of Social Sciences
AB  - Generally, both fiscal and monetary policies seek at achieving relative macroeconomic stability. Based on countries’ experience on the role of monetary policy in controlling economics instability, this study examines the efficacy of monetary policy in controlling inflation rate and exchange rate instability. The analysis performed is based on a rational expectation framework that incorporates the fiscal role of exchange rate. Using quarterly data spanning over 1980: 1 to 2000: 4, and applying time series test on the data used, the paper shows that the effort of monetary policy at influencing the finance of government fiscal deficit through the determination of the inflation-tax rate affects both the rate of inflation and the real exchange rate, thereby causing volatility in their rates. The paper reveals that inflation affects volatility of its own rate, as well as the rate of real exchange. The policy import of the paper is that monetary policy should be set in such a way that the objective it is to achieve is well defined.

TI  - Monetary policy with non-separable government spending
AU  - Troug, Haytem
T2  - Journal of Applied Economics
AB  - The significant role of government consumption in affecting economic conditions raises the necessity for monetary policy to take into account the behaviour of fiscal policy and to also take into account how the presence of the fiscal sector might affect the transmission mechanism of monetary policy in the economy. To test for this, we build an otherwise standard New Keynesian model that incorporates non-separable government consumption. The simulations of the model show that when government consumption has a crowding-in effect on private consumption, it will dampen the transmission mechanism of monetary policy, and vice versa. The empirical estimations of the paper also support the theoretical findings of the model, as the panel regressions show that, in OECD countries, government consumption dampens the effect of the policy rate on private consumption. These results are robust to the zero lower bound era.

AB  - I investigate the nonlinear effects of monetary policy through differences in household debt across U.S. states. After constructing a novel indicator of inflation for the states, I compute state-specific monetary policy stances as deviations from an aggregate Taylor rule. I find that the effectiveness of monetary policy is curtailed during periods of large household debt imbalances. Moreover, a common U.S. monetary policy does not fit all; it may have asymmetric effects on the economic performance across states, particularly at times of high dispersion in the household debt imbalances, as it may have been the case around the Great Recession.

TI  - Foreign Currency Debt and Optimal Monetary Policy: Is There a Role for the Exchange Rate in Completing Markets?
AU  - Osorio-Rodríguez, Daniel
AB  - This paper characterizes the optimal monetary and exchange rate policy for a small open economy with an incomplete domestic ﬁnancial market. The existence of a domestic ﬁnancial market arises from the existence of different generations within the domestic economy. The source of market incompleteness is the inability of domestic generations to trade ﬁnancial claims other than a nominal, non-contingent security denominated in foreign currency. The decentralized equilibrium of the model features a tight relationship between the consumption of different generations and the aggregate debt-to-GDP ratio. The stabilization of this ratio therefore increases the degree of risk-sharing across generations. The optimal monetary policy rule arises from a tradeoff between the stabilization of the debt-to-GDP ratio and the traditional objectives of price and output gap stabilization. Given that debt is denominated in foreign currency, the former requires active control of the nominal exchange rate. For the calibration considered, price and output stabilization dominate risk-sharing in the optimal policy rule. This indicates that the objective of improving risk sharing is excessively costly from the point of view of the policymaker. The optimal policy rule is found to be closest to Producer Price Index Inﬂation Targeting than to Consumer Price Index Inﬂation Targeting or an Exchange Rate Peg. Finally, the model admits an extension of the result by Cole and Obstfeld[8, 1991] for risk-sharing across domestic households under ﬁnancial autarky.

With the emergence of online retail trade, dynamic pricing concepts were introduced which reduced menu costs and rendered price changes more frequent. Our two-sector New Keynesian model implies that the real effects of monetary policy abate as the share of online retail trade rises. These theoretical results are empirically confirmed by means of an interactive Bayesian VAR model using data for the Euro area. Our findings identify a structural rather than a cyclical phenomenon for diminished monetary policy effectiveness.

AB  - Is systematic monetary policy a driver of the forward premium puzzle, i.e. the tendency of high interest-rate currencies to appreciate, thus strongly violating Uncovered Interest Parity (UIP)? We address this question by studying a battery of monetary policy rules in a small open economy that is subject to stationary but persistent domestic and foreign shocks. Each rule leads to model-implied UIP violations, which we derive analytically and then calibrate numerically. Our key finding is that only a forward-looking rule based on CPI inflation can account for frequently observed strong UIP violations.

There is a novel monetary policy stance of the Turkish Central Bank (TCMB) from 2011 on, following the initiation of explicit inflation targeting in 2006. Within the framework financial stability is added to previous target of price stability and diversified interest rates and liquidity measures have been introduced as new tools along with classical short-term interest rate. Existence of interest channel has been tested by two causality methods, namely: Granger and Toda-Yamamoto. Results imply that interest channel is not operative in Turkey in the traditional and/or New Keynesian sense, but rather higher demand leads to higher prices (and vice versa) affecting interest rates in return. Findings do not comply with findings of the previous periods&#39; studies that interest rate channel is effective in Turkey.

TI  - Bank-Specific Characteristics and Monetary Policy Transmission: The Case of Italy
AU  - Gambacorta, Leonardo
AB  - This paper tests cross-sectional differences in the effectiveness of the bank lending channel of monetary policy in Italy from 1986 to 1998 using a panel approach. After a monetary tightening the decrease in deposits subject to reserve requirements is sharper for those banks that have less incentive to shield the effect of a monetary squeeze: small banks characterized by a higher ratio of deposits to loans and well-capitalized banks that have a greater capacity to raise other forms of external funds. As to lending, size does not affect the banks' reaction to a monetary policy impulse. This can be explained by a closer customer relationship, which provides an incentive for small banks, which are more liquid on average, to smooth the effects of a tightening on credit supplied. Banks' liquidity is the most significant factor enabling them to attenuate the effect of a decrease in deposits on lending.

AB  - The present paper assesses whether monetary policy effects are asymmetric over the business cycle by estimating a univariate model for GDP including additionally the first difference of the 3-month Austrian interest rate as a measure for monetary policy. The asymmetry of the effects is captured by allowing for state-dependent parameters where the latent state variable follows a Markov switching process. The model is estimated within a Bayesian framework using Markov Chain Monte Carlo simulation methods. Model selection and specification tests are performed by means of marginal likelihood. The results document significant negative effects of monetary policy during periods of below-average growth, while the effect seems insignificant during periods of normal or above-average growth. These results corroborate those derived in theoretical models assuming price rigidities and implying a convex supply curve. Additionally, the concern of using appropriate state-identifying restrictions is raised to obtain an unbiased posterior inference. Finally, the analysis concludes by assessing the robustness of the results with respect to alternative measures of monetary policy.

AB  - This paper combines a fiscal structural vector-autoregression (SVAR) with a monetary SVAR for the Polish transition economy. Data are constructed from scratch in order to account for features of the transition economy and for delays in implementing legislated government spending and tax changes (fiscal foresight). For monetary policy, we find no price puzzles in the combined SVAR. Also, fiscal foresight variables have no statistically significant effects. We calculate an initial government spending multiplier of 0.70, which later peaks at 1.61 for the cumulative multiplier. This multiplier is much larger than multipliers estimated in previous studies not combining fiscal and monetary policy, where they were found to be close to zero. On the other hand, the tax multiplier is generally near zero in our study. We demonstrate the importance of combining fiscal and monetary transmission mechanisms when assessing the effects of government macroeconomic policies.

TI  - Industry Impacts of Unconventional Monetary Policy
AU  - Goto, Eiji
AB  - While conventional monetary policy has been shown to create differential impacts on industry output, how unconventional monetary policy affects industries is not yet known. Conducting an industry level analysis provides insights of the relative response of industries, monetary transmission mechanisms, and the role of industry composition on the aggregate impact. This paper studies the effects of unconventional monetary policy on industry output in the United States, the United Kingdom, and Japan, three countries that have recently implemented unconventional monetary policy. I use a structural Bayesian vector autoregressive model with zero and sign restrictions to identify an unconventional monetary policy shock. The effects on output across industries within a country have substantial heterogeneity. For example, industry peak output responses in the United States vary from -0.01% to +0.35% in response to a one standard deviation shock to the central bank total asset. Industries across the three countries have some variation in output response to unconventional monetary policy, however, on average the effects are similar to conventional monetary policy. Furthermore, regression analysis shows that lower working capital is associated with a larger industry output response to unconventional monetary policy. The ﬁnding indicates the relevance of the interest rate channel to unconventional monetary policy while the policy rates adhere to the zero lower bound.

AB  - This study conducts a comparative analysis of the monetary policy transmission channels and their effects in Korea and Japan using a sign restriction VAR model to determine whether a Japanese-style monetary policy can be implemented in Korea. Results indicate considerable differences between Korea and Japan in their monetary policy transmission channels. Conventional monetary policy transmission channels, such as the exchange rate channel, asset price channel, and bank lending channel, works relatively well in Japan. However, in Korea, the interest rate channel is effective but has only a short-term effect on the exchange rate, and the effects on asset prices and bank lending are hard to expect in general. Furthermore, some potential risks working through the housing market may hinder financial stability. Korea and Japan see a limited effect on production in the real sector. These results imply that Korea must be careful about implementing a similar monetary policy as Japan.

His proposal is later adopted in Roosevelt's New Deal, which greatly help USA climb out of economy recession and achieve prosperity over 20 years.

On July 1 of that year, 4.866 billion treasure bills are issued by administrative distribution. In 1985, Real Estate Company of Shenyang issued 5-year bonds publicly and then started the issuance of corporate bonds. Some companies in big cities like Beijing, Shanghai, and Shenzhen followed its footsteps to raise fund by issuing bonds, and then, banks begin to issue financial bonds. Although corporate bonds go on fast track, the corresponding circulation market has not taken shape yet and thus severely hinders the improvement of bond issuance market.

Some of them are still staggering along the course of recovery until the moment. Its huge destructive impact arouses the attention of people around the world and how to prevent systemic financial risk thus becomes a focus of all governments. To this end, the USA establishes a dedicated Systemic Risk Council; European countries build another Systemic Risk Council based on the previous Banking Regulatory Bureau, Securities Regulatory Bureau, and Insurance Regulatory Bureau; Chinese central government emphasizes for many times that we should hold the line for any regional and systemic financial risks, and active research is taken in both theoretical circle and practical departments for constructing a coordinated regulatory framework in China. Besides, all the governments also conduct research based on risk measure, early warning, and other technical indicators. This chapter will explore and conduct empirical research on how to prevent systemic financial risks.

AB  - This study examined empirically the relationships between money, price and output in Nigeria. Time series data for monetary policy variables (BM, MPR, M1 and M2), Inflation (GDP deflator and CPI inflations) and real GDP was collected from Central Bank of Nigeria’s statistical bulletin from 1981:Q1 to 2013:Q4. The study was carried out in three folds: firstly, the estimation of the short run relationship between money, price and output using correlation coefficient. The evidence shows a positive and significant correlation between money and output but negative and insignificant relation between money and price. Secondly, the study examined the nature of the short run causation between output and money using Granger causality test. The result reveals that money cause output and not the other way. Finally, the impact of monetary policy shock on price and output was estimated using structural vector autoregressive model (SVAR), the empirical evidence reveals the existence of puzzling relationship between monetary policy shock and output in Nigeria.

AU  - Ahmadi, Pooyan Amir

AB  - We propose a novel identification strategy of imposing sign restrictions directly on the impulse responses of a large set of variables in a Bayesian factor-augmented vector autoregression. We conceptualize and formalize conditions under which every additional sign restriction imposed can be qualified as either relevant or irrelevant for structural identification up to a limiting case of point identification. Deriving exact conditions we establish that, (i) in a two dimensional factor model only two out of potentially infinite sign restrictions are relevant and (ii) in contrast, in cases of higher dimension every additional sign restriction can be relevant improving structural identification. The latter result can render our approach a blessing in high dimensions. In an empirical application for the US economy we identify monetary policy shocks imposing conventional wisdom and find modest real effects avoiding various unreasonable responses specifically present and pronounced combining standard recursive identification with FAVARs.

AB  - EXTENDED ABSTRACTINTRODUCTIONThe commodity terms of trade shocks are important to explain the macroeconomic fluctuations of oil-exporting countries. Oil price shocks are the main source of terms of trade variability in oil-exporting countries. Given the significant effects of terms of trade fluctuations on domestic macroeconomic variables, understanding the transmission and propagation of terms of trade fluctuations is crucial in the design and conduct of macroeconomic policies in oil-exporting countries. An appropriate monetary policy can help to stabilize these shocks.This study evaluates three alternative monetary policy regimes’ responses to commodity terms of trade shock and export sector productivity shock using a New Keynesian Dynamic Stochastic General Equilibrium (DSGE) model. In this study, the model has been developed based on Hove et al. (2015), Monacelli (2005) and Cashin et al. (2004) for the economy of Iran. This theoretical framework characterizes a small open oil-exporting economy by two domestic sectors: traded sector and the non-traded sector. In the non-traded sector, prices are sticky according to Calvo`s (1983). There is one external sector which is the rest of the world. Also, incomplete exchange rate pass-through is introduced via nominal rigidities on import prices. This model has been developed to evaluate the response of different monetary policy regimes to commodity terms of trade shocks and export productivity shocks. Based on empirical evidence such as Shajari et al (2015), pass-through is assumed to be incomplete in the model.Since oil exports account for a high percentage of export earnings and finance a significant portion of government spending in Iran, the analysis of different monetary policy responses to commodity terms of trade shocks in an oil-exporting country, like Iran, must be important. This study aims at investigating the dynamic effects of commodity terms of trade shocks and evaluating the performance and the stabilization properties of various simple monetary policy rules for oil-dependent economies. Three alternative monetary policy rules have been considered: CPI inflation targeting (CIT) rule, non-traded inflation targeting (NTIT) rule, and exchange rate targeting (ET) rule. Different monetary policy rules are assessed based on the degree to which they minimize the volatility of selected macroeconomic variables as reflected by their impulse response functions. METHODOLOGYThe model is calibrated to match the key features of the Iran economy using data for the period 1991: Q1 to 2017: Q1. The series of Oil production and Non-oil production is obtained from the “Statistical Centre of Iran” The series of Interest rate and oil prices are obtained from the “Central Bank of Iran”. The series of production in the oreign intermediate sector and foreign intermediate good price are obtained from the “Archival Federal Reserve Economic Data”[1]. Other parameters were obtained from previous studies on the Iran economy and business cycle literature in the world. The model is calibrated to the Iran economy. The model is solved numerically and the parameter choices for the model are summarized in Table1. FINDINGSThe comparison of responses under different monetary policy regimes shows that CPI inflation targeting is superior to the NTIT and ET targeting when commodity terms of trade shock happen. For export productivity shock, the performance of the CIT rule is better than other examining monetary policy rules. Also, the real exchange rate, which is defined as a function of commodity terms of trade and productivity differentials, makes it possible to examine the role of export productivity shock on macroeconomic variations and test the existence of Balassa- Samuelson effect. Impulse responses to commodity terms of trade shock show increasing in total output and CPI inflation and decreasing in consumption and nominal exchange rate under three policy rules. The analysis also displays that commodity terms of trade shock induce lower responses of macroeconomic variables under CPI inflation targeting than under non-traded inflation targeting and exchange rate targeting. Under the export sector productivity shock, exported output increases while non-traded output decreases, possibly reflecting the symptoms of the Dutch disease. On the other hand, the dynamic responses of selected macroeconomic variables suggest the presence of the Balassa-Samuelson effect where an increase in productivity in the traded sector appreciates the real exchange rate and increases the prices of non-tradable goods through wage equalizations. CONCLUSIONoverall, when the economy is experiencing commodity terms of trade shocks or exported productivity shocks, CPI inflation targeting is relatively better than exchange rate targeting and non-traded inflation targeting in macroeconomic stabilization.

TI  - How do monetary policy announcements affect inflation expectations?
AU  - Olsson, Kerstin
AB  - This paper examines the effects of policy rate announcements on households' inflation expectations over the time period 2003-2015. The effect is estimated using a two-stage least squares regression model. The announced changes are instrumented by a monetary policy surprise variable obtained from high-frequency swap trade data. The effect of an announced increase in the policy rate on inflation expectations is significant and positive. According to the New-Keynesian model, the effect of an exogenous monetary policy shock depends on the assumptions made on the persistence of the shock process in the model. Alternatively, the results may be interpreted as the policy announcement signalling the central bank's private information on the direction of future inflation. Given the sizeable weight of housing costs in the Swedish CPI basket, the results may also be interpreted as reflecting the direct effect of interest rates on the CPI. In this case, households internalize the effects of interest rates on CPI, when forming expectations about the future rate of inflation.

AB  - From the perspective of principal-agent, the theory of financial acceleration holds that due to the defects of the financial market, external shocks will be amplified by the financial market and accelerate the transmission in the real economy, and the impact on small enterprises is greater than that on large enterprises. According to the theory of financial deceleration, the agency cost caused by financial friction is counter-cyclical, which restrains credit scale to some extent, prevents excessive debt, and thus alleviates external shocks. According to the empirical analysis of panel data of iron and steel enterprises and the existing empirical results of the real estate industry, it is found that there is no financial accelerator effect or financial reducer effect in the field of iron and steel enterprises. China’s financial accelerator is more focused on bubbly assets where growth is expected and continues to be overheated despite policy tightening. That would trigger a bigger debt crisis and greater economic volatility.

TI  - Comparative effects of monetary policy instruments on macroeconomics performance in Nigeria
AU  - Sule, Magaji
AU  - Michael, Jimaza
AU  - A, Ayo
AB  - An appropriate measurement of the effects of monetary policy on macroeconomics policy
targets is essential for effective policy- making and for choosing among alternative
macroeconomic frameworks. The responses of macroeconomic policy targets to the trio of
Monetary policy rate, Cash reserve ratio and Exchange rate and their comparative impacts in
achievement of monetary policy goals cannot be over emphasized. The paper attempts to
determine the most suitable of the monetary policy instruments for the Nigerian economy, so
as to aid the CBN in making a decisive policy. Hence, the broad objective of this study is to
empirically determine the effects of monetary policy instruments on economic growth in
Nigeria. In order to obtain estimates and results that are consistent and not methodology biased,
two econometric estimation techniques were used. And these are Autoregressive Distributed
Lag Model (ARDL) and Vector Error correction model (VECM) after necessary test on
reliability of data are conducted. The choice of the ARDL is based on several considerations.
Also, due to the change in government policy i.e 2006 bank consolidation, test for structural
stability was carried out using CUSUM, CUSUMSQ and Chow test. Standardized regression
was used to find out the comparative or relative effects of the monetary policy instruments
(Monetary policy rate, Cash reserve ratio, and Exchange rate) on the target variable (Economic
growth,).T-statistics and F-statistic were used to carry out statistical significance at 95%
confidence level. Coefficient of multiple determinations (R2) was also used to judge the
strength of the estimated regression equation. Also, Durbin Watson statistic was used to test for
the presence of serial correlation (Autocorrelation), which is also common in time series
data. From the analysis of the model for both alternative sub periods, the coefficients of the
estimated regression (for both ARDL and VECM) are not the same in the two sub periods.
There are significant changes in the coefficients of the policy variables. This means that the
2006 structural reform in the financial sector in Nigeria brought changes in monetary policy
rate, CRR , exchange rate and also changes in economic growth. Also, from the two sub periods
CRR does not have any significant effects on economic growth in short run, but it has effects
in the long run. In the short run, in both sub periods, monetary policy rate does not have
significant effect on economic growth. Also in the long run, it does not have significant effects
on economic growth in both sub periods. In the short run and long run, for both sub periods,
exchange rate has a consistent negative and significant effect on economic growth in Nigeria.

T2  - 2019 3rd International Conference on Data Science and Business Analytics (ICDSBA)
AB  - With market development, China's long-term choice of M2 data as an intermediate target of monetary policy is gradually showing its shortcomings. To find an intermediate target more suitable for China's financial market, scholars are turning their attention towards social financing data. On this basis, this study establishes vector autoregressive (VAR) models with M2, social financing, and RMB loans as quantitative indicators, the Shanghai Interbank Offered Rate (SHIBOR) as a price-based indicator, and CPI and industrial value added as ultimate targets, during the period 2003-2018. This study also combines the VAR models with the impulse response functions and variance decomposition analyses. The empirical results show that social financing can serve as an intermediate target, while we cannot conclude that it is the best intermediate target of monetary policy. At the present, China should focus on both quantitative and price-based indicators, and gradually shift from the former to the latter.

AB  - We assess the effect of tighter monetary policy in the U.S. and emerging market economies (EMEs) on EMEs using a panel factor-augmented VAR model. We find that a U.S. policy rate hike outstrips an equivalent domestic rate hike in its impacts on EMEs. In addition, EMEs show divergent policy responses and their macro-financial responses differ depending upon their economic fundamentals in the face of tighter U.S. policy. In particular, we find that high-inflation than low-inflation EMEs are more susceptible to the shock stemming from a U.S. federal funds rate hike.

TI  - Monetary Policy Analysis in a Small Open Economy Using Bayesian Cointegrated Structural Vars
AU  - Villani, Mattias
AU  - Warne, Anders
AB  - Structural VARs have been extensively used in empirical macroeconomics during the last two decades, particularly in analyses of monetary policy. Existing Bayesian procedures for structural VARs are at best confined to a severly limited handling of cointegration restrictions. This paper extends the Bayesian analysis of structural VARs to cover cointegrated processes with an arbitrary number of cointegrating relations and general linear restrictions on the cointegration space. A reference prior distribution with an optional small open economy effect is proposed and a Gibbs sampler is derived for a straightforward evalution of the posterior distribution. The methods are used to analyse the effects of monetary policy in Sweden.

TI  - Optimal monetary policy, exchange rate misalignments and incomplete financial markets
AU  - Senay, Ozge

T2  - Journal of International Economics
AB  - Recent literature shows that, when international financial trade is restricted to autarky or a single bond, there are internal and external welfare trade-offs that imply optimal monetary policy, in principle, deviates from inflation targeting in order to offset real exchange rate misalignments. This paper develops a more realistic model of incomplete markets, where there is international trade in multiple assets. The analysis shows that the presence of multiple assets creates a potentially powerful interaction between monetary policy and household portfolio allocation. This interaction is, by definition, not present when there is financial autarky or a single tradeable bond and this paper shows that the interaction with portfolio allocation can imply that optimal monetary policy generates a quantitatively much more significant stabilisation of the real exchange rate gap than implied by simpler models of financial market incompleteness.

TI  - Does Monetary Policy Have Asymmetric Effects on Stock Returns?
AU  - Chen, Shiu-Sheng
T2  - Journal of Money, Credit and Banking
AB  - This paper investigates whether monetary policy has asymmetric effects on stock returns using Markov-switching models. Different measures of a monetary policy stance are adopted. Empirical evidence from monthly returns on the Standard & Poor's 500 price index suggests that monetary policy has larger effects on stock returns in bear markets. Furthermore, it is shown that a contractionary monetary policy leads to a higher probability of switching to the bear-market regime.

T2  - Economic Policy
AB  - Following the financial crisis, many have argued that monetary policy should lean against asset price increases and that deviations of credit and asset prices from trend can be used to capture financial imbalances. We study quarterly data spanning 1986–2008 for a sample of 18 countries and argue that such measures contain little information useful for forecasting the future economic conditions. This casts doubts on the leaning-against-the-wind view. We also argue that tightening monetary policy in response to such imbalances are likely to depress real growth substantially. That finding, however, is sensitive to the Lucas critique.— Katrin Assenmacher-Wesche and Stefan Gerlach

TI  - The Spillover Effects of U.S. Monetary Policy on the Chinese Stock Market
AU  - Wei, Wei
AB  - I study a vector autoregression model to estimate the effects of U.S. Quantitative Easing Monetary Policy on the Chinese stock market. I find that the increase of U.S. money supply would result in a significant increase in the Chinese stock market return but the influence is insignificant in the long run. Then I examine three potential mechanisms through which U.S. monetary policy transmits to China: short-term capital flow, monetary policy dependence and stock co-movement. Finally, using the variance decomposition method, I find that the monetary policy dependence mechanism turns to be the most important one among all the three mechanisms and the short-term capital flow mechanism plays the least important role.

T2  - Journal of the Asia Pacific Economy
AB  - This paper examines the effects of monetary policy on investment spending in Malaysia for 1990–2008 using firm-level data. The focal point of this paper is two main channels of monetary policy transmission mechanism, namely, the interest rate and broad credit channels. Using a dynamic neoclassical investment function, empirical results based on system generalised method of moments (GMM) estimations and a sample of 419 firms support the relevance of both interest rate and broad credit channels in influencing investment spending. The results also reveal that the effect of monetary policy channels on firm investment is heterogeneous, such that small firms (i.e. credit-constrained firms) are more responsive to monetary tightening when compared to large firms (i.e. less constrained firms).

TI  - Monetary Policy and the Real Economy: A Structural VAR Approach for Sri Lanka
AU  - Vinayagathasan, Thanabalasingam
T2  - Asian Journal of Empirical Research
AB  - This paper attempts to identify the monetary policy indicator that better explains the Sri Lankan monetary policy transmission mechanism. This study also estimates how shocks stemming from foreign monetary policy and/or oil price affect domestic macroeconomic variables. To that end; we use a seven variable structural VAR model by utilizing monthly time series data from Sri Lanka covering the period from January 1978 to December 2011. Impulse response functions and variance decompositions are used to describe the relationships among variables. Our empirical findings suggest that the interest rate shocks play a significant and better role in explaining the movement of economic variables than monetary aggregate shocks or exchange rate shocks. Second, the targeting of reserve money is a more strategy for the Sri Lankan economy than a focus on narrow or broad money. Third, our findings clearly show that foreign monetary policy shocks and oil price shocks do not seem to affect the domestic economy. Finally, the inclusion of oil price in the SVAR model helped us overcome the puzzles that often appear in the existing literature in monetary economics.

TI  - Targeting Country: The Case of Ghana
AU  - Harvey, Simon K
AB  - Energy inflation has become more volatile and has evolved independently of other
components of headline inflation over the years. Therefore, the use of one Phillips
curve to capture short-run inflation dynamics may be inadequate in terms of helping
the monetary policy authorities to determine the appropriate path of the monetary
policy rate. In particular, such an approach may introduce noise into the model system,
making it difficult to get reliable forecasts for inflation. We extend the existing NewKeynesian model to include separate Phillips curves for energy inflation and nonenergy inflation. This approach would help the monetary policy authority in Ghana to
gain a deeper understanding of how shocks to energy prices affect inflation, thereby
leading to informed decisions about the appropriate path of the monetary policy rate
in Ghana. We also incorporate a fiscal block to capture the effects of fiscal deficits on
inflation in Ghana. We use the extended model to study the transmission mechanisms
of the real economy, and of the exchange rate. This analysis allows us to understand
the importance of these shocks in explaining inflation developments in Ghana and
their implications for monetary policy. The results are mixed, indicating that isolating
energy price from the rest of prices in the CPI basket does not necessarily improve
the forecasts of the key macroeconomic variables, and will therefore not necessarily
lead to better policy outcomes.

Focusing on the housing sector of the Colombian economy, we consider a general equilibrium model with frictions in credit market and bubbles in housing prices. We show that monetary policy is less efficient when it responds directly to asset price of housing than a policy that reacts only to deviations of expected inflation (CPI) from target. Some prudential regulation may provide a better outcome in terms of output and inflation variability.Classification-JEL:E32, E40, E47, E52.

TI  - Essays on monetary policy, disinflation and deflation - ProQuest
AB  - This dissertation analyses U.S. monetary policy over 1979-2004; how monetary
policy can help avoid the liquidity trap; and how economies can escape from the liquidity trap. Chapter 2 proposes a m ethod of estimating the Taylor rule th a t allows
the implicit inflation target and natural rate of interest to vary. I apply this m ethod
to U.S. m onetary policy over 1979-2004. Stability tests indicate significant variation
in the target and the estimated path of the target is corroborated by historical evidence. Chapter 3 investigates how monetary policy can avoid the liquidity trap by
studying the experience of Japan. First, I analyze how the Bank of Japan set interest
rates over the 1990s as the economy entered a deflationary slump. I find th at the
B ank’s implicit inflation target declined to about 1% in the 1990s from about 2.5%
in the 1980s. However, the policy rule respects the Taylor principle and does not
depart from what was perceived as best practice. It thus seems th at the problem
arose because of adverse shocks and not because of an extraordinary m onetary policy
mistake. Next, I investigate whether an alternative policy rule could have avoided
the liquidity trap despite these shocks. Using counter-factual simulations, I find th at
a rule th a t combined both (i) a higher inflation target of about 3%, and (ii) a more
aggressive response to the inflation gap would have avoided the zero bound. Chapter
4 examines the optim al choice of a m onetary policy rule for a small open economy
in a liquidity trap. For a closed economy in a liquidity trap, the optim al policy is
a consumer price index (CPI) targeting rule. However, in an open economy, instead
of targeting the CPI level, the optimal policy involves targeting the domestic price
level. CPI targeting is suboptim al in an open economy because it amplifies inflation
fluctuations. The behaviour of the economy under the optimal price targeting rule

AB  - This paper examines the monetary policy framework of Guyana. Monetary Policy is motivated by the IMF's financial programming model. The quantity of excess reserves in the banking system is seen as critical in determining bank credit and ultimately the external balance and inflationary pressures. Therefore, the central bank is always willing to mop up excess liquidity by selling Treasury bills. The paper examines the potential sources of persistent excess reserves. It then tests using the VAR methodology whether excess reserves exert the postulated effect on the price level and exchange rate. Este documento examina el marco de las pólizas monetarias de Guyana. La Póliza Monetaria está motivada por el modelo de programación financiero del FMI. La cantidad del exceso de las reservas en el sistema bancario, es considerada como crítica en la determinación del crédito bancario, y finalmente el balance externo, así como las presiones inflacionarias. Por esta razón, el banco central está siempre dispuesto a absorber el exceso de liquidez, vendiendo bonos fiscales. El documento examina las fuentes potenciales de reservas excedentes que son persistentes. Luego mide, utilizando el método de VAR, si el exceso de reservas ejerce el efecto postulado en el nivel de los precios y la tasa de cambio.

La quantité de réserves exédentaires dans le système bancaire est considéré comme étant important pour déterminer le crédit bancaire et, de ce fait, la balance externe et les pressions inflationistes. La banque centrale est donc toujours prête à absorber la liquidité exédentaire par la vente de billets de Trésorerie. L'article examine les sources potentielles de réserves exédentaires persistentes. Des tests sont menés ensuite, à l'aide de la méthode VAR, pour determiner si les réserves exédentaires ont l'effet desiré sur le niveau des prix et du change.

AU  - Bauer, Michael D.
AU  - Swanson, Eric T.
AB  - High-frequency changes in interest rates around FOMC announcements are an important tool for identifying the effects of monetary policy on asset prices and the macroeconomy. However, some recent studies have questioned both the exogeneity and the relevance of these monetary policy surprises as instruments, especially for estimating the macroeconomic effects of monetary policy shocks. For example, monetary policy surprises are correlated with macroeconomic and financial data that is publicly available prior to the FOMC announcement. We address these concerns in two ways: First, we expand the set of monetary policy announcements to include speeches by the Fed Chair, which doubles the number and importance of announcements; Second, we explain the predictability of the monetary policy surprises in terms of the “Fed response to news” channel of Bauer and Swanson (2021) and account for it by orthogonalizing the surprises with respect to macroeconomic and financial data that pre-date the announcement. Our subsequent reassessment of the effects of monetary policy yields two key results: First, estimates of the high-frequency effects on asset prices are largely unchanged; Second, estimates of the effects on the macroeconomy are substantially larger and more significant than what previous studies using high-frequency data have typically found.

AB  - The central bank of a commodity-exporting small open economy faces the traditional trade-off between domestic inflation and output gap. The commodity sector introduces a terms-of-trade inefficiency that gives rise to an endogenous cost-push shock, changes the target level for output, reduces the slope of the Phillips curve, and increases the importance of stabilizing the output gap. Optimal monetary policy calls for a reduction of the interest rate following a drop in the oil price. In contrast, a central bank with a mandate to stabilize consumer price inflation raises interest rates to limit the inflationary impact of an exchange rate depreciation.

AB  - Over the past three decades, most African countries have embraced financial liberalisation and relatively independent central banks’ policy framework to facilitate monetary policy transmission into price, interest rates and exchange rates stability. This study tests whether, in an expansionary monetary policy environment, banks with market power can reduce the impact of monetary policy transmission into lower interest rates, price stability and exchange rate stability, especially for emerging countries with opaque financial systems. Additionally, this paper suggests that because banks ration credit in opaque credit markets, the emergence of credit information sharing can mitigate banks’ credit risk when distributing credit, as they will no longer allocate credit solely through interest rates. However, the effect of bank market power on monetary policy transmission in the aftermath of private information sharing coverage varies across the African Union’s various economic communities. The analyses also considered Africa’s economic communities in investigating the nexus between market power and monetary policy transmission to assess the regional effects of the information sharing institutional arrangements. Regional economic communities can induce greater market power because of possible expansion of market share. The results of persistent first difference dynamic GMM show that banks with market power can augment the effort of central banks, which use monetary policy to induce price stability and real interest rates stability. The evidence also shows that the emergence of credit information sharing institutions complements the effect of banks with market power to channel monetary policy transmission into price stability and interest rates stability. Finally, the results indicate that the conduct of banks with market power has different impacts across the subregions. Thus, an aggregate approach in achieving monetary policy targets is not applicable.

T2  - International Journal of Business and Management
AB  - The boom of housing market in China in recent years has attracted great concerns from all over the world. How monetary policy affects house prices in China becomes an essential topic. This paper studies the time-varying effects of monetary policy on house prices in China during 2005.7-2017.10, by using a time-varying parameter VAR model. This paper obtains three interesting results. First, there are time-varying features of the responses of house prices to monetary policy shocks half-year and 1-year ahead, no matter through interest rate channel or through credit channel. Second, interest rate channel and credit channel have been enhanced since financial crisis in 2008. Third, the responses of nominal house prices to monetary policy in China are mainly driven by the responses of real house prices, instead of inflation. Finally, this paper gives proper suggestions for each finding respectively to central bank in China.

TI  - MONETARY POLICY, INFLATION, UNEMPLOYMENT AND THE PHILLIPS CURVE IN SOUTH AFRICA
AU  - Chicheke, Aaron
AB  - Inflation and unemployment are perhaps the two most important challenges that face the South African economy of today. Firstly, the study examines the relationship between monetary policy and the two economic fundamentals (inflation and unemployment), using the VEC modeling technique. The model regresses the monetary policy variable against inflation and unemployment growth over the period 1980-2008. The results suggest that (1) there is a long run relationship between inflation and unemployment (2) monetary policy reacts more to variations in inflation compared to variations in unemployment. Secondly, the relationship between inflation and unemployment as explained by the Phillips curve is investigated. The results show that there is a positive relationship between inflation and unemployment.

TI  - Inﬂation Dynamics And Its Eﬀects On Monetary Policy Rules
AU  - Moleka, Elvis Musango
AB  - This thesis examines dynamic relationships between inflation and monetary policy in a sample of African economies using quarterly data over the period 1980:01
to 2012:04. The literature on inflation dynamics and monetary policy focuses
on developed economies, with little attention devoted to the African economies,
which is potentially explained by the fact that in the past monetary policy played
second fiddle because of fiscal policy dominance following episodes of high inflation and stabilisation policies that occurred in the 1980’s. This thesis fills an
important gap in assessing African’s monetary policy.
The thesis predominantly uses the Vector-Autoregression (VAR) framework
to examine the monetary policy frameworks of the African economies. The thesis
finds that an interest rate shock on average explain a more significant proportion
of the variance in the output gap and inflation than the exchange rate, in terms
of analysing the decomposition of shocks to the economy. This shows a shift in
the monetary policy focus away from exchange rate management to interest rate
targeting as the African economies have become more market oriented. The monetary policy reveal strong asymmetric responses with respect to the macroeconomic variables when inflation exceeds its threshold value. The analysis suggests
that monetary policy in the African economies is regime-dependent, propagated
through the inflation thresholds, such that the authorities strongly implement
policy changes when inflation goes beyond a certain threshold. The thesis reveals
that by taking into account the prior belief of the monetary authorities, it helps
produce better estimates of the performance of the monetary policy transmission mechanism, as it combines prior information with the sampling information
which is contained in the data. The overall novelty of the thesis is that some
African economies are adopting inflation targeting policies instead of exchange
rate management. It is imperative that the subsequent inflation targeting frameworks will achieve monetary policy objectives for the African economies and the
use of interest rate management should be continued.

TI  - Potency of Monetary Policy Instruments on Economic Growth of Nigeria
AU  - Apinran, Martins Olugbenga
AB  - The incapability of the monetary policies to efficiently and effectively exploit its policy objective could be a function of pitfall of policy instruments adopted which restricts its contributions to economic progress in Nigeria. It is on this premise we explore the potency of monetary policy instruments on economic growth in Nigeria between year 2000 and 2015 with time series data. The study engages Johansen multivariate cointegration approach and Vector Error Correction Model (VECM) after all the variables were confirmed stationary at first difference and integrated at similar order I(1) using ADF, PP test and confirmatory technique of KPSS test .The Cointegration measure establishes existence of long-term relationship between monetary policy instruments and economic growth. Also reveal was a low monthly speed of adjustment of the variables towards their long-run equilibrium path to the tune of 26% approximately .The major discovery of this work discloses that Consumer Price Index (CPI) , Real Exchange Rate, Money Supply (M2) and Interest Rate are significant monetary policy instruments that propel economic growth in Nigeria in the year under review. Based on the outcomes, we therefore recommend inflation targeting which will not only assist in proper monitoring of money supply but will also boost the overall growth in the economy. Also Domestic production of exports commodities should be promoted via deliberate policy measure by the Nigerian government so as to ensure stability in real exchange rate and positively contribute to the Nigerian economic growth.

TI  - Does Monetary Policy generate Asset Price Bubbles?
AU  - Hubert, Paul
AU  - Labondance, Fabien
AB  - This paper empirically assesses the effect of monetary policy on asset price bubbles and aims to disentangle the competing predictions of theoretical bubble models. First, we take advantage of the model averaging feature of Principal Component Analysis to estimate bubble indicators, for the stock, bond and housing markets in the United States and Euro area, based on the structural, econometric and statistical approaches proposed in the literature to measure bubbles. Second, we assess the linear and non-linear effect of monetary shocks on these bubble components using local projections. The main result of this paper is that monetary policy does not affect asset price bubble components, except for the US stock market for which we find evidence in favor of the prediction of rational bubble models.

AB  - The effects of monetary policy on the economy show different with respect to its direction, power and the different economic cycle. That is to say, there exists asymmetry in the role of monetary policy. It’s important to research this asymmetry for monetary policy making and keeping economy’s steady growth In this paper, we aim to study the asymmetry in the role of monetary policy with respect to the different economic cycle. First, monetary shock is estimated by using monetary gap and output gap is calculated via HP filter method. Second, based on the monetary gap and output gap, the asymmetric impacts of monetary gap are measured by STR model. The results show that the impacts of monetary shock on economy are asymmetrical significantly. The impact of monetary policy on economy in upturn stage is larger than its impact in downturn stage.

AB  - This paper proposes a method for identifying quantitative and qualitative monetary policy shocks in the balance sheet operations of a central bank. The method is agnostic and flexible as it relies on no assumptions on how the size and composition of the central bank’s balance sheet will respond after the bank makes a policy decision. We identify two types of policy shocks as “anticipated” shocks that best portend the current and future paths of these policy instruments in response to them. We obtain evidence that qualitative easing shocks have expansionary effects on the economy while quantitative easing shocks do not.

AB  - This study investigates the effect of monetary policy shocks in New Zealand and Australia on their respective exchange rates from 1985 to 1998 using vector autoregression methodology. The results show that monetary policy shocks do contribute to the variability of both exchange rates, but these movements are not always consistent with theory. In particular, there is little support for the overshooting hypothesis. Also the results show that the exchange rates do not always move in the direction normally anticipated, particularly for New Zealand. A contraction in monetary policy may lead to a depreciation of the domestic currency rather than an appreciation.

AB  - This study investigates the information content of RBI’s monetary policy and macroeconomic announcements and its impact on the implied volatility index. The empirical findings suggest that implied volatility (VIX) increases prior to the scheduled macroeconomic announcements. This study takes into account the RBI’s (Reserve Bank of India) monetary policy in the form of monetary credit information review meeting days, consumer price index, wholesale/producers price index, index of industrial production, employment report, gross domestic product. The empirical result explains that investors regard the scheduled macroeconomic announcements in the valuation of their financial assets. More specifically study shows that investors jointly consider the MCIR and GDP reports for their financial planning. This study contributes in two ways; it is useful in the forecasting of short-term market volatility and pricing of Options.

Those operational targets effect rupiah stability troughs its effect on economic capacity/GDP.  Using 108 monthly data, that is analyzed by path analysis; this study discusses the effect of net foreign assets (NFA) and net domestic assets (NDA,) and interest rates on the prices (CPI) through their effects GDP. The results show that NFA and NDA have a significant positive effect on GDP, while interest rates are tended to be negative. However, neither the NFA nor the NDA has been proven to have a direct significant effect on CPI. The interest rate has been proven to have a direct significant effect on CPI. GDP was not proven to have a significant effect on the CPI and neither mediates the effects of operational targets on CPI.Keywords: Rupiah; Prices; CPI; Stability; Money

AB  - Korean Abstract: 본 논문은 주요 19개국을 대상으로 통화정책 충격이 생산과 물가에 미치는 효과에 차이가 있는지, 있다면 그러한 차이가 어떤 요인에 의해 유발되는지를 부호제약 구조VAR 모형과 2단계 회귀분석, 그리고 소규모 개방경제 DSGE 모형을 통해 살펴보았다. 구조VAR 분석 결과 동일한 크기의 통화정책 충격이 생산 및 물가에 미치는 효과에는 국가마다 차이가 있었다. 생산에 미치는 효과를 보면 다수 국가에서 25bp 금리 인하 충격 발생 시 산업생산이 최대 1~2% 증가하는 가운데 3% 넘게 증가하는 국가부터 유의하게 감소하는 국가까지 다양하게 분포하였다. 물가 역시 최대 반응 기준 평균적인 상승폭은 0.9% 수준이었으나 2.0% 가까이 상승한 국가부터 상승폭이 0.3%에 그친 국가까지 폭넓게 존재했다. 일부 국가는 시간이 지남에 따라 물가가 하락하는 반응까지 보였다. 회귀분석 결과 이와 같은 통화정책 충격에 대한 반응의 차이는 다양한 요인들에 의해 영향을 받는 것으로 나타났다. 생산의 경우 통화정책 체계가 물가안정목표제에 가까울수록, 환율제도가 변동환율제에 가까울수록, 인구고령화 진행이 빠를수록, 노동시장 경직도가 높을수록 반응이 확대되었고 중앙은행이 독립적일수록, 자본시장 발전도가 높을수록 동 반응이 축소되었다. 물가의 경우 통화정책 체계가 물가안정목표제에 가까울수록, 인구고령화가 진행될수록 반응이 축소되었고 무역의존도와 노동시장 경직성이 높을수록 확대되었다. 아울러 간단한 소규모 개방경제 DSGE 모형을 이용하여 통화정책 운영체계, 무역개방도, 노동시장 경직성이 통화정책 효과에 미치는 영향을 점검한 결과 실증분석이 시사하는 바와 대체로 일치하는 것으로 나타났다.English Abstract: This paper investigates with a sample of 19 countries whether there exist differences in the effects of monetary shocks on outputs and prices between countries, and, if any, which country characteristics incur such differences using sign-restricted VAR, second-stage regression, and small open economy DSGE model. Sign-restricted VAR analysis shows that monetary policy shocks with the same magnitude generate differences between countries in terms of the effects on outputs and prices. The maximal responses of industrial production indexes to a 25-basis-point shock policy rate cut range from a significant decrease to an over 3 percent increase with an average of about 1 to 2 percent increase. Those of consumer price indexes range from a 0.3 percent increase to around a 2 percent increase with an average of a 0.9 percent increase, but some countries exhibit price puzzles in the long-run horizons. The results from regression analysis imply that various country characteristics engender disparities in the responses to monetary policy shocks. The size of the output responses to monetary policy shocks is larger in countries with a monetary policy framework closer to inflation-targeting, a more flexible exchange rate regime, more rapid population aging, and a more rigid labor market, and is smaller in countries with a more independent central bank and a more developed capital market. The size of the price responses is larger in countries with higher trade openness and a more rigid labor market, and smaller in countries with a monetary policy framework closer to inflation-targeting and more rapid population aging. Furthermore, the results from the small open economy DSGE model which we use to check whether a monetary policy framework, trade openness and labor market rigidity can make a difference in the effects of monetary policy shocks largely correspond to those of the regression analysis.
