TI  - Has the Monetary Transmission Process in the Euro Area Changed? Evidence Based on VAR Estimates
AU  - Weber, Axel A.
AU  - Gerke, Rafael
AU  - Worms, Andreas
AB  - Empirical evidence on whether the euro area monetary transmission process has changed is, at best, mixed. We argue that this inconclusiveness is likely to be due to the fact that existing empirical studies concentrate on the effects of a particular development on a specific transmission channel. Another problem of this literature is that specific changes could have off-setting effects regarding the overall effectiveness of monetary policy, leaving open the question whether the ability of monetary policy to control inflation has been altered. In order to shed light on this issue, we investigate whether there has been a significant change in the overall transmission of monetary policy to inflation and output by estimating a standard VAR for the euro area and by searching for a possible break date. We find a significant break point around 1996 and some evidence for a second one around 1999. We compare impulse responses to a monetary policy shock for these episodes and find that the well-known 'stylised facts' of monetary policy transmission remain valid. Therefore, we argue that the general guiding principles of the Eurosystem monetary policy remain adequate. Moreover, it seems that monetary transmission after 1998 is not very different from before 1996, but probably very different in the interim period. This implies that evidence for the euro area could be biased by an 'atypical' interim period 1996-1999. This is part of a series of BIS Working Papers (273 to 278) collecting papers presented at the BIS's Seventh Annual Conference on 'Whither monetary policy? Monetary policy challenges in the decade ahead' in Luzern, Switzerland, on 26-27 June 2008. The event brought together senior representatives of central banks and academic institutions to exchange views on this topic. BIS Paper 45 contains the opening address of William R White (BIS), the contributions of the policy panel on 'Beyond price stability - the challenges ahead' and speeches by Edmund Phelps (Columbia University) and Martin Wolf (Financial Times). The participants in the policy panel discussion chaired by Malcolm D Knight (BIS) were Martin Feldstein (Harvard University), Stanley Fischer (Bank of Israel), Mark Carney (Bank of Canada) and Jean-Pierre Landau (Banque de France). This Working Paper includes comments by Marvin Goodfriend and Armínio Fraga Neto.

TI  - GDP deflator vis-À-vis other price indices in India: An exploratory study
AB  - Inflation, a rise in the general level of prices, is not an easy thing to measure. Many price statistics are available to keep tabs on average prices. Index like the Wholesale Price Index track the prices of commodities sold in wholesale markets. Others, like the Consumer Price Indices track the prices an average consumer pay for the goods or services they acquire. There are broader indexes, like the GDP deflator, which is based on gross domestic product. While each of the measures has its advantages as well as weaknesses, the selected measure of inflation should broadly capture the interplay of effective demand and supply forces in the economy. However, recent period has witnessed a growing evidence of some divergence in the annual movement of the usual price indices and GDP deflator over the longer term. This paper addresses this issue of why and how movements of GDP deflator diverge from other price indices in India. Besides conceptual differences, GDP deflator and price indices differ on account of the distinct sectoral methodologies followed for converting GDP at current prices to GDP at constant prices. In particular, GDP deflator does not have a long-run equilibrium relationship with WPI. Therefore, utility of WPI as a measure of inflation in India seems to be limited.

TI  - Monetary Policy Credibility and the Comovement between Stock Returns and Inflation
AU  - Araújo, Eurilton
AB  - Empirical evidence suggests that the magnitude of the negative comovement between real stock returns and inflation declined during the Great Moderation in the U.S. To understand the role of monetary policy credibility in this change, I study optimal monetary policy under loose commitment in a macroeconomic model in which stock price movements have direct implications for business cycles. In line with the data, a calibration of the model featuring a significant degree of credibility can replicate the weakening of the negative relationship between real stock returns and inflation in the Great Moderation era.

AU  - Cassou, Steven P.

AU  - Vázquez, Jesús
T2  - Applied Economics
AB  - The primary goal of this article is to investigate whether properly modelling real-time data and optimal real-time decision-making of a monetary planner provides new insights into monetary policy behaviour and outcomes. This article extends a variant of the asymmetric preference model suggested by Ruge-Murcia to investigate the use of real-time data available to policymakers when making their decisions and revised data which more accurately measure economic performance, but is only available much later. In our extended model, the central banker targets a weighted average of revised and real-time inflation together with a weighted average of revised and real-time output. Moreover, we allow for an asymmetric central bank response to real-time data depending on whether the unemployment rate is high or low. Our model identifies several new potential sources of inflation bias due to data revisions. Our empirical results suggest that the Federal Reserve Bank focuses on targeting revised inflation during low unemployment periods, but it weighs heavily real-time inflation during high unemployment periods. The inflation bias due to data revisions is comparable in magnitude to the bias from asymmetric central banker preferences with the bias being somewhat larger during high unemployment.

AU  - Aldasoro, Iñaki

AB  - Using a Bayesian vector autoregression (BVAR) identified with a mix of sign and zero restrictions, we show that a restrictive bank loan supply shock has a strong and persistent negative impact on real GDP and the GDP deflator. This result comes about even though flows of other sources of financing, such as equity and debt securities, expand strongly and act as a "spare tire" for the reduction in bank loans. We show that this result can be rationalized by a recently revived view of banking, which holds that banks increase the nominal purchasing power of the economy when they create additional deposits in the act of lending. Consequently, our findings indicate that a substitution of bank loans by other sources of financing might have negative macroeconomic repercussions.

T2  - Applied Economics
AB  - Inflation forecasts are a key ingredient for monetary policy-making – especially in an inflation targeting country such as South Africa. Generally, a typical Dynamic Stochastic General Equilibrium (DSGE) only includes a core set of variables. As such, other variables, for example alternative measures of inflation that might be of interest to policy-makers, do not feature in the model. Given this, we implement a closed-economy New Keynesian DSGE model-based procedure which includes variables that do not explicitly appear in the model. We estimate such a model using an in-sample covering 1971Q2 to 1999Q4 and generate recursive forecasts over 2000Q1 to 2011Q4. The hybrid DSGE performs extremely well in forecasting inflation variables (both core and nonmodelled) in comparison with forecasts reported by other models such as AR(1). In addition, based on ex-ante forecasts over the period 2012Q1–2013Q4, we find that the DSGE model performs better than the AR(1) counterpart in forecasting actual GDP deflator inflation.

TI  - Firm Heterogeneity and Monetary Policy Transmission
AU  - Thürwächter, Claire
AB  - This paper studies diﬀerences in monetary policy transmission across ﬁrms. Using high-frequency identiﬁcation, I estimate ﬁrm-level elasticities of investment to an exogenous change in interest rates. Next, a Random Forest algorithm is employed to investigate which ﬁrm characteristics are important for explaining variation in investments. I ﬁnd that age and size of ﬁrms are important observables for transmission heterogeneity and investment responses weaken in both age and size. In contrast, investments of high-growth ﬁrms, for any age and size, are not sensitive to monetary policy. I conclude with a discussion of potential mechanisms for rationalizing this ﬁnding.

T2  - Journal of Economics
AB  - The high inflation is undesirable phenomenon. The causing factors of high inflation remained inconclusive by both monetary and fiscal perceptions. The procurement prices and administered prices along with imported inflation have contributed to higher inflation. The paper focuses on the determinants of inflation in Pakistan using four price indicators, i.e. CPI, WPI, SPI, and GDP Deflator for the long-run (time period of 1971-72 to 2005-06). It is found that depreciation of exchange rate and increase in the value of imports has contributed shooting up of CPI, WPI, SPI and GDP deflator. The support prices of sugarcane, rice, wheat, and cotton (collectively) have affected all the indicators positively however, the support price of wheat independently has affected only GDP deflator. Expectation effect has also contributed positively towards all the indicators. Contrary to the general perception that budget deficit creates inflation, our results explain that budget deficit has played no role in boosting all the four indicators of inflation in Pakistan in the long-run.

T2  - Journal of Banking & Finance
AB  - This paper provides new empirical evidence on a monetary policy committee with heterogeneous members whose decisions affect the efficacy of monetary policy. It thereby provides a link between the literature on monetary policy committees and central bank monetary policy implementation through monetary rules. Using a novel dataset of the idiosyncratic characteristics of FOMC members, over the period from August 1979 to February 2014, the empirical findings show that characteristics such as education, age, and, to a lesser extent, work experience are not important in understanding the FOMC decision-making process. Instead, the results point to the importance of time spent within the Federal Reserve System, tenure on the FOMC itself, and the influence of the Chair in shaping the decision-making process. The results are expected to have implications for the capacity of economic agents, as well as various markets in the economy, to more readily interpret public (monetary policy) information that reaches them. This makes the monetary policy decision process less noisy and thus enhances the capability of agents and markets to attach the correct weight to this information.

Price Level is cause of higher Industrial Sector Output in HDCs (High Income) and LDCs (Low Income Developing Countries) while it is negative factor for MDCs (Middle Income Countries) in the long run. Moreover, energy consumption has been found a cause of Higher Industrial Sector Output (IND) in MDCs (Middle Income Countries) in long run.

AB  - Monetary authorities rarely disclose the true reasons behind their policy reactions. A tracing of the policy reaction function to see if the monetary authority is applying simple rules holds the potential to offer profound insight into the past behavioral relationship between the monetary authority and economic agencies. A reasonable body of knowledge about the direction of monetary policy would, moreover, assist economic agencies in forming their expectations, which would in turn, be useful for the monetary authority in anticipating the likely trends of the overall economy. The main objective of this study is to track de Brouwer and Gilbert (2005) from the Australian financial deregulation era (from 1983 to 2002) to the present. Empirical findings show that the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) is more forward-looking when formulating monetary policy rather than backward-looking, and that inflation targeting plays a significant role in stabilizing the output of the economy.

AB  - The main objective of this paper is to identify a set of leading indicators of inflation for the United Kingdom, and discuss the conceptual issues pertaining to inflation targeting. The main conclusions are that narrow money has strong leading indicator properties for inflation, while broad money does not. Long yields appear to have some information for the GDP deflator, and headline inflation, and short yields for underlying inflation. Spreads between commercial paper and gilts, and the yield curve, have very little predictive information on inflation. An interesting conclusion is that while the nominal effective exchange rate is not a good predictor of inflation, the sterling-deutsche mark exchange rate appears to have weak predictive information on the targeted measure of inflation.

AB  - We assess the pros and cons of nominal GDP targeting vis-à-vis flexible inflation targeting regime. We show that the benefit of a regime shift towards nominal GDP targeting in the euro area might be small. Moreover, nominal GDP targeting is not concerned with financial stability. Finally, targeting nominal GDP would make ECB communication very difficult. If the aim of a regime shift were to bring the ECB to pay more attention to growth, it would be more straightforward to fix a dual mandate and to set an explicit target for real output growth or the unemployment rate.

AB  - Interest in nominal GDP (NGDP) targeting has come in the context of large advanced economies. Developing countries are better suited for it, however, in light of big supply shocks and terms of trade shocks, such as monsoon rains and oil import price shocks in the case of India. Under annual inflation targeting (IT), the full impact of adverse supply shocks is felt as lost real GDP. NGDP targeting automatically accommodates such shocks, while retaining the advantage of anchoring expectations. We derive the condition under which NGDP targeting would dominate other regimes such as annual IT, to achieve objectives of output and price stability. We estimate key parameters for the case of India and conclude that the condition may indeed hold.

AB  - The two major objectives of a central bank are the maintenance of the stability of prices and that of the financial system. To use harsh language, the Bank of Japan (henceforth, the BOJ) has failed to meet each of the two objectives once during the past two and a half decades. In the early 1970s the rate of inflation rose to levels above 20 percent. Since 1992 the economy has been suffering from the most serious instability in the financial system since the 1920s. The purpose of this chapter is to review the BOJ’s conduct of monetary policy over the past two to three decades and discuss the relationship between the two mistakes and the way monetary policy has been carried out.

TI  - Analysing Divisia Aggregates for the Euro Area
AU  - Reimers, Hans-Eggert
AB  - In this paper, different Divisia monetary aggregates for the euro area are constructed over the period from 1980 to 2000. Theoretically, one main difference of these aggregates is their reaction to exchange-rate variations. Empirically, the aggregates are compared with respect to three issues. First, the demand for the Divisia aggregates is evaluated using the cointegrated VEC model and single-equation techniques, where stable demand functions are estimated. Second, the information content of these aggregates as regards future output is investigated. Evidence is presented that one of the Divisia aggregates has most information content from a forward-looking perspective. Third, using the P-star framework, the importance of money for future price movements is examined. Adapting an in-sample analysis, Divisia aggregates are important for HICP development and to some extent for GDP deflator movement. The out-ofsample forecasting exercise presents, on the one hand, evidence that simple-sum M3 includes more information for the HICP, whereas one of the Divisia aggregates helps to predict the future GDP deflator. On the other hand conspicuous control errors exist. In sum, the paper supports the view that money should have an important role in the conduct of monetary policy in the euro area.

In particular, the main conclusions that emerge from the literature review are the following: A permanent 40% reduction in the international price of oil over 3 years horizon is expected to increase on average the real GDP growth from 0.33% to 0.66%. A permanent 40% reduction in the international price of oil over 3 years horizon is expected to decrease on average the inflation from -1.45% to -1.78%.

TI  - Monetary policy rules in theory and in practice: evidence from the UK and the US
AU  - Paez-Farrell, Juan
T2  - Applied Economics
AB  - Given the large amount of interaction between research on monetary policy and its practice, this article examines whether some simple monetary policy rules that have been proposed in the academic literature, part of which has originated from within central banks, provide a reasonable characterization of actual policy in the United Kingdom and the United States. The article finds the simple rule that describes best the actual US monetary policy is a speed limit rule with dynamics, whilst for the UK it is a forward-looking rule. The simpler dynamics in the UK's monetary policy rule are reflective of the lower persistence of inflation as a result of its policy of inflation targeting.

TI  - THE PREDICTIVE POWER OF MONEY FOR INFLATION AND ECONOMIC ACTIVITY: THE MODERATING ROLE OF ASSET PRICES
AU  - Shafiq, Hina
AU  - Malik, Wasim Shahid
T2  - Pakistan Economic and Social Review
AB  - In the past three decades the focus of researchers and policy makers shifted from money to interest rate as monetary policy instrument owing to low predictive and explanatory power of the former for the target variables – real economic activity and the inflation rate. In this study, we hypothesize that the apparent weak relationship between money and the target variables, found in empirical literature, is predominantly due to the absence of asset prices in the empirical models (see for instance, Bernanke and Blinder, 1992). We test our hypothesis using data of the Pakistan economy over the period 1981 Q1 to 2018 Q2. We compare the forecasting power of interest rate with that of money stock for goods prices and real economic activity in the presence of asset prices. This has been done using Granger causality test and by decomposing variances of the GDP deflator rate and output. In both cases, the predictive power of money, for the prices and output, significantly increases when asset prices are considered in the model. Moreover, as a second objective, we also find out the moderating role that asset prices play in strengthening or weakening the relationship between money and the target variables. This has been done using two different methods; the two steps regression based method and by incorporating an interaction term of asset prices and money in the regressions of the target variables. In both cases, we find evidence of asset prices affecting the relationship between money and the target variables. More specifically, the asset prices proved to weaken the relationship between money and price level and strengthen the relationship between money and the economic activity.

AU  - Braunstein, Elissa

T2  - International Review of Applied Economics
AB  - This article considers the employment costs of inflation reduction in developing countries from a gender perspective. We explore two broad empirical questions: (1) what is the impact of inflation reduction on employment, and is the impact different for women and men, and (2) how are monetary policy indicators (e.g. real interest rates) connected to deflationary episodes and gender‐specific employment effects? We find a common pattern among countries undergoing what we term contractionary inflation reduction, or periods of declining inflation that are accompanied by a loss of formal employment. After controlling for long‐term employment trends, we find that the ratio of women’s to men’s employment tends to decline during these periods in the majority of countries examined. During the fewer periods of expansionary inflation reduction, however, there are no clear patterns to the relative changes in women’s and men’s employment. Maintaining competitive exchange rates seems to counterbalance the gender‐biased effects of contractionary inflation reduction episodes, however.

T2  - Economic Modelling
AB  - The paper provides evidence on New Keynesian Phillips Curves (NKPCs) for the euro area and a group of seven new member countries that joined the European Union (EU) in and after 2004 employing two alternative methods of estimation: the generalized method of moments (GMM) and time-varying coefficient (TVC) estimation techniques. The latter technique has the advantage over the former technique in that it can deal with possible specification biases and can detect spurious relationships that may have arisen from the structural changes of the past decades. The NKPCs are used to compare inflation dynamics between the euro area and the group of seven new member countries and are connected with sufficient conditions for monetary policies to be good policies. If the slopes of the short run Phillips curves are similar, in that the frequency of nominal price adjustments are comparable, the implication is that a one-size monetary policy may fit all — that is, both the euro area and the group comprising the new members.

AB  - This paper examines the changes in monetary policy and monetary transmission over time in four developed countries (the United States, the United Kingdom, Canada, and Australia) using time-varying vector autoregression (TVP-VAR) models. The results suggest some comovements in the monetary policy reactions to unemployment across countries before the recent Global Financial Crisis (GFC). The policy rate seems to react more aggressively against unemployment in more recent years. However, the effects of monetary policy shocks on unemployment and inflation appear to have weakened over time.

TI  - Monetary Policy in Retrospective: A Taylor Rule Inspired Exercise
AU  - Jalil, Munir A.
AB  - A time varying backward-looking Taylor rule, that is, a Taylor rule in which the coefficients change over time is estimated over the period 1954-2003 using historically revised data and the years 1965-1998 using real time (unrevised) data. The findings seem to show that during the 1970s a first attempt was made in order to respond to inflation, but later policymakers seemed to stop trying. The change to a higher response to inflation was a gradual one and reached its peak in 1982. After that, the response was consistent and along the lines of the Taylor principle. Also, estimation of an alternative specification in which the chairman and election years' effects are explicitly taken care of provides evidence in favor of time variation in the inflation coefficient regardless of the type of data used. The latter indicates that instability in the monetary policy reaction function is explained by reasons that go beyond the type of data used, who the Chairman of the FOMC is, and election years.

AB  - Iran has more than a century of history in exploration and production; the first successful exploration well was Masjid Suleiman-1 on May 26, 1908. Since then, based on the latest oil and gas reports, 145 hydrocarbon fields and 297 oil and gas reservoirs have been discovered in Iran, with many fields having multiple pay zones. Proved oil reserves in Iran, according to its government, rank fifth largest in the world at approximately 150 billion barrels as of 2014, although it ranks third if Canadian reserves of unconventional oil are excluded. This is roughly 10% of the world's total proven petroleum reserves. Oil sector in most of oil exporting countries (such as Iran) is a state-run sector and oil revenues belong to government. Iran is an energy superpower and the Petroleum industry in Iran plays an important part in it. In 2004 Iran produced 5.1 percent of the world’s total crude oil (3.9 million barrels per day), which generated revenues of US$25 billion to US$30 billion and was the country’s primary source of foreign currency. At 2006 levels of production, oil proceeds represented about 18.7 percent of gross domestic product (GDP). However, the importance of the hydrocarbon sector to Iran’s economy has been far greater. The oil and gas industry has been the engine of economic growth, directly affecting public development projects, the government’s annual budget, and most foreign exchange sources. In 2009, the sector accounted for 60 percent of total government revenues and 80 percent of the total annual value of both exports and foreign currency earnings. Oil and gas revenues are affected by the value of crude oil on the international market. It has been estimated that at the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) quota level (December 2004), a one-dollar change in the price of crude oil on the international market would alter Iran’s oil revenues by US$1 billion. The main hypothesis of this study is that the government's dependence on oil revenues has been caused policy passivity in Iran's economy. Fiscal policy and monetary policy are the two tools used by the state to achieve its macroeconomic objectives. While for many countries the main objective of fiscal policy is to increase the aggregate output of the economy, the main objective of the monetary policies is to control the interest and inflation rates. Traditionally, both the policy instruments were under the control of the national governments. Thus traditional analyses were made with respect to the two policy instruments to obtain the optimum policy mix of the two to achieve macroeconomic goals, lest the two policy tools be aimed at mutually inconsistent targets. In case of an active fiscal policy and a passive monetary policy, when the economy faces an expansionary fiscal shock that raises the price level, money growth passively increases as well because the monetary authority is forced to accommodate these shocks. But in case both the authorities are active, then the expansionary pressures created by the fiscal authority are contained to some extent by the monetary policies. In other word the central bank's monetary policy and fiscal policy of the government have a heavy reliance on oil revenues and budgeting and monetary changes, instead of being active and effective, have an affective and passive nature and are subject to oil shocks. In this study in order to investigate this hypothesis, seasonal data of 1369:1 to 1389:4 of oil revenues, government expenditures (as a representative of fiscal policy), monetary base (as a representative of monetary policy), GDP, exchange rate and GDP deflator (as a representative of price index) in a Factor-Augmented Bayesian Vector Autoregressive model have been used. If a small number of estimated factors effectively summarize large amounts of information about the economy, then a natural solution to the degrees-of-freedom problem in VAR analyses is to augment standard VARs with estimated factors. In this paper we consider the estimation and properties of factor-augmented vector autoregressive models (FAVARs). Results of impulse response function and variance decomposition clearly confirm the passive monetary and fiscal policy in the Iranian economy. In other words, among the variables of model, the most affected variables respectively are the monetary base and government expenditures. According to the authors, there are two basic ways to deal with policy passivity, which are sterilization and stabilization of oil revenues through the correct management of stabilization funds and diversification of exports. Sterilization is, not to bring all the revenues into the country all at once, and to save some of the revenues abroad in special funds and bring them in slowly. In developing countries, this can be politically difficult as there is often pressure to spend the boom revenues immediately to alleviate poverty, but this ignores broader macroeconomic implications. Sterilisation will reduce the spending effect, alleviating some of the effects of inflation. Another benefit of letting the revenues into the country slowly is that it can give a country a stable revenue stream, giving more certainty to revenues from year to year. Also, by saving the boom revenues, a country is saving some of the revenues for future generations. In addition Oil stabilization funds are usually designed to address the problems created by the volatility and unpredictability of oil revenues, the need to save part of the oil revenues for future generations or both.

AU  - Hillinger, Claude

AB  - We introduce an approach for the empirical study of the quantity theory of money (QTM) that is novel both with respect to the specific steps taken as well as the general methodology employed. Empirical studies of the QTM have focused directly on the relationship between the rate of change of the money stock and inflation. We believe that this is an inferior starting point for several reasons and focus instead on the Cambridge form of the QTM. We find that the coefficient k fluctuates strongly in the short run, but has a low and steady rate of change in the long run, which makes the QTM a useful instrument for the long-run control of inflation. An important finding that contradicts all of the previous literature is that the QTM holds for low inflation as well as for high inflation. We discuss how our findings relate to monetarism generally and propose an adaption of McCallum’s rule for a Friedmanian monetary policy.

TI  - A Survey of Taylor-Type Monetary Policy Rules
AU  - Hamalainen, Nell
AB  - There are numerous ways to specify monetary-policy reaction functions in economic
models. In recent years, the practice of using the Taylor rule, or more generally, Taylor-type
rules, as a monetary policy rule has become more wide spread in the economic literature. The
structure of this rule is simple and tractable but at the same time captures the essence of the
behaviour of the monetary authority. In this paper, we present a brief survey of the literature on
the properties of Taylor-type monetary policy rules. We review the modifications made to the
original Taylor rule and their justifications, the empirical and theoretical issues related to the use
and design of the rule, the use of calibrated versus estimated Taylor-type rules in economic
models, and the practices of choosing an optimal monetary policy rule.

T2  - International Journal of Finance & Economics
AB  - This study employs Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) and Autoregressive Conditional Heteroskedasctic (ARCH) models to examine the impact of the unconventional monetary policies implemented in the United States upon the exchange rate movement and volatility in the emerging and growth-leading economies (EAGLEs), which include Brazil, India, Indonesia, Mexico, Philippines and Turkey. Two series of exchange rates, namely average exchange rate (AER) and end-of-period exchange rate (EER), are used with different sets of sample, EER covers 1990:01 to 2018:04 and AER spans over 1980:01 to 2018:04 period. The variance series of the ARCH model is used to measure the volatility of AER and EER. The best ARIMA model is estimated for AER and EER for each country, and the ARIMA model serves as the mean equation for the ARCH volatility measure. Unlike the previous studies, this paper focuses on the EAGLEs, employs exchange rate, and considers various ARCH alternatives in choosing the best model. The findings of the study reveal that India is the only country among the EAGLEs whose exchange rate movement is affected by the U.S. unconventional monetary policy. Another important point is the negative effect of QE policies on the volatility of both AER and EER across the EAGLEs countries. The implication is that QE policies tend to reduce the uncertainty in the foreign exchange of the EAGLEs countries. Hence the policy makers in the EAGLEs countries do not need to take any action whenever the United States pursues unconventional monetary policy.

AB  - Inflation in the USA for the period between 1960 and 2004 is studied in the framework of evident rigidity of personal income distribution normalized to the total nominal GDP. Inflation is found to be a mechanism, which counters changes in the relative incomes induced by economic growth and population changes - both in number and age structure. A model is developed linking the measured inflation (consumer price index or GDP deflator), unemployment and change in labor force. During the last twenty-five years, unemployment in the USA has been a lagged linear function of inflation. In turn, inflation has also been a lagged linear function of relative change in labor force with time. The lag is currently three years.

I use Christiano et al. (CEE, 2005) as an example to examine this argument empirically. According to the findings of this paper, the impulse responses provided by the structural VAR model may be derived from the biased estimates if we allow variables to be correlated with each other through different horizons. It remains possible for a skeptic to maintain some dominant views inferred from the biased coefficients of the SVAR models.

AB  - Rules-based monetary policy evaluation has long been central to macroeconomics. Using the original Taylor rule, a modified Taylor rule with a higher output gap coefficient, and an estimated Taylor rule, we define rules-based and discretionary eras by smaller and larger policy rule deviations, the absolute value of the difference between the actual federal funds rate and the federal funds rate prescribed by the three rules. We use tests for multiple structural changes to identify the eras so that knowledge of subsequent economic outcomes cannot influence the choice of the dates. With the original Taylor rule, monetary policy in the U.S. is characterized by a rules-based era until 1974, a discretionary era from 1974 to 1985, a rules-based era from 1985 to 2000, and a discretionary era from 2001 to 2013. With the modified Taylor rule, the rules-based era extends further into the 1970s and there is an additional rules-based period starting in 2006. We calculate various loss functions and find that economic performance is uniformly better during rules-based eras than during discretionary eras, and that the original Taylor rule provides the largest loss during discretionary periods relative to loss during rules-based periods.

TI  - The relationship between monetary policy and gross domestic product in Kenya
AU  - Mathenge, Eric M.
AB  - This study sought to establish the relationship between Monetary Policy and GDP in
Kenya. GDP no doubt is affected by the Monetary Policy of the state. Among the monetary
policies that the CBK adopts in intervening the Kenyan economy, Open Market Operation
is the one which is most frequently used due to its easily observable effect and relatively
low cost during operation. Via buying and selling treasuries the C.B.K adjusts the money
supply in the market and manipulates the economy. In recent years, a modern practice of
this policy is used by the CBK which targets the money market funds rate to control the
money supply. The research papers of various authors have been studied in this regard to
prove the Hypothesis and after in depth analysis by applying Regression Analysis
technique it has been observed that the relationship between the two exists. The data of
past 10 years of Kenya has been used for driving the conclusion. The study proved that the
Growth in Money Supply greatly affects the GDP of an economy, obviously various
unknown factors also affects the GDP.
This research shows that Monetary Policy has a Positive relationship with GDP although
the relationship is not that significant. This positive relationship can be explained by the
fact that the level of Money Supply in the economy influences the purchasing power of
firms, Individuals and also the Expenditure of the Government. The research further shows
that the Rate of Growth of Labour, EXPO, Government Expenditure and Aggregate
Investment also do not have a significant determinant on the rate of growth of GDP. In
addition, Money Supply the variable of interest was found not to be a significant
determinant of GDP in Kenya this is because there are structural weaknesses in the
financial sector such as weak legal framework, poor governance, and insufficient
infrastructure, which have contributed to high interest rate spreads, inadequate financial
intermediation and heightened risks and therefore hamper the transmission mechanism of
monetary policy. This is also because when the CBK is targeting a certain interest rate
(repo rate) to control the money Supply it is the GDP that influences the level of Money
Supply in circulation and not Money Supply affecting the output.

TI  - Money demand stability: A case study of Nigeria
AU  - Kumar, Saten
AU  - Webber, Don J.
AU  - Fargher, Scott
T2  - Journal of Policy Modeling
AB  - Monetary policy in Nigeria aims is to achieve price and monetary stability. During the 1980s and 1990s, monetary targeting was the dominant monetary policy framework in Nigeria. However, in 2006 the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) adopted the new monetary policy framework through which short-term interest rates are adjusted to achieve stability in the value of the domestic currency. This paper has presented an empirical investigation into the demand for Nigerian real narrow money (M1) over the period 1960–2008 in an attempt to identify whether the CBN were right to adopt the new monetary policy framework. In doing so, we estimate alternative (canonical and extended) specifications of M1 demand using structural change methods. Our results suggest that the canonical specification is well-determined. Although the money demand relationship went through a regime shift in 1986, it is largely stable. These findings favour the use of supply of money as an instrument of monetary policy, thus lending limited support for the new monetary policy framework.

AB  - The European Central Bank (ECB) is currently conducting a review of its monetary policy strategy. The last formal review took place in 2003. Now the focus is on the extent to which this strategy has contributed in recent years to fulfill the mandate set out in the Treaties of the European Union and whether certain elements need to be adjusted. Against this background, the Kronberger Kreis, the academic advisory board of the Stiftung Marktwirtschaft (Market Economy Foundation), examines whether the ECB's monetary policy strategy still holds promise for success, whether its mandate should be reinterpreted and how the use of specific instruments should be assessed. In its analysis, the Kronberger Kreis draws on the experience of the financial crisis, the euro debt crisis and the coronavirus crisis and argues that greater attention should be paid to the side effects and proportionality of monetary policy measures. The central banks of the Eurosystem are now the largest creditors of the member states. Fiscal dominance of monetary policy should be avoided. The ECB's hierarchical mandate prioritizing price stability should not be called into question. The envisaged numerical target for consumer price inflation of below, but close to, two percent remains reasonable. However, the ECB should also consider other measures of inflation in its decisions and their communication. In addition, the ECB should rely more strongly on quantitative benchmarks (interest rate rules, money supply growth). The transparency of monetary policy could be significantly increased, for example, by publishing surveys and forecasts of the ECB's Governing Council. In principle, all measures must take into account the need to strengthen the independence of the ECB and the stability of the monetary union.

AU  - Moons, Cindy

T2  - Journal of Policy Modeling
AB  - This paper provides empirical evidence of the role of the euro in the genesis of the recent Irish financial-economic crisis. By using a Taylor rule we measure the appropriateness of the ECB’s one-size-fits-all policy rate for the Irish economy. A counterfactual analysis suggests that the Irish interest rate should have been on average 6.5% higher. Using a BVAR and multivariate housing model, we provide econometric evidence that under an alternative sovereign monetary policy, the average house price would have been 25–30% lower just before the housing bust. In addition, it shows that a monetary policy tailored to the needs of the member state prevents housing prices from dramatically increasing.

TI  - Global Excess Liquidity and House Prices - A VAR Analysis for OECD Countries
AU  - Belke, Ansgar Hubertus
AU  - Orth, Walter
AB  - The belief that house prices are driven by specific regional and institutional variables and not at all by monetary conditions is so entrenched with some market participants and some commentators that the search for empirical support would seem to be a trivial task. However, this is not the case. This paper investigates the relationship between global excess liquidity and asset prices on a global scale: How important is global liquidity? How are asset (especially house) prices and other important macro variables like consumer prices affected by global monetary conditions? This paper analyses the international transmission of monetary shocks with a special focus on the effects of a global monetary aggregate (global liquidity) on consumer prices and different asset prices.We estimate a variety of VAR models for the global economy using aggregated data that represent the major OECD countries. The impulse responses show that a positive shock to global liquidity leads to permanent increases in the global GDP deflator and in the global house price index, while the latter reaction is even more distinctive. Moreover, we find that there are subsequent spillovers to consumer prices. In contrast, we are not able to find empirical evidence in favour of the hypothesis that the MSCIWorld index as a measure of stock prices significantly reacts to changes in global liquidity.

AB  - Global liquidity expansion has been very dynamic since 2001. Contrary to conventional wisdom, high money growth rates have not coincided with a concurrent rise in goods prices. At the same time, however, asset prices have increased sharply, significantly outpacing the subdued development in consumer prices. We investigate the interactions between money and goods and asset prices at the global level. Using aggregated data for major OECD countries, our VAR results support the view that different price elasticities on asset and goods markets explain the observed relative price change between asset classes and consumer goods.

AB  - We investigate the possibility that the Taylor rule should be formulated as a threshold process such that the Federal Reserve acts more aggressively in some circumstances than in others. It seems reasonable that the Federal Reserve would act more aggressively when inflation is high than when it is low. Similarly, it might be expected that the Federal Reserve responds more to a negative than a positive output gap. Although these specifications receive some empirical support, we find that a modified threshold model that is consistent with “opportunistic” monetary policy makes significant progress toward explaining Federal Reserve behavior.

AB  - This paper explores the importance of housing and mortgage market heterogeneity in 12 European countries for the transmission of monetary policy. We use a panel VAR model which is estimated over the period 1995-2006 to generate impulse responses of key macroeconomic variables to a monetary policy shock. We propose a data-driven approach that splits our panel of countries into two disjoint groups according to the impact of the monetary policy shock on real house prices. Our results show that in countries with a more pronounced reaction of real house prices the propagation of monetary policy shocks to macroeconomic variables is amplified.

TI  - Are Monetary Unions More Synchronous than Non-Monetary Unions?
AU  - Crowley, Patrick M.

AB  - Within currency unions, the conventional wisdom is that there should be a high degree of macroeconomic synchronicity between the constituent parts of the union. But this conjecture has never been formally tested by comparing sample of monetary unions with a control sample of countries that do not belong to a monetary union. In this paper we take euro area data, US State macro data, Canadian provincial data and Australian state data — namely real Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth, the GDP deflator growth and unemployment rate data — and use techniques relating to recurrence plots to measure the degree of synchronicity in dynamics over time using a dissimilarity measure. The results show that for the most part monetary unions are more synchronous than non-monetary unions, but that this is not always the case and particularly in the case of real GDP growth. Furthermore, Australia is by far the most synchronous monetary union in our sample.

TI  - DID MONETARY POLICY KILL THE PHILLIPS CURVE? SOME SIMPLE ARITHMETICS
AU  - Bergholt, D

AU  - Vaccaro-Grange, E
AB  - Price inflation in the U.S. economy has been remarkably stable over the past 25 years, in spite of large fluctuations in real economic activity. This observation has led some to believe that the Phillips curve has flattened. We argue that this viewpoint may be premature unless one accounts explicitly for all supply-side variation in data. In fact, we show that it is crucial to control for an entire array of supply shocks (and not only cost-push shocks) when evaluating alternative explanations for the puzzling behavior of inflation. Equipped with a combination of New Keynesian theory and SVAR models, we decompose the unconditional variation in data into the components driven by demand and supply, respectively. This allows us to conduct a simple yet novel accounting exercise, which reveals that the Phillips curve remains relatively stable once supply shocks are properly controlled for. The demand curve, in contrast, has flattened substantially. Our results are fully consistent with an explanation based on a more aggressive monetary policy response to inflation.

TI  - Measuring Monetary Policy in Open Economies
AU  - Cerdeiro, Diego
AB  - The paper extends Bernanke and Mihov's [6] closed-economy strategy for identification of monetary policy shocks to open-economy settings, accounting for the simultaneity between interest-rate and exchange-rate innovations. The methodology allows a separate treatment of two distinct monetary policy shocks, one that operates through open market operations, and another one that takes place through interventions in the foreign exchange market. Implementation of this strategy to the case of Argentina provides the stylized facts necessary to choose among competing theoretical models of this economy. In addition to studying the effects of monetary policy innovations, the present study sheds light on the endogenous component of monetary policy. In this regard, the paper finds that, notwithstanding the relative stability of the exchange rate and the accumulation of large amounts of international reserves, the central bank in Argentina has been far from absorbing balance of payments shocks in a currency-board fashion. The growing level of international reserves can be rationalized, instead, as the monetary authority's response to terms of trade, supply and domestic currency demand shocks.

T2  - Annals of Financial Economics
AB  - The ongoing global financial turmoil has revived the question of whether central bankers ought to tighten monetary policy pre-emptively in order to head off asset price misalignments before a sudden crash triggers financial instability. This study explores the issue of the appropriate monetary policy response to asset price swings in the small open economy of Singapore. Empirical analysis of monetary policy based on standard vector autoregression (VAR) models, unfortunately, is often hindered by the use of sparse information sets. To better reflect the extensive information monitored by Singapore's central bank, including global economic indicators, we augment a monetary vector autoregression (VAR) model with common factors extracted from a large panel dataset spanning 122 economic time series and the period 1980q1–2008q2. The resulting FAVAR model is used to assess the impact of monetary policy shocks on residential property and stock prices. Impulse response functions and variance decompositions suggest that monetary policy can potentially be used to lean against asset price booms in Singapore.

AB  - This chapter estimates a simple model of the Federal Reserve's "reaction function"—that is, the relationship between economic developments and the Fed's response to them. It provides an estimation of reaction functions for three separate empirical subsamples delineated by the identity of the Fed Chairman. Specifically, the chapter consider the terms of Arthur Burns (1970.Q1-1978.Q1), Paul Volcker (1979.Q3-1987.Q2), and Alan Greenspan (1987.Q3-present). The organizing principle for the investigation is the Taylor rule, which is used as a rough gauge for characterizing and evaluating the broad differences in the relative weights given to monetary policy goal variables between periods. The chapter looks at several issues in estimating a reaction function based on the Taylor rule, including the specification of dynamics, the equilibrium real rate, the inflation target, and the output gap.

T2  - Economic Stagnation in Japan
AB  - Dongchul Cho examines Korea’s recent monetary policy in comparison with Japan’s experiences in the 1990s. As in Japan, the Bank of Korea’s forecasts were excessively optimistic during the 2012 to 2015 period, resulting in conservative monetary policy, while Korea differs from Japan in having a milder pace of disinflation and a low likelihood of a real estate bubble-bust. Nonetheless, conservative policy based on past experiences could become risky in a rapidly changing environment, particularly with Korea’s rapid aging and declining potential growth. The answer to the question, whether Korea with a lag of two decades will follow Japan into deflation, lies in future monetary policy.

This study proposes a novel method to estimate the shadow rate using survey forecasts of macroeconomic variables and allowing the shadow rate to be negative even when the short-term rate is positive. The estimated U.S. shadow rate remained negative in 201517, when the Federal Reserve continued to hike its policy rate but kept its holdings of assets at sizable levels. The shadow spread, which is defined as the shadow rate minus the short-term rate, is negatively correlated with the Federal Reserve’s holdings of assets, particularly mortgage-backed securities. The impact of the unconventional monetary policy on inflation was 0.5 percentage points at its peak.

AB  - To what extent does the availability of credit depend on monetary policy? And, does this relationship vary with bank characteristics? Based on a common source of balance sheet data for the four largest economies of the eurozone over the period 1999–2011, we find that the effects of monetary policy on bank lending are significant and heterogeneous in Germany and Italy – which are characterized by a large number of banks – but are weaker and more homogeneous in Spain and France – whose banking industry has a higher degree of market concentration. In particular, monetary policy appears to exert larger effects on cooperative and savings banks with lower liquidity and lesser capital in Germany and savings banks with smaller size in Italy. Our results highlight that the transmission of monetary policy over bank lending in the eurozone is highly heterogeneous. From a policy perspective, the increased large number of cooperative and savings banks, which have had access during the last financial crisis to the refinancing operations of the European Central Bank, bodes well for the improvement of the monetary transmission mechanism. The analysis also suggests that competition policy measures aiming at reducing entry barrier might facilitate the transmission mechanism.— Roberto A. De Santis and Paolo Surico

TI  - Responding to the Monetary Superpower
AU  - Gray, Colin
AB  - Between 2002 and 2006, the United States Federal Reserve set interest rates significantly
below the rates suggested by well-known monetary policy rules. There is a growing body
of research suggesting that this helped fuel an excess of liquidity in the U.S. that
contributed to the 2008 worldwide financial crash. What is less well known is that a
number of other central banks also lowered interest rates during this period. An important
question, then, is what role the Federal Reserve played in influencing other central banks
to alter their own monetary policies, which could have magnified the Fed’s actions in
creating global liquidity. This paper addresses the issue by showing how spillovers in
central bank behavior occur in theoretical rational expectations models. It then establishes
empirically how U.S. monetary policy actions affect the actions of other major central
banks, particularly in terms of interest rates and currency interventions. The data suggest
that the U.S. lowering its policy rate, in general or in reference to a specific monetary
policy rule, influences other central banks to lower their own policy rates and intervene in
currency markets, even when controlling for worldwide macroeconomic trends. Finally,
this paper shows that spillovers from U.S. actions are partially responsible for the
worldwide lowering of interest rates and the increase in currency reserves in the early
2000’s that may have contributed to the subsequent worldwide liquidity boom.

TI  - Monetary Policy Thrust for Inclusive Growth in Nigeria
AU  - Ajakaiye, O.

T2  - Journal of Economics and Policy Analysis
AB  - Economic growth in Nigeria has taken an upward trend in the last one decade. However, the growth has been regarded as non-inclusive, given the rising rates in unemployment, poverty incidence and income inequality. Although monetary policy has a role to play in fostering inclusive growth, it has had limited influence on Nigeria’s economy due to its weak productive structure. In addition, monetary policy has managed inflation solely as a demand -pull phenomenon when, in reality, cost-push factors have activated it through the supply-side of the economy by increasing the cost of production. Increased monetary policy rate is transmitted into the bank lending rate which, in turn, is passed onto the cost of production. This cost is then passed onto the consumers in the form of high product prices. The impact is often quite significant, given the heavy reliance of producers on financial resources and services in the production process. Consequently, monetary policy should be proactive to ensure inclusive growth by re-allocating resources from one sector to another, or from one industry to another without increasing the cost of production, especially the cost of credit.

There is strong evidence of temporal instability in the GARCH process, and the variability tradeoff is more apparent for the post-October 1979 subperiod. The slope of the tradeoff, nevertheless, appears to be considerably flat.

AB  - The public finance management system is an important lever for equalizing financial and budgetary disproportions in the context of institutional changes. The paper aims to substantiate the directions of development of the public financial management system. Economic and statistical methods and correlation-regression analysis methods are used to determine the relationship between the GDP deflator and the share of revenues, expenditures, the general government budget deficit, and public debt in GDP, assessing the features of the public financial management system in Ukraine and EU countries. This study reveals that one of the main restraining factors in the public finance system development is a significant level of uncertainty in economic processes, which intensifies macroeconomic fluctuations, significant indicators of the share of public debt and budget deficit of the state administration sector pose risks to financial and economic stability; their potential negative impact on socio-economic processes is much more destructive than the pro-cyclical nature of fiscal policy. From this point of view, the public finance management system should be directed at optimizing financial and budgetary tools to prevent the growth of public debt and budget deficit in gross domestic product, which determines the importance of substantiating further development directions of the public financial management system. It is concluded that the mechanism of public financial management in recent years is quite rigid and restrictive, in the context of institutional change expands the tools of public financial management and increases its impact on socio-economic processes.

TI  - Monetary Policy Shocks and Foreign Investment Income: Evidence from a large Bayesian VAR
AU  - Auer, Simone
AB  - This paper assesses the transmission of monetary policy in a large Bayesian vector autoregression based on the approach proposed by Banbura, Giannone and Reichlin (2010). The paper analyzes the impact of monetary policy shocks in the United States and Canada not only on a range of domestic aggregates, trade ows, and exchange rates, but also foreign investment income. The analysis provides three main results. First, a surprise monetary policy action has a statistically and economically signicant impact on both gross and net foreign investment income ows in both countries. Against the background of growing foreign wealth and investment income, this result provides preliminary evidence that foreign balance-sheet channels might play an increasingly important role for monetary transmission. Second, the impact of monetary policy on foreign investment income ows diﬀers considerably across asset categories and over time, suggesting that the investment instruments and the currency denomination of a country’s foreign assets and liabilities are potentially relevant for the way in which monetary policy aﬀects the domestic economy. Finally, the results support existing evidence on the eﬀectiveness of large vector autoregressions and the Bayesian shrinkage approach in addressing the curse of dimensionality and eliminating price and exchange rate puzzles.

It is shown that Euro area money and prices can be considered as variables that are integrated of order two or I(2), that is, they have to be differenced twice to become stationary. Accordingly, the relation between money, prices and other macroeconomic variables is analyzed in an econometric framework which is suited for the analysis of I(2)-variables. Monetary policy implications are derived from the estimated system.

AB  - It is known that stock returns are affected by monetary policy. This paper theoretically and empirically investigates whether asymmetric information between the Federal Reserve and the public causes the relation between stock returns and monetary policy actions. The paper concludes that asymmetric information between the Federal Reserve and the public is one of the reasons of effects of monetary policy actions on stock returns. A Kalman filter algorithm is constructed to analyze the information and learning dynamics between the Federal Reserve and a representative investor. Stock prices react to monetary policy actions because monetary policy actions reveal the private information that the Fed has about future inflation and output. Investors update their expectations after observing the Fed's actions and that produces a change in stock returns. The findings of the model are empirically investigated using VAR and impulse responses verify the theoretical findings

AB  - This study investigates the macroeconomic consequences of firm-level accounting conservatism. Consistent with conditional conservatism extending to the aggregate level, I demonstrate that annual estimates of aggregate corporate profits and gross domestic product compiled by the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis are more sensitive to negative aggregate news than to positive aggregate news. Next, I estimate the dollar value impact of conservatism on measurements of macroeconomic fundamentals. Finally, I show that incorporating the dollar value impact of conservatism increases the explanatory power of a monetary policy reaction function that describes U.S. Federal Reserve interest rate decision behavior. These results suggest that accounting can impact social welfare by altering the measurement attributes of key macroeconomic indicators and by shaping monetary policy decisions that regulate the money supply.JEL Classifications: M41; E43; E52.

Most models currently used for macroeconomic analysis exclude money or else model money demand as entirely endogenous. Nevertheless, academic research and many textbooks continue to use the money multiplier concept in discussions of money. We explore the institutional structure of the transmission mechanism beginning with open market operations through to money and loans to document that the mechanism does not work through the standard multiplier model or the bank lending channel. Our analysis, however, does not reflect on the existence of a broader credit channel.

T2  - Review of Development Economics
AB  - The strong economic ties between the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) economies and the USA are manifested in three ways: currency peg, coupling of monetary policy, and the adoption of the US dollar as the trading currency for oil. This paper examines how these dynamics result in a misalignment of the US monetary policy with the business cycles of the GCC economies. The study shows how the staggering amount of remittances outflow of the GCC economies plays a stabilizing role as a tacit monetary policy tool. Incorporating remittances in the money-demand equation results in a more robust model than otherwise. We further find that the effect of the Federal Funds rate on money demand in these countries diminishes in significance during the period of oil boom between 2002 and 2009. However, the transmission effect of the recession periods in the USA into the demand for money in the GCC countries is not statistically significant.

AB  - We investigate the existence and timing of changes in U.S. inflation persistence. To do so, we develop an unobserved components model of inflation with Markov-switching parameters and we measure persistence using impulse response functions based on the model. An important feature of our model is its allowance for multiple regime shifts in parameters related to the size and propagation of shocks. Inflation persistence depends on the configuration of these parameters, although it need not change even if the parameters change. Using the GDP deflator for the sample period of 1959-2006, we find that U.S. inflation underwent two sudden permanent regime shifts, both of which corresponded to changes in persistence. The first regime shift occurred around the collapse of the Bretton Woods system at the beginning of the 1970's and produced an increase in inflation persistence, while the second regime shift occurred immediately after the Volcker disinflation in the early 1980's and produced a decrease in inflation persistence. Meanwhile, consistent with the New Keynesian Phillips Curve, the gap between inflation and its long-run trend displayed little or no persistence throughout the entire sample period.

TI  - Globalization, inflation and monetary policy
AU  - Fatima, Kaneez
AB  - The thesis is aimed at investigating the implications of globalization for the conduct of monetary policy. By globalization we mean increased interdependence of national economies as reflected in greater and freer flow of goods, services, capital, and labour across national borders. In particular, our research addresses a number of important issues in the recent monetary policy and globalization debate. First, are global factors becoming important drivers of domestic inflation? Second, are global factors playing more powerful role on inflation dynamics in the sectors of an economy that are more open to trade? Third, has globalization made the job of Central Bankers more difficult? And finally, do the Central Bankers in the United States and the United Kingdom consider international factors too along with domestic factors while determining the short term interest rates?

Inflation rates have been observed to be low across industrial countries since the early 1990s. The co-movements of inflation rates across countries are strikingly  high. We model the co-movements of inflation rates by a global factor, regional factors and idiosyncratic component. In particular, we estimate a Dynamic Factor Model with Stochastic Volatility and find that the contribution of the global factor has increased over time in explaining the variance of inflation in OECD countries.  The regional factor also gains importance in countries with strong intra-regional economic linkages potentially due to proliferation of regional trade agreements and common currency areas. In the European countries, the role of global and regional factor together dominates the country specific factor since the late 1990s. The volatility of inflation has substantially decreased over time and our modelling framework incorporates time varying volatility of inflation. We find strong positive and significant relationship between the international common factor and economic globalization.  
  
Consistent with inflation becoming a global phenomenon, co-movements of aggregate inflation between countries are observed to be high. We examine whether this is also the case for sectoral inflation, we model the co-movements in sectoral inflation as being associated with a global factor, a sector specific factor and an idiosyncratic error term. We find that the co-movements of inflation of tradable sectors are substantially greater than the co-movements in non-tradable sectors which implies that the greater co-movements of inflation can be attributed to increased trade global integration of product markets. To test this, we attempt to find empirical relationship between the estimated common factor in sectors and openness to trade measured as import penetration. A positive relationship is found between the estimated sector specific common factors and import penetration.      

Given our earlier chapters identify important global dimension to aggregate and sectoral inflation, does this matter for monetary policy? The implication of globalization for monetary policy in the United States and the United Kingdom are examined by estimating monetary policy reaction function for these advanced economies over the sample period 1985-2010. We also consider time variations in these reaction function by estimating over a sub-sample of 1992-2010 for the United Kingdom and the Greenspan-Bernanke Era for the United States. We estimate the policy reaction function with domestic and global inflation and output gaps and with the component of domestic inflation and output gap that is not related to global variations. The policy reaction function augmented with foreign variables such as real effective exchange rate and foreign interest rate is also estimated. We use measures of inflation based on GDP deflator, CPI and inflation expectations. We find that the Federal Reserve responds to global inflation only in the full sample and to global as well as the country specific inflation in the second sub-sample (Greenspan-Bernanke Era). This may imply strong commitment of the Federal Reserve to the goal of ``price stability'' during Greenspan-Bernanke Era. The Bank of England responds to global inflation along with the country specific inflation.  The international factors such as the real effective exchange rate changes (depreciation) and foreign interest rates have significant and positive effect on policy rates.

AB  - Ridge regression and Lasso refer to two types of regression methods that make up some defects existing in OLS, like OLS regression estimator does not uniquely exit when 𝑥𝑥<sup><i>T</i></sup> is singular, by regularization. This paper reviews and compares the ideas of OLS, ridge regression and Lasso, and sums their main development and previous scholars’ study results. This paper presents that ridge regression adds the 𝑙<sub>2</sub> penalty term as a constraint, and Lasso adds the 𝑙<sub>1</sub> penalty so that it has a function of select variables, some weakly relative variables’ correlated coefficient is reduced to zero directly. By comparing to OLS, ridge regression and Lasso are biased so the choice of these three requires people to consider the specific situation of use. Facing the problem of short-term hysteresis in the calculation of GDP deflator, this paper uses ridge regression and Lasso in GDP deflator analysis by the regression model of GDP deflator with 14 variables, and compares their results with OLS’s. Meanwhile, post Lasso estimator is included to solve the problem of bias at the end, and the conclusion shows the core inflation is the most economically significant variable to GDP deflator in current period estimation.

TI  - Monetary Policy Rules Under Heterogeneous Inflation Expectations
AU  - Brissimis, Sophocles N.
AU  - Magginas, Nicholas
AB  - This paper evaluates the role of inflation-forecast heterogeneity in US monetary policy making. The deviation between private and central bank inflation forecasts is identified as a factor increasing inflation persistence and thus calling for a policy reaction. An optimal policy rule is derived by the minimization under discretion of a standard central bank loss function subject to a Phillips curve, modified to include the forecast deviation, and a forward-looking aggregate demand equation. This rule, which itself includes the forecast deviation as an additional argument, is estimated for the period 1974-1998, covering the Chairmanships of Arthur Burns, Paul Volcker and Alan Greenspan, by using real-time forecasts of inflation and the output gap obtained from the FOMC’s Greenbook and the Survey of Professional Forecasters. The estimated rule remains remarkably stable over the whole sample period, challenging the conventional view of a structural break following Volcker’s appointment as Chairman of the Fed. Finally, the substantial decline in the significance of the interest-rate smoothing term in the rule indicates that monetary policy inertia may, to a large extent, be an artifact of serially correlated inflation-forecast errors that feed into policy decisions in real time.

AB  - The Pure Expectations Hypothesis (PEH) serves as the benchmark model for the relationship between yields on bonds of different maturities. When coupled with rational expectations, however, empirical renderings of the model fail miserably. I explore the possibility that failure to account for changes in monetary policy regime explains much of the failure of the PEH. Estimating changing monetary regimes in conjunction with the PEH significantly improves its performance. The predicted spread between the long and short rates is highly correlated with the actual spread. The standard deviation of the theoretical spread is nearly identical to that of the actual spread.

TI  - Political Influence on Fiscal and Monetary Policy in Sub-Saharan Africa
AU  - Neumann, Rebecca

AB  - This article examines the extent to which political variables affect budget deficits, money growth and inflation in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). Using the Arellano–Bond dynamic panel data analysis on 36 SSA countries from 1980 to 2010, we first characterise the impact of presidential elections on two policy variables: government budget deficits and money growth. We then examine the impact of government budget deficits and money growth on inflation, while taking account of any direct political pressure via presidential elections. Importantly, we show that country groups, based on the level of income, are important in teasing out the varying effects of budget deficits and elections, finding evidence of political budget cycles and political monetary cycles in the middle-income countries. We also characterise whether a country is part of a fixed-exchange rate regime, showing that this limits electoral pressure on the monetary policy variable. We examine the competitiveness of elections by whether they are multiparty or single-party elections and by whether there is an incumbent candidate running for re-election. When we examine the feed-on effects on inflation, there is little indication that the election pressures on either fiscal or monetary variables become inflationary. There is evidence, however, of money growth and budget deficits being directly inflationary, particularly in the low-income countries.
