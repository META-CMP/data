TI  - BOJ's non-traditional monetary policies and their effects on the Japanese economy: comments and views on Harada
AU  - Hayashi, Naotsugu
T2  - International Journal of Economic Policy Studies
AB  - Since January 2013, the Abe administration had advocated Abenomics, which proposed three arrows: bold monetary easing, flexible fiscal policy, and growth strategy stimulating investment. In response, from April 2013, the Bank of Japan announced bold monetary easing, including maintaining zero interest rates, large-scale purchases of government bonds, positive and negative interest rates on excess reserves, yield curve control, and other measures. As a result, compared with the average real growth rate of 1.6% during the Izanami–Koizumi boom and that of 1.63% during the Democratic government, it had risen to 2.1% only in 2013, the first year of the Abe administration, and it seemed that the economy had been revitalized. However, right after the consumption tax hike in April 2014, the Japanese economy fell down to negative growth of real GDP in the three consecutive quarters, causing the consumption tax hike recession. The average real growth rate from then to the second quarter of 2019 had fallen to 1.1%, which was lower than those during the Izanami–Koizumi boom and the Democratic government. In terms of the Consumer Price Index, deflation continued at an average rate of − 0.5% during the Izanami–Koizumi boom and the Democratic era, but the Abe administration recovered it to an average rate of 0.8%, and it can be said that deflation has almost ended. But it is far from achieving the 2% inflation target. Harada (Int J Econ Policy Stud (Forthcoming), 2020) briefly explained the various measures of the BOJ's unconventional monetary policies. It analyzes what effects they have on the Japanese economy and insists that they had positive effects on employment, productivity, and capital investment in particular, but zero and negative interest rates are partly a consequence of past deflationary monetary policy and are a global trend. Then, it proposes to maintain the present policies. However, Harada does not explain clear reasons why the BOJ could not achieve the 2% inflation target. This article gives comments and views on important key issues of non-traditional monetary policies raised by Harada (2020), tries to clarify the reasons why the BOJ could not achieve the 2% inflation target and proposes desirable new policy measures to achieve the inflation target, to raise real growth rate and to restore monetary normalization.

AB  - We employ a parsimonious nonlinear Interacted-VAR to examine whether the real effects of uncertainty shocks are greater when the economy is at the Zero Lower Bound. We find the contractionary effects of uncertainty shocks to be statistically larger when the ZLB is binding, with differences that are economically important. Our results are shown not to be driven by the contemporaneous occurrence of the Great Recession and high financial stress, and to be robust to different ways of modeling unconventional monetary policy. These findings lend support to recent theoretical contributions on the interaction between uncertainty shocks and the stance of monetary policy.

AU  - Bacchiocchi, Emanuele

T2  - Oxford Bulletin of Economics and Statistics
AB  - A growing line of research makes use of structural changes and different volatility regimes found in the data in a constructive manner to improve the identification of structural parameters in structural vector autoregressions (SVARs). A standard assumption made in the literature is that the reduced form unconditional error covariance matrix varies while the structural parameters remain constant. Under this hypothesis, it is possible to identify the SVAR without needing to resort to additional restrictions. With macroeconomic data, the assumption that the transmission mechanism of the shocks does not vary across volatility regimes is debatable. We derive novel necessary and sufficient rank conditions for local identification of SVARs, where both the error covariance matrix and the structural parameters are allowed to change across volatility regimes. Our approach generalizes the existing literature on ‘identification through changes in volatility’ to a broader framework and opens up interesting possibilities for practitioners. An empirical illustration focuses on a small monetary policy SVAR of the US economy and suggests that monetary policy has become more effective at stabilizing the economy since the 1980s.

T2  - Journal of Economics Library
AB  - . It is a debatable issue that high and variable inflation causes the well fare loss while on the other side reducing inflation generally has some cost and the amount of that cost is measured by the sacrifice ratio. Therefore inflation output trade off is important for central banks when formulating policy. Sacrifice ratio is the main indicator to measure the real cost of disinflation, calculated as the ratio of the cumulative percentage output loss (the difference between actual and potential output) to the size of disinflation. Thus, the sacrifice ratio measures the real output cost per unit of permanent decrease in inflation. Sacrifice ratio is basically divided into two main categories, time invariant sacrifice ratio and episode specific sacrifice ratio. In time invariant sacrifice ratio we took Philips Curve, structural VAR and in episode specific ratio we took Ball method of sacrifice ratio and Zhang method of sacrifice ratio. We found positive sacrifice ratio in almost all the methods but the magnitude of the sacrifice ratio is not large and the estimates of sacrifice ratio are sensitive to different estimation method.Keywords.

AB  - Economy of Pakistan has witnessed several inflationary episodes and voluminous literature has been presented in
this regard but no specific attention has been given to the impact of crude oil prices on inflation in Pakistan. This
research is particularly aimed to determine the existence and intensity of relation between crude oil price and
inflation in Pakistan. Moreover the study also investigates other determinants of inflation in Pakistan. Effects of
crude oil price on GDP deflator have been analyzed using time series data from 1979 to 2012. For long run and short
run results Johansen Co-integration techniques have been employed for estimation. The study concludes that Money
Supply, Crude Oil Price, Exchange Rate, Interest rate and Indirect taxes have positive while real GDP has negative
impact on inflation during the study period.

T2  - Empirical Economics
AB  - This research contributes to the literature on the effects of fiscal and monetary policy by exploiting non-Gaussianity of the time series for the identification of a Bayesian structural vector autoregression model. Using quarterly US data from 1954:IV to 2006:IV and from 1985:I to 2020:III, we formally assess the plausibility of theoretically predicted signs to label fiscal policy, monetary policy, and business cycle shocks. The impulse responses of consumption to the fiscal policy shock depend to some extent on the sample period, but the implied fiscal multiplier is always less than unity. On investment, there is a lagging crowding-out effect with a high probability, but it is not strongly evident in the latter sample. As for the responses after a contractionary monetary policy shock, we find a weakening output after some lags consistent with the leading monetary policy literature. The business cycle shock turns out to matter for government spending only in the long run, while it is already important for the federal funds rate in the short run.

T3  - Global Governance and Financial Stability
AB  - We contribute to the empirical literature on the risk-management approach to monetary policy by estimating regime switching models where the strength of the response of monetary policy to macroeconomic conditions depends on the level of risk associated with the inflation outlook and risk in financial markets. Using quarterly data for the Greenspan period we find that: (i) risk in the inflation outlook and in financial markets are a more powerful driver of monetary policy regime changes than variables typically suggested in the literature, such as the level of inflation and the output gap; (ii) estimation of regime switching models shows that the response of the US Fed to the inflation outlook is invariant across policy regimes; (iii) however, in periods of high economic risk monetary policy tends to respond more aggressively to the output gap and the degree of inertia tends to be lower than in normal circumstances; and (iv) the US Fed is estimated to have responded aggressively to the output gap in the late 1980s and beginning of the 1990s, and in the late 1990s and early 2000s. These results are consistent with Mishkin (2008)’s view that in periods of high economic risk monetary authorities should respond aggressively to changes in macroeconomic conditions while the degree of inertia should be lower than in normal circumstances.

AU  - Ike-Anikwe, Roseline Chizoba
AB  - The changing and unpredictable nature of the money demand function has led many Central Banks authorities around the world to shift from exchange rate and monetary policy targeting to inflation targeting framework. The gradual shift to inflation targeting has reawakened interest in the Taylor’s Rule which states that nominal anchor interest rate must be raised by more than a proportionate change in inflation to achieve price stability. The objective of this study is to examine the Central Bank of Nigeria monetary policy reaction function and how the CBN responds to the dynamic and evolving macroeconomic environment. The monetary policy response function developed for this study is derived following the basic structure of the Taylor’s rule. Using secondary time series data sourced from the Central Bank of Nigeria Statistical Bulletin covering the periods 1998:Q1-2014:Q2, the study builds on the Taylor rule to formulate a model that track the Central Bank of Nigeria monetary policy reaction function. The method adopted in carrying out the study is the Auto Regressive Distributed Lag Modeling technique and the Error Correction modeling framework. The stylized fact of the study shows that monetary policy variables are moving along same path accompanied by declining inflation and improved productivity. Results obtained from the study will be used to track stability and dynamics of the Central Bank reaction function and to predict the future direction for monetary policy in Nigeria.

Using different policy rules, we test whether the Bank of Russia reacts to changes in inflation, the output gap and the exchange rate in a consistent and predictable manner. Our results indicate that, during the period from 1993 to 2004, the Bank of Russia used monetary aggregates as the main policy instrument. Some estimations provide evidence that the Bank of Russia was more concerned with reducing inflation before 1995, while the priorities shifted towards exchange rate stabilization after 1995.

AB  - This paper focuses on the effects of fiscal policy in Spain analysed in a VAR context. Fiscal shocks are found to involve significant effects on GDP, private consumption, private investment, interest rates and prices. Non-Keynesian effects are observed. Moreover, evidence on the channels highlighted in the literature for such effects to arise is found, notably the effects of permanent income on consumption and investment on the demand side, coupled with the response of the equilibrium wage on the supply side affecting entrepreneurial profits and investment. The response of interest rates seems to reinforce both effects. Furthermore, the different readings of spending or taxes do not affect macroeconomic variables homogeneously.

AB  - I study how heterogeneity of financial frictions and monopolistic competition influence the pass through of the nominal interest rate to the real lending rate, its transmission into investment, and corporate cash holdings. Firms finance stochastic investment opportunities with either bank-issued credit or money. The market structure generates an aggregate demand externality which doubles transmission at the a policy rate of 4.8% and magnifies the effects of financial frictions on investment. In line with empirical evidence, the cash-to-sales ratio increases with the extent of financial constraints, and rises with the intensity of competition for financially constrained firms. Financial constraints raise firms’ sensitivity to monetary policy; and a mean-preserving spread of financial frictions reduces investment and output, strengthens transmission, and reduces the external share of finance.

AB  - The emergence of the bubble phenomenon in financial markets and its possible
burst causes a kind of uncertainty, and causes capital to leave productive markets.
Duo to these issues, policymakers seek to plan and implement appropriate policies
to deal with the crisis and respond promptly and correctly in these situations to
reduce or prevent the adverse effects of that. Considering that the Iranian stock
market, like other financial markets in other countries, is not immune from this
phenomenon, in this study by using the TVP-VAR model and extracting the
impulse- response functions and using quarterly data of Iran for variables like
interest rate, gross domestic product, gross domestic product deflator, consumer
price index, total stock price index and dividend per share, in the period 2003: 1 to
2019: 3, the effect of the relative size of stock price bubble component on the
effectiveness of monetary policy for reduction or eliminating the stock price bubble
component is simulated and the results show that when the size of the bubble
component is small, compared to the fundamental component, the application of
contractionary monetary policy can be effective in reducing the price bubble, but
when the price bubble is large, This contractionary monetary policy causes a larger
component of the price bubble and makes the situation worse. Furthermore the
results show that some variables like interest rate, gross domestic product, gross
domestic product deflator, dividend per share and fundamental component of price
have had almost stable patterns, but the stock price and its bubble component
response to the policy shock have not been stable over time and their negative
response to the monetary policy shock, have been decreased over time and in recent
years of sample, the stock price response and its bubble component, end up
increasing from the first period.

AB  - This paper provides evidence of a credit channel and a bank lending channel of monetary policy in the United States from 1980 to 1995. We test for bank loan supply shifts by segregating banks according to asset size and capital leverage ratio. The loan growth of small (under $300M) undercapitalized (capital-asset ratio <8%) banks, small (under $100M) adequately capitalized (8%<capital-asset ratio< 10%) banks, and small (under $50M) well-capitalized (capital-asset ratio > 10%) banks is significantly affected by policy. This has important implications for the strength and distributional effects of monetary policy, and for the link between stabilization and regulatory policy.

T2  - NBER Macroeconomics Annual
AB  - Based on a sample of 104 countries, we document four key stylized facts regarding the interaction among capital flows, fiscal policy, and monetary policy. First, net capital inflows are procyclical (i.e., external borrowing increases in good times and falls in bad times) in most Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) and developing countries. The procyclicality of net capital inflows is particularly strong for middle-high-income countries (emerging markets). Second, fiscal policy is procyclical (i.e., government spending increases in good times and falls in bad times) for the majority of developing countries. Third, for emerging markets, monetary policy appears to be procyclical (i.e., policy rates are lowered in good times and raised in bad times). Fourth, in developing countries-and particularly for emerging markets-periods of capital inflows are associated with expansionary macroeconomic policies and periods of capital outflows with contractionary macroeconomic policies. In such countries, therefore, when it rains, it does indeed pour.

TI  - Predicting Inflation—A Holistic Approach
AU  - Avdiu, Kujtim

T2  - Journal of Risk and Financial Management
AB  - The quantity equation is a well-established, theoretic, long-run concept that has been criticized for a variety of reasons, i.e., that no precise statements about causality or dynamics between money growth and inflation can be inferred from its components. These shortcomings can be tackled by estimating inflation based upon a holistic approach and the performance of a ceteris paribus analysis for various levels of quantity and velocity of money, as well as GDP. By testing the validity of the quantity equation, it is possible to evaluate possible effects of elevated budget deficits, unprecedented expansions of the monetary base caused by global lockdowns, and a crash in global productivity, on inflation. The main findings of this paper suggest that the level of productivity is the main driver of inflation. The quantity and velocity of money only play a subordinate role in the determination of the inflation level. If inflation is holistically seen as a function of the quantity and velocity of money, as well as general economic productivity, the level of inflation can be very well explained by comparing the supply side with general economic productivity.

TI  - Fiscal Policy and Growth
AU  - Fu, Dong
AB  - In the literature neither taxes, government spending nor deficits are robustly correlated
with economic growth when evaluated individually. The lack of correlation may arise from the
inability of any single budgetary component to fully capture the stance of fiscal policy. We use
pair-wise combinations of fiscal indicators to assess the relationship between fiscal policy and
U.S. growth.
We develop a VAR methodology for evaluating simultaneous shocks to more than one
variable and use it to examine the impulse responses for simultaneous, unexpected and
equivalent structural shocks to pair-wise combinations of fiscal indicators. We also exploit the
identity relationship between taxes, spending and deficits and follow Sims and Zha (1998) to
evaluate an unexpected structural shock to one included fiscal indicator, holding constant the
other included indicator. We find that an increase in the size of federal government leads to
slower economic growth, that the deficit is an unreliable indicator of the stance of fiscal policy,
and that tax revenues are the most consistent indicator of fiscal policy.

AU  - Apergis, Nicholas
T2  - Economic Modelling
AB  - This study examines the role of policy and technological risk on U.S. stock returns. The results will highlight the effect of economic policy uncertainty on stock returns, given that such uncertainty rose to historically high levels after the recession of 2007–2009. In our case, uncertainty is related to tax, spending, and monetary policies. To identify the effect of different uncertainties (shocks) related to stochastic driving processes on stock returns, the empirical methodology allows factors relative to capital and labour tax rates, government spending, monetary policy and total factor productivity to play a leading role in the process of affecting stock returns, whereas the econometric methodology builds upon the stochastic volatility in mean (TVP-SVM) model by Koopman and Hol Uspensky (2002). The empirical findings document the importance of both policy and technological risks, especially after the recent financial crisis event. The findings also carry substantial implications for asset pricing modelling, indicating not only the time-varying character of shocks but also the asymmetric effect of such shocks on stock returns.

AB  - Inflation targets were introduced in the 1990s in Australia, Canada, New Zealand, Sweden and the United Kingdom. Change in the behavior of expected inflation in the five targeting countries is measured in a panel that includes six non-targeting countries: France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Japan and the United States. The level of expected inflation in targeting countries falls after the announcement of targets with controls for country effects, year effects, ongoing inflation reduction and the business cycle. Neither the variability of expected inflation nor the average absolute forecast error falls after the announcement of targets with controls for the level and variability of past inflation. Both targeting and non-targeting countries experience unexpected disinflation.

A2  - Knoester, A.

AB  - This chapter discusses the causes for the recent failure of U.S. monetary policy. The very slow growth of the broad money supply has been a primary source of U.S. economic weakness in 1990 through 1992. The velocity link between M2 and the subsequent level of nominal GDP has not declined. But changes in bank reserves brought about by open-market operations have had much less effect on M2 than the Fed anticipated for two reasons: (1 ) reserve requirements now apply to only a small fraction of total M2 and (2) the new bank capital requirements limit some banks' ability to lend. The Federal Reserve failed to appreciate the importance of these conditions and misjudged the strength of the monetary policy stimulus that it was providing. The new bank capital standards may be the primary reason for the reduced sensitivity of M2, of commercial bank lending, and of total nominal spending to changes in open market operations and interest rates. In uncertain environment, the FOMC acted in an overly cautious way, in part because of their reliance on a variety of misleading indicators of the stance of monetary policy. Avoiding future failures of U.S. monetary policy, both in stimulating expansion and in preventing inflation, requires more accurate indicators of the condition of monetary policy and alternative reserve requirement rules that permit tighter links between open market operations and subsequent movements of the broad monetary aggregate.

In an empirical analysis conducted for the US economy, we consider alternative measures of economic activity and inﬂation, alternative assumptions to identify the monetary policy shock and various VAR speciﬁcations making use of contemporaneous and forward looking variables. All three issues are found to be important for the resolution of the price puzzle and a robust preferred speciﬁcation is proposed.

TI  - Fiscal Theory of Exchange Rate Determination:
AU  - Guney, Pelin Oge
AB  - In this paper we empirically test the effects of fiscal and monetary policies on real exchange rates for Turkey for the period 1990-2003. The analyzed period is characterized by large budget deficits, high and variable inflation rates. To assess the effects of fiscal and monetary polices on exchange rate we estimate a 5-variable VAR model for budget deficits, money supply, exchange rates, output, and interest rate differentials. The results suggest that expansionary fiscal policy appreciates real exchange rate whereas the effect of monetary shock is statistically insignificant. Innovations in interest rate differentials and output also cause to appreciation of Turkish Lira. The results of variance decomposition suggest that the effects of fiscal policy on real exchange rates are more pronounced than the effects of monetary policy. Our results are consistent with fiscal theory of exchange rates.

AU  - Galí, Jordi
AU  - Gambetti, Luca
AB  - Unconditional reduced form estimates of a conventional wage Phillips curve for the U.S. economy point to a decline in its slope coefficient in recent years, as well as a shrinking role of lagged price inflation in the determination of wage inflation. We provide estimates of a conditional wage Phillips curve, based on a structural decomposition of wage, price and unemployment data generated by a VAR with time varying coefficients, identified by a combination of long-run and sign restrictions. Our estimates show that the key qualitative findings from the unconditional reduced form regressions also emerge in the conditional evidence, suggesting that they are not entirely driven by endogeneity problems or possible changes over time in the importance of of wage markup shocks. The conditional evidence, however, suggests that actual changes in the slope of the wage Phillips curve may not have been as large as implied by the unconditional estimates.

Our results, based on a panel of four biggest Central European countries (the Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland and Slovakia) confirm significant and probably strong substitution between these loans. Restrictive monetary policy leads to a decrease in domestic currency lending but simultaneously accelerates foreign currency denominated loans. This makes the central bank’s job harder.

AB  - In response to the 2008–2009 crisis, faced with distressed financial intermediaries, the European Central Bank (ECB) embarked in longer term refinancing operations (LTROs) with full allotment. Using an estimated DSGE model with a frictional banking sector, we find that such liquidity injections have played a key role in averting a major credit crunch. A counterfactual analysis suggests that, absent these nonconventional measures, output, consumption, investment, and the GDP deflator would have been 2.5%, 0.5%, 9.7%, and 0.5% lower on average over 2009, respectively.

AB  - During the last two decades, Post Keynesian/Kaleckian distribution and growth models have gradually focused their attention on the effects that monetary policy and financial variables are likely to have on the macroeconomy. These models usually rely on the influence of debt, debt services and interest rate variations on the short-run and the long-run equilibrium. Nonetheless, very little attention has been paid to the empirical investigation of the major hypotheses made by this specific body of literature. The aim of this paper is to partly bridge this empirical gap. We have developed a simple Post Keynesian/Kaleckian macroeconomic model to set out the hypotheses that variations in interest payments are likely to negatively affect consumption, capital accumulation and income. Our econometric analysis uses panel data for a sample of ten OECD countries and assesses the relevance of these hypotheses

TI  - The Cost Channel Eﬀect of Monetary Policy in Korea
AU  - Yie, Myung-Soo
AB  - Contractionary monetary policy reduces the price level in the long run, but it is frequently observed that a positive interest rate shock raises the price level at a short horizon. Impulse response analysis and estimation of an interest rate augmented Phillips curve in Korea indicate the existence of a cost channel eﬀect of monetary policy before the currency crisis period. Based upon these empirical results, this paper develops a dynamic stochastic general equilibrium model in order to explain the price responses in Korea. The cost channel of monetary policy transmission is a key feature in the model. Moreover, in order to examine the role of the banking sector in the monetary policy transmission given cost channel, an explicit loan production function in the banking sector is introduced. I ﬁnd from policy simulation that the cost channel eﬀect of monetary policy has fallen dramatically since the currency crisis in 1997. The model suggests that this result comes mainly from the facts that it takes longer for ﬁrms to adjust their output prices, and that the capital adjustment cost has declined since the currency crisis. I also ﬁnd that, despite the existence of the cost channel, when the banking sector supplies loans eﬃciently, monetary policy has an eﬀect on the economy mainly through the changing of aggregate demand. This implies that, given the existence of the cost channel, the central bank can reduce undesirable output price movements by enhancing the eﬃciency of the banking sector.

AB  - Our analysis sheds light on the issue of whether the monetary policy contributed to the recent housing boom and bust. We have estimated and analysed a model that allows a comparison between the actual policy and several alternative Taylor rules. When the Taylor rule path was computed using revised data and the deflator for the GDP, we found a notable impact on key housing market variables, supporting Taylor’s critique of the Fed policy. However, the bulk of our evidence suggests that the policy as it would have been conducted under our real-time Taylor rules would not have had any significant impact on the housing market variables. This conclusion is robust with regard to the price index used as well as the relative weights used on the inflation and output gaps.

Structuralists contend that changes in money supply (M3) and inflation (CPI) are not significantly related to changes in economic growth (GDP), while orthodox economists argue that they are. Stucturalists also hold that monetary authorities cannot control M3, whereas orthodox economists believe they can. To structuralists, when monetary authorities pursue an expansionary policy, the opposite effect is achieved. Orthodox economists counter this argument. The ADT test statistic against the McKinnon critical values was used and it was found (i) that money supply changes and inflation are significantly related to changes in economic growth, and (ii) whereas monetary authorities can control M3 through the repo rate, they cannot keep it within set targets.

AB  - This paper examines the relationship between financial stability, monetary policy, and economic growth in 40 developed and developing countries by using the annual panel data over the period of 1993–2015. Fixed and random effects panel data regression models were fitted to determine the impact of financial stability and monetary policy on economic growth. Our results indicate that trade openness, capital account openness, and foreign direct investment have positive impacts on economic growth with a high degree in developed countries. Our empirical results also indicate a positive and significant impact of research and development on financial development as well as economic growth in developed countries. Financial crises, bank liquid reserves, and bank nonperforming loans affect negatively financial stability, financial development, as well as economic growth. This impact essentially amounts to the sensitivity and fragility of the banking system. In addition, inflation continues to affect economic growth in a negative way. The main findings confirm the complementarity and the importance of real, financial, monetary variables and bank solidity as well their significant impacts on financial stability and economic development.

We extend a two-asset model to a three-asset one by adding the bond market under the variation of parameters and show that the impact of monetary expansion on inflation is complete in the two-asset model but is not complete in the three-asset model. Moreover, we find that in both of these models, the impact of monetary policy (or equivalently inflation) on the economic growth is ambiguous due to the fiscal policy intervention, and public expectations play crucial roles for the effectiveness and transmission of monetary policy in economic growth models. Finally, we show that our models are stable.

In this regard, we exploit monthly data covering the period January 2002-June 2017 and implement cointegration analysis and VEC model. The empirical results suggest that monetary tools exploited by the central bank of Lebanon depress economic growth in the long-run. Moreover, despite their importance for external balance, financial inflows may hinder economic activity in both short- and long-run. On the other hand, monetary policy transmission channels through bank credit and capital play a constructive role for GDP growth.

AB  - Purpose This article examines the effects of credit to private sector on the business and trade activities. The effectiveness of rapid expansion in public and private borrowing through state's intervention after COVID-19 pandemic has been assessed in this study. Design/methodology/approach The model to determine the role of credit expansion is based on four equations estimated through panel least square technique on 18 years data of 186 countries. Findings It is concluded that credit to private sector and external debt improve the investment in infrastructure, which is a significant determinant of gross domestic product growth. Empirical evidences corroborate that higher number of firms using banks to finance their investment and the volume of broad money determine the magnitude of credit to private sector. Originality/value This study explores some new evidences and aspects of the credit financing which have not been discussed in this way before.

TI  - Three essays on monetary policy and economic growth in China
AU  - Wang, Peng
AB  - This dissertation consists of three essays that examine various important macroeconomic issues that are of concern to the Chinese economy. The analysis that supports the empirical work is inspired by post-Keynesian theory. The first chapter presents the mechanism of endogenous sterilization by extending the theory of demand-led money supply to the case of China. This view of money is confirmed by the fact that foreign reserves are not cointegrated with base money, meaning that there is no long-run relationship between foreign reserves and the supply of base money, whereas foreign reserves are long-run related with the claims of the central bank and the amount of bonds issued by the central bank.
The second chapter outlines Kaldor's laws and tests for the contributions of the manufacturing sector to labor productivity and overall output growth using the panel dataset of 29 Chinese regions during the period of 1986-2007. Empirical findings, taking advantage of spatial panel econometric techniques, provide significant support for the Kaldorian thesis, while the incorporation of spatial autocorrelation improves the performance of empirical models compared to traditional ones.
The third chapter analyzes the relationship between functional income distribution and Chinese economic growth from 1993 to 2007. Based on a demand-driven macroeconomic framework, there is a possibility of either profit-led or wage-led demand regime depending on the total effects of changes in the profit share on all components of final demand. Our results suggest that the Chinese economy presents a profit-led nature both for all 29 regions and for the coastal regions. We also find that while the expansion of interregional and international trade plays an important role, it is investment expenditure that determines the profit-led pattern of economic growth.

Autoregressive distributed lag (ARDL) approach is employed to determine the long-run relationship. Further, a range of econometric models, such as fully modified least squares method (FMOLS), canonical cointegration regression (CCR) and dynamic ordinary least squares method (DOLS), are applied to check the robustness. The results are stable and robust as all the models yield consistency result. The main findings in this study demonstrate that: (a) interest rate had a negative impact on economic growth in three selected countries. (b) Government spending had a negative impact on economic growth in Malaysia and Singapore, but had a positive impact in Thailand. (c) Monetary policy is more effective in Malaysia and Singapore, while fiscal policy is more effective in Thailand.JEL Classification: E52, E58, E62, C01

AB  - ABSTRACT
This study assesses the effect of monetary policy on economic growth in Nigeria. It used quarterly time series data from 1986Q1 to 2017Q4. SVAR analysis was used to assess the effects of monetary policy following the framework of Inflation Targeting (IT) on economic growth in Nigeria. Findings reveal that monetary policy has a positive shock on economic growth. The monetary policy rate (MPR) positively affects growth. Its effect was however minimal only accounting for a maximum of 3 percent. Also, the broad money supply (M2) had a positive shock but only accounting for a maximum of 7 percent. The study concludes that the inflation targeting (IT) framework is a good monetary policy tool but not sufficient. There is need for other supplementary instruments.

AB  - The main aim of this paper is to investigate the impact of monetary policy tools on economic growth in Azerbaijan during 2005-2018 using the Vector Error Correction Model (VECM). Also, different co-integration methods, namely, Johansen, DOLS, FMOLS and CCR were utilized for the robustness test. The outcomes of the different co-integration methods are consistent with one another and confirm the existence of long-run relationships among variables. Furthermore, the estimation results of VECM show that the monetary base and exchange rate have a positive and statistically significant impact on economic growth in the long-run, while the discount rate is insignificant. The paper concludes that the monetary base and exchange rate should be promoted by policymakers over other monetary policy tools during monetary policy implementation toward stimulating economic growth.

AB  - Monetary policy and Fiscal policy are Macroeconomic instruments used in regulating the financial operations in an economy towards the economic growth. Vast researches have been undertaken and empirical evidences proved that, both policies have to be efficiently and effectively maintained for a sustainable economic growth. The objective of this study is to establish the relationship between the monetary and fiscal policy with economic growth in Nigeria, and determine the suitable percentage mix of the policies. The study uses Money supply, Tax revenue generated and GDP as element of Monetary, Fiscal and Economic Growth respectively, for the period of 10years, from 2006 -2015. Pearson correlation technique was used to establish the relationship between the dependent and independent variables. The analyses revealed that; Money supply made the most significant contribution to prediction of GDP in Nigeria than Tax revenue generated. The results of these findings are however translated to proportion of percentage mix as 87% and 13% for monetary and fiscal policy respectively. Therefore if government increases expenditures, it should also adopt the necessary measures that will necessitate income generation, as well provides governing policies to lower the expense of the income on consumable goods.

T2  - European Journal of Business and Management
AB  - Monetary and fiscal policies have been established by several scholars to have contributed to economic growth of any nation. This paper focused on the identifying policy that contributed effectively to the level of economic growth in Nigeria. Data were collected from the CBN statistical bulletin covering the period of 21years. Unit root test, co integration, VAR model and graph were some of the econometrics techniques used for data estimation. Phillip-perron test statistic revealed that the time series properties of the variables attained stationarity at first order. The variables were co integrated at at most 1 with at least 2 co integrating equations. The individual variable: Minimum Rediscount Rate (LNMRR), Interest Rate (LNIR), Liquidity Rate (LNLR), Cooperate Income Tax (CIT) and Federal budget were not statistically significant to Gross Domestic Product (LNGDP) in the previous and current year. However, interest rate and liquidity rate impacted negatively on the GDP but minimum rediscount rate cooperate income tax and federal budget affect the GDP positively. Monetary and fiscal policies measures are jointly statistically significant to level of economic growth in Nigeria. The reaction of money and fiscal policies measure on the level of economic growth in Nigeria was found to be unstable over the years of study which indicated no long run relationship. However, the study further revealed that fiscal policy measures are more effective in gearing economic growth in Nigeria. The study recommended that there should be effective strategic policies that enhance better fiscal policy implementation in Nigeria that will in the long run contribute to the national economic growth and also more robust and viable monetary policy measures should be made to achieve sound economic growth.

T2  - Journal of Empirical Economics
AB  - This study examined the impact of monetary policy on private capital formation in Nigeria. The central focus of this study was to find out whether monetary policy in Nigeria has brought about significant capital for Private Investment that spurs economic growth. The study made use of secondary data sourced from the Central Bank of Nigeria Statistical Bulletin for the period 1986-2013. The Ordinary Least Square Multiple regression technique was employed alongside the R2 goodness of fit test, F- statistics and the Durbin-Watson tests. The OLS multiple regression obtained result showed that the GDP growth rate has not been attracting significant private investment given the period of study; this implies that the GDP has been growing at a level not sufficient to be able to attract private investment in the economy. Likewise, the money supply and the exchange rate have been relatively stable to also elicit increase in private investment which has in turn and to an extent promote sustainable economic growth in the country through private investment. The domestic credit from financial institutions to the private sector has made its own contribution to growth of Private Investment in the economy. We therefore recommended that to put the Nigerian economy along the path of sustainable growth and development particularly through continous increase in private investment, monetary policy that directs credit to the private sector is expected to be embarked upon so as to encourage private investment.

AB  - This study investigates and measures the long and short run relationship of monetary and fiscal policies on economic growth in Nigeria. A Vector Error Correction (VEC) models technique was employed to analyse and draw policy inferences. Through the VEC model, the relationships then have been investigated by the long-run relationships in the cointegrating vector and the short-run effects from the VEC model. From the cointegration analysis, the long-run relationships give some possible indications of growth in Nigerian economy. We find that the Nigerian economy is determined mostly by money supply. It is clear also from the findings those monetary policy variables: money supply and minimum rediscount rate have dominant long-run effects on the economy. From these results it is clear that monetary policy exacted greater impact on the economic growth but the effects of fiscal policy had lower magnitude more specifically when there is decrease in the inflation rate. Additionally, the 35% speed of adjustment to the short run disequilibrium shows an improvement in the Nigeria economic growth. Although, both monetary and fiscal policy variables may contribute to economic growth in the short and long term, but based on these findings monetary policy will exact more impact if it facilitates the supply side of the economy through money supply.

We explore empirically how country risk, as proxied by sovereign bond spreads, is influenced by U.S. monetary policy, country-specific fundamentals, and conditions in global capital markets. In addition, we simulate the direct effects of a tightening in U.S. monetary policy on economic conditions in developing countries. While country-specific fundamentals are important in explaining fluctuations in country risk, the stance and predictability of U.S. monetary policy are also important for stabilizing capital flows and capital market conditions and fostering economic growth in developing countries.

AB  - For establishing the best monetary policy it is essential to know if in practice monetary variables determine gross domestic product (GDP) in constant prices. Price stability contributes to the formation of stable environment for the development of commercially sustainable activities and expresses the responsibility of central banks for sustainable industrial development. It contributes to maximizing the GDP, employment, stable interest rates and sustainable economic development which have consequences for households' welfare as well as enterprises' value maximization. For a set of more monetary variables, we identified that in Romania money aggregates M2 and M3 as well as internal credit were strongly correlated with GDP over the time period 1995:Q1-2015:Q4, while in Slovakia only M2 and M3 were strongly correlated with GDP in the same time period. Contrary to expectations, according to a Bayesian linear regression, the internal credit changes had a negative impact on economic growth on the overall period. This conclusion is consistent with other empirical studies. This paper's analysis discovered that the aforementioned negative correlation is due to the crisis period, because the regime-switching Bayesian model indicated that only in times of economic contraction changes in internal credit negatively affected economic growth.

The study traced the debate from the Keynesians to the Monetarist. The findings showed that fiscal and monetary policies affected economic growth positively in the sub-region. Moreover, fiscal policy has a greater scale- effect in enhancing economic growth in sub-Saharan Africa. The study concluded that fiscal policy had greater influence on growth than monetary policy. It was recommended, amongst others, that governments of countries in the sub-Saharan region should focus more on
formulating and implementing programmes that support productive investments; foster favourable trade; improve productivity of labour; and make the political environment stable.

T2  - Journal of Macroeconomics
AB  - This paper investigates the economic growth and social welfare implications of monetary policy in an endogenous growth model with endogenous fertility. We show that, in the money-in-the-utility-function framework, endogenous fertility governs the validity of money superneutrality, the transitional dynamics of an anticipated monetary policy, and the optimal monetary policy. Along a balanced growth path, monetary growth increases fertility and reduces the economic growth rate if consumption and real balances are complements or are independent. However, monetary expansion may decrease fertility and increase economic growth if consumption and real balances are substitutes. Generally speaking, the superneutrality of money does not hold in the presence of endogenous fertility. More importantly, with endogenous fertility, the Friedman (1969) rule is no longer a welfare-maximizing monetary policy. We also show that an anticipated inflation induces the transitional dynamics of fertility and the economic growth rate even though the intertemporal elasticity of substitution equals unity. This differs from the conventional notion in the existing literature.

TI  - Impact of Monetary Policy in Nigeria on Inflation, Exchange Rate and Economic Growth
AU  - Hassan, Balami Dahiru
AU  - Fausat, Ahmed Funmilola
AU  - Baba, Yusuf Adamu
AB  - This paper reviewed the framework for monetary policy decisions and the effectiveness of monetary policy implementation in the Nigerian economy by analysing the impact of the policy on inflation, exchange rate and economic growth. The analysis utilized both primary and secondary information. The review revealed that some Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) policies have been under criticism because not all monetary policy tools favour all economic agents. Monetary policy involves trade off because of its implication on the whole economy and each economic agent will react to each monetary policy depending on the degree it negatively or positively affects its business or activity. Policy makers, therefore, may decide to grow the economy during stagflation in the short and medium terms before turning to inflation because of the favourable implications of growth on the economy. For the foreign exchange market, monetary policy makers will have to analyse the fundamentals of export and import as well as the country’s elasticity to export before taking policy on whether to devaluate or not. However, other challenges such as wide gap between the official market (N197.00k) and the black market (N322.00k) which does not favour devaluation within the short run and medium term would require concerted effort. Hence, there is need for policy makers to act in order to reduce round-tripping which is unhealthy to the economy. Also, for effective economic growth and development, it is expedient that monetary policy must be supported by fiscal policy.

TI  - Monetary Policy and Economic Growth Under Money Illusion
AU  - Xie, Danyang
AU  - Miao, Jianjun
AB  - Empirical and experimental evidence documents that money illusion is persistent and widespread. This paper incorporates money illusion into two stochastic continuous-time monetary models of endogenous growth. Motivated by psychology, we model an agent's money illusion behavior by assuming that he maximizes nonstandard utility derived from both nominal and real quantities. Money illusion affects an agent's perception of the growth and riskiness of real wealth and distorts his consumption/savings decisions. It influences long-run growth via this channel. We show that the welfare cost of money illusion is second order, whereas its impact on long-run growth is first order relative to the degree of money illusion. A monetary policy can eliminate this cost by correcting the distortions on a money-illusioned agent's consumption/savings decisions.

T2  - Modern Economy
AB  - It is demonstrated through an Structural Vector Auto Regression (SVAR) model which distinguishes short and long term effects, that the monetary policy implemented in Mexico (1970-2008) has been successful in reducing inflation at the cost of stagnation, especially after 2002. Inflation Targeting is contradictory in itself because, while it is efficient in improving transparency and credibility of the monetary policy, it does not solve the structural causes of inflation and conversely, increases the financial costs of economic agents.

AB  - This paper investigates the role of monetary policy in economic growth. Using an infinitely lived overlapping-generations model with a simple convex technology that can yield endogenous growth, we show that money supply behaviour of the government may have significant effects on the long-run economic growth. In addition to the effect on the long-term growth rate of the economy, the policy may determine whether the economy stays in the exogenous growth process restricted by the growth rate of labour supply, or realizes the endogenous growth that sustains continuous growth of per capita income and consumption.

TI  - The Impact of Monetary Policy on Economic Growth in Bangladesh (1990-2018)
AU  - Sultana, Farjana
AB  - This thesis examines the impact of monetary policy on economic growth in Bangladesh for the period 1990-2018. The main purpose of the study is to find the relationship between monetary policy and economic growth, where money supply, interest rate, inflation, exchange rate remittance inflow, balance of payment has any effect in the GDP growth.  In the model specified, Gross Domestic product (GDP) is dependent variable and money supply, Inflation rate, Interest rate, Exchange rate, Remittance inflow and the Balance of Payment are the independent variable. Here I use ordinary least square technique to evaluate my result by using software package R and use secondary data set. This study finds that broad money supply, interest rate and inflation have positive impact on economic growth. Increase in money supply in this time period positively affects the growth rate with stable inflation now Bangladesh maintain above 6% growth rate. Exchange rate also has positive impact on growth. Bangladesh Bank tries to follow manageable exchange rate system to balance growth. Other hand Bangladesh faces negative balance of payment in long time. It has profound effect on economic growth. Remittance inflow is one of the important parts of our economy, but recent time it decreases and it makes negative impact on GDP. In this situation if we and to maintain sustainable GDP growth we need effective monetary policy to prevent sudden financial shock.

AB  - This study investigates the impact of fiscal and monetary policy on economic growth in (SACU) economies between 1980 and 2017. Panel auto regression distributed lags (PARDLs) estimation technique and Pooled mean group (PMG) estimator were utilised in this study. The results indicate that these policies influence economic growth significantly across SACU economics in the long run. However, fiscal policy is only significant if government expenditure is used as the functional policy instrument rather than government revenue. The short run effects of these macroeconomic policies are mixed. Granger causality results indicate that the direction of cointegration is from government, real interest rate, inflation and official exchange rate to economic growth.

AB  - The role of monetary policy instruments has not been explored by most researchers in Ghana; hence this study investigates the impact of monetary policy instruments on economic growth using time series data from 1990 to 2019. In testing for stationarity, augmented Dickey–Fuller and Phillips–Perron unit root tests were employed; Johansen cointegration and error correction mechanism were used in estimating the long- and short-run dynamic of the variables. The results obtained from the estimation revealed a positive and significant impact of money supply and exchange rate on economic growth for both long and short run. Moreover, monetary policy rate, interest rate, and inflation significantly affected growth rate negatively. The results also indicated a bidirectional causal linkage between money supply and growth rate. There was, however, a unidirectional relationship between interest rate and growth, between inflation and growth, and between monetary policy rate and growth in the long run. The study recommends that monetary policy authorities and the Bank of Ghana (BoG) introduce structural reforms and policies that will help create a favorable climate for both domestic and foreign investment. Again, BoG should keep interest rates, policy rates, and inflation in check to prevent shrinking of economic activities, since these have a direct influence on growth.

We discuss its inflationary consequences, the ability to accelerate economic growth along with created distortions in credit markets. We argue that the long-term macroeconomic stability cannot be sustained under managed exchange rate. We provide counterarguments to views, according to which inflation in Russia has nonmonetary roots and it is possible to increase money supply without causing inflation due to undermonetization of Russian economy and low utilization of production capacities. Negative consequences of monetary easing are illustrated with recent Belorussian experience.

AB  - This paper aims to study the effect of fiscal and monetary policy on economic growth in Nigeria. The major objective of this research work is to examine how monetary policy influences economic growth in Nigeria. In the process of carrying out this research work, various variables such as government total expenditure, government total revenue, inflation, gross domestic product, interest rate, unemployment rate, and broad money supply were adopted. The data used in this research were secondary data obtained from the World Development Indicators (WDI) and Central Bank of Nigeria Statistical Bulletin. Findings were drawn from the research that money supply and government total expenditure and revenue has a significant impact on economic growth in Nigeria. Therefore, recommendation is suggested that to maintain a stable economic growth in Nigeria, the central bank need to inject more money into the economy and the government should use her revenue and expenditure at full optimization. The Autoregressive Distributed Lag Model (ARDL) was adopted as the estimation technique.

T2  - Export-oriented Development Strategies
AB  - The economies of Hong Kong, Singapore, Taiwan, and the Republic of Korea (South Korea), known collectively as Asia’s super exporters, or the gang of four, exhibit three common characteristics: rapid economic growth, spectacular expansion of exports, and substantial increases in the rates of saving and investment over the past two decades (Table 11.1). In all four countries, strong and stable governments set fast economic growth as a high priority (Little 1979, 466; Rabushka 1979, 56). In every case the objective was attained through the promotion of exports (Krueger, Chapter 8 of this book; Kuo 1983, 175-78; Kuo, Ranis, and Fei 1981, 73). However, implementation of this outward-looking growth strategy took a different form in each country. Hong Kong’s relatively laissez-faire approach, for example, contrasts sharply with the degree of government involvement and intervention in Taiwan and South Korea, while Singapore lies somewhere in between.

AU  - Shabbir, Safia
AB  - Using micro data on non-financial listed companies in Pakistan, over the period of 2000-2010, this paper emphasizes over the impact of monetary policy on economic growth through balance sheet channel. At first step, monetary tightening deteriorates the net worth of the firms and leads to cash flow squeeze; of which later affects the economic growth. We find this impact to last for three years over the balance sheets of the firms. Since, industrial sector drives the economic growth; we forecast corporate profitability at the second step. Empirical investigation shows that corporate profitability reverts to its mean at the rate of 25 percent. During Peak, mean reversion is 30 percent while it is 19 percent during trough implying that recession stays relatively longer and economic revival is slow during recessionary phase.

AB  - Is there a link between capital controls and monetary policy autonomy in a country with a floating currency? Shocks to capital flows into a small open economy lead to volatility in asset prices and credit supply. To lessen the impact of capital flows on financial instability, a central bank finds it optimal to use the domestic interest rate to “manage” the capital account. Capital account restrictions affect the behavior of optimal monetary policy following shocks to the foreign interest rate. Capital controls allow optimal monetary policy to focus less on the foreign interest rate and more on domestic variables.

TI  - GLOBAL FINANCIAL INTEGRATION AND CENTRAL BANK POLICIES IN SMALL, OPEN ECONOMIES
AU  - Gudmundsson, Már
T2  - The Singapore Economic Review
AB  - Global financial integration intensified in the period leading up to the Great Financial Crisis, as was witnessed by the growth of cross-border banking, capital flows, and gross external capital positions. For small, open economies (SOEs) that have lifted restrictions on capital movements, global financial integration seems to have undermined the scope for independent monetary policy, even if these countries had adopted a flexible exchange rate regime. Monetary policy transmission was weakened through the interest rate channel, as long-term rates in SOEs became increasingly correlated with long rates in large, advanced countries. The exchange rate channel was unstable, however, with exchange rates diverging from fundamentals as uncovered interest rate parity failed to hold over relevant periods and capital flows were volatile. These tendencies can contribute to monetary and financial instability when they interact badly with other economic and financial risks that can face small, open, and financially integrated economies. This was the case in Iceland. A fundamental rethinking of policy frameworks and tools has been underway in SOEs in the wake of the crisis. Potential policy instruments include foreign exchange intervention, enhanced prudential rules on foreign exchange risks, macroprudential tools, better alignment of fiscal and monetary policy, and even selective capital flow management tools.

TI  - Monetary Policy and Real Stabilization
AU  - Svensson, Lars E.
AB  - Monetary policy can achieve average inflation equal to a given inflation target and, at best, a good
compromise between inflation variability and output-gap variability. Monetary policy cannot completely
stabilize either inflation or the output gap. Increased credibility in the form of inflation expectations anchored
on the inflation target will reduce the variability of inflation and the output gap.
Central banks can improve transparency and accountability by specifying not only an inflation target but also
the dislike of output-gap variability relative to inflation variability.
Central banks can best achieve both the long-run inflation target and the best compromise between inflation
and output-gap stability by engaging in "forecast targeting," where the bank selects the feasible combination
of inflation and output-gap projections that minimize the loss function and the corresponding instrument-rate
plan and sets the instrument-rate accordingly. Forecast targeting implies that the instrument responds to all
information that significantly affects the projections of inflation and the output gap. Therefore it cannot be
expressed in terms of a simple instrument rule, like a Taylor rule.
The objective of financial stability, including a well-functioning payment system, can conveniently be
considered as a restriction on monetary policy that does not bind in normal times, but does bind in times of
financial crises. By producing and publishing Financial Stability Reports with indicators of financial stability,
the central bank can monitor the degree of financial stability and issue warnings to concerned agents and
authorities in due time and this way avoid deteriorating financial stability.
Forecast targeting implies that asset-price developments and potential asset-price bubbles are taken into
account and responded to the extent that they are deemed to affect the projections of the target variables,
inflation and the output gap. In most cases, it will be difficult to make precise judgments, though, especially
to identify bubbles with reasonable certainty.
The zero bound, liquidity traps and risks of deflation are serious concerns for a monetary policy aimed at low
inflation. Forecast targeting with a symmetric positive inflation target keeps the risk of the zero bound,
liquidity traps and deflation small. Prudent central banks may want to prepare in advance contingency plans
for situations when a series of bad shocks substantially increases the risk of falling into a liquidity trap, as
well as contingency plans escaping from a liquidity trap. An open economy, for instance, Japan, can use the
foolproof way of escaping from a liquidity trap, with a price level target, a currency depreciation and a
temporary exchange rate peg, and an exit strategy with a shift to inflation targeting when the price-level target
has been reached.

T2  - Journal of Economic Studies
AB  - Purpose
              The purpose of this paper is to present a theoretical model and empirically verifies the transmission of monetary policy through the credit channel in Brazil. The study verifies if the monetary policy, the economic activity and the maturity of the inflation targeting regime affect the supply of credit.
            
            
              Design/methodology/approach
              The paper offers a review of the literature concerning inflation targeting credibility and the transmission mechanism of monetary policy through the credit channel, it develops a theoretical model based on Bernanke and Blinder and Ferreira and it seeks empirical evidence for the Brazilian economy using ordinary least squares, generalized method of moments and vector autoregressive.
            
            
              Findings
              The estimates indicate that the supply of credit is stimulated when the economy heats up, when the monetary authority reduces the interest rate and when the credibility increases. The evidence also indicate that the supply of credit is affected by the variables of the model, economic activity and employment are affected by monetary policy and the supply of credit exerts influence on both employment and output gap.
            
            
              Research limitations/implications
              An important implication of this study is that, in inflation targeting emerging economies, such as that of Brazil, following a committed monetary policy to price stability which increases the credibility of the regime of inflation targeting and promoting macroeconomic stability represents a good strategy for improving the volume of lending to the private sector, thus stimulating economic activity and employment. What the findings do indicate is that developing credibility is crucial for emerging economies that are trying to grow, but with inflation being kept under control.

              The paper presents the following theoretical and empirical contributions: the model incorporates the effect that the credibility of the inflation targeting regime has on the supply of credit and, the econometric approach provides evidence that the monetary policy, the economic activity and the process of anchoring of inflation expectations affect the supply of credit in Brazil. Moreover, the paper finds evidence that the credit channel acts as a transmission mechanism of monetary policy to the economy.

AB  - Monetary policy is an economic management technique used to bring sustainable economic growth and development in a given economy which has been a pursuit of nations. This has been mainly on how the money affects economic aggregates dates back the time of Adam Smith and later championed by the monetary economists. One of the major objectives of the monetary policy in Nigeria is economic growth using money supply and inflation control (price stability) as a measure; but despite the various monetary regimes that have been adopted by the Central Bank of Nigeria over the years, inflation still remains a major threat to Nigeria’s economic growth. And it is on this premise that we want to analyze the impact of monetary policy on the Nigeria’s economic growth from 1981 to 2021. This study used secondary data sourced from Central Bank of Nigeria Statistical Bulletin (2021) in its analysis. The study employed Autoregressive Distributed Lag (ARDL) bound co-integration to estimate the short run and long run impact of the monetary policy on economic growth in Nigeria which showed a long run relationship. Further estimation result showed that monetary policy impacted on the Nigeria’s economic growth. The study acclaims that central bank should place more emphases on the quality-based nominal anchor (M2) for managing instruments like liquidity ratio, reserve ratio, transaction on treasury bills which directly affect the monetary aggregate. Direct manipulation of interest rates other than the money supply should be a better monetary policy tool to impact on the real variables of the Economy and less emphasis should be placed on the use of interest rate because it had negative but insignificant impact on the economic growth.

TI  - Monetary Policy and Economic Growth in Kenya: The Role of Money Supply and Interest Rates
AU  - Ltd, ICB-InterConsult Bulgaria
T2  - Journal of Applied Economic Sciences (JAES)
AB  - Using the autoregressive distributed lag (ARDL) bounds testing approach; this paper examines the short-run and long- run impact of monetary policy on economic growth in Kenya for the period 1973 to 2013. The paper uses both the broad money supply and the 3- month Treasury bill rate as proxies of monetary policy. Both short-run and long- run empirical results support monetary policy neutrality, implying that monetary policy has no effect on economic growth – both in the short run and in the long run. This could be due to the fact that the increasing fiscal deficits funded domestically in Kenya could have weakened the transmission of monetary policy actions into the real economy. The study recommends that policies aimed at improving the institutional and regulatory environment for the financial sector and monetary policy conduct should be pursued in Kenya. There is also a need for improvement in policy coordination, particularly monetary and fiscal policies.

TI  - The Impact of Monetary Variables on Economic Growth in Iran: A Mone
AU  - Lashkary, Mohammad
AU  - Kashani, Behzad Hassannezhad
AB  - There is a dispute among economists about the impact of monetary variables on real variables. Some believe that the change in money volume affects only the nominal production and it does not have any effect on real variables of economy such as real employment, real production and real economic growth. The others claim that the monetary variables can also influence the real ones in short run and even long run and they escalate the economic growth, as there is monetary misgiving in economic factors. The current research investigates different economic theories in this realm and tests them by applying the existing information and statistics. This is an analytical and empirical research because it analyses events by experimental observations in several statistical models. This paper scrutinizes neutrality or non-neutrality of the money during the period 1959 to 2008 in Iran with a monetarists’ approach. Findings show that there is no significant relationship between the money volume and real economic variables, production and employment and monetary policies are neutral in Iran. The gross domestic product in Iran does not fluctuate intensively except in recent years and it has a normal direction. However, the unemployment rate fluctuates largely which is not natural.

T2  - Global Business and Economics Research
AB  - The study investigated the effects of monetary policy, fiscal policy, and trade policy on economic growth in Ghana using an annual time series data from 1965 to 2013 by employing the Autoregressive Distributed Lag (ARDL) approach to cointegration. The study found a long-run cointegration relationship among monetary policy, fiscal policy, and trade policy and economic growth. The study also found a statistically significant positive effect of monetary policy and fiscal policy on economic growth both in the long-run and in the short-run. In both cases, the long-run effects were more severe than the short-run effects. It is therefore concluded that both monetary and fiscal policies are effective over the study period in achieving high economic growth in Ghana. Comparatively, monetary policy appeared to be more effective than fiscal policy both in the long-run and in the short-run. The study also found insignificant positive and negative effects of trade policy on economic growth both in the long-run and short-run respectively, implying an ineffective trade policy over the study period. Thus, expansion of money supply and a reduction in cash reserve ratio is recommended for an effective monetary policy in achieving high economic growth in Ghana. Also, an increase in government spending geared towards industrialization in Ghana is recommended for an effective fiscal policy. That is, policy makers should focus on both monetary policy and fiscal policy in order to ensure economic growth in the country.

AU  - Chu, Angus C.

AU  - Liao, Chih-Hsing
AB  - How do intellectual property rights that determine the market power of firms influence the effects of monetary policy on economic growth and social welfare? To analyze this question, we develop a monetary R&D-based growth model with elastic labor supply. We find that monetary expansion reduces growth and welfare through a decrease in labor supply that reduces R&D. Furthermore, a larger market power of firms strengthens these effects of monetary policy in the R&D model. In contrast, increasing the market power of firms dampens the growth and welfare effects of monetary policy in the AK model. Therefore, the market power of firms has drastically different implications on the welfare cost of inflation under the two growth engines (i.e., innovation versus capital accumulation). We also calibrate the two models using data in the US and the Euro Area to quantitatively evaluate and compare the welfare cost of inflation in the two economies. Finally, we simulate transition dynamics of the R&D model in order to compute the complete welfare changes from reducing inflation.

AB  - The present study aims to check the long run relationship between monetary variables and gross domestic product. The study has used the yearly data for the periods of 30 years from 1983 to 2013. It is concluded that GDP is positively associated with M2, government expenditures, and inflation. While it is negatively related with interest rate, growth becomes possible with low interest rate. Investment opportunities are increased in economy. With currency appreciation, it has positive impact on growth. Domestic products are cheaper that compete in international markets and BOP becomes favorable. Due to increase in government borrowing from SBP for development purposes money supply increases. Money supply firstly effects the growth, and then it shows the impact on inflation. Due to the increase in the demand of goods output increases and it generates more employment opportunities. Lower interest rate encourages the investor to invest with the result employment increases. These monetary policies increase output growth through money supply which has short run effect. Most of the developing countries lag behind in attaining the objectives and goals of monetary policy. The main hurdles are to increase internal government borrowing and inflation pressure which destabilize the entire economy.

AU  - Mbutor, Mbutor O
AB  - Remittances are a vital component of liquidity flows in Nigeria. This paper evaluates the role of monetary policy in enhancing remittances for economic growth. The vector autoregressive methodology is applied with two stage deductions. The monetary policy rate first impacts intervening variables- exchange rate, interest rate, inflation etc- which in turn impact remittance flows. The data set are tested for temporal properties, including unit roots and co-integration. Preliminary evidence shows that domestic economic prosperity increases remittances to Nigeria; while exchange rate depreciation depresses remittances. The latter outcome reflects remitters’ perception that a stronger Naira is a sign of things-getting-better-back-home.

Data was taken from the sources of national account of World Bank from the year 1965 to 2020 for this purpose. Augmented Dickey- Fuller unit root test was performedto avoid spurious regression. Johansen co-integration test was applied after conforming all variables were integrated in order I (1) then Vector Error Correction model was used to find out the speed of adjustment towards long run equilibrium. The coefficient of VECM was negative and significant that shows long run relationship between monetary policy and GDP Growth. Granger Causality results show two-way causality between money supply andGDP Growth. The result supports the impact of monetary policy on economic growth of the country. It can reduce unemployment, promote investments and stabilize the economy so monetary authorities and policy makers should focus on healthy monetary policy for economic growth of the country.

Secondary data for the period of 1985-2015 were utilized. The data were extracted from the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) Statistical Bulletin and the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS). The linear regression with the application of Ordinary least Squares (OLS) technique was employed to estimate the parameters of the model numerically. Finding revealed that broad money supply had a positive and significant effect on economic growth in Nigeria during post structural adjustment programmer from 1986-2015. Interest rate had a negative and significant effect on economic growth in Nigeria during the same period and inflation rate had a positive and insignificant effect on economic growth in Nigeria at the same time. The study recommended that Central Bank of Nigeria should facilitate the emergence of market based interest rate that would attract both domestic and foreign investments, as well as create jobs, and promote non-oil export, while reviving industries that are currently operational, far below installed capacity. In order to strengthen the financial sector, the Central Bank has to encourage the introduction of more financial instruments that are flexible enough to meet the risk preferences and sophistication of operators in the financial sector.

TI  - ANALYSIS OF THE RELATIVE IMPACT OF MONETARY AND FISCAL POLICIES ON ECONOMIC GROWTH IN ETHIOPIA, USING ARDL APPROACH TO CO-INTEGRATION: WHICH POLICY IS MORE POTENT?
AU  - Tadesse, Tekilu
AU  - Melaku, Tesfaye
T2  - Copernican Journal of Finance & Accounting
AB  - Empirical investigation on the comparative potency of monetary and fiscal policies is still dubious among two major schools of thought in economics so called classical and Keynesian. Hence, this paper investigates the relative effectiveness of monetary and fiscal policies in affecting economic growth by employing Auto-Regressive Distributive Lag Model (ARDL) for the time spanning from 1975 to 2017. The proxies used in this study for monetary and fiscal policy were Broad money supply (M2) and government consumption expenditure respectively while real GDP at constant prices in 2010 is used as proxy for economic growth in Ethiopia. Anderson and Jordan (1968) “St. Louis equation’’ has been used to estimate the comparative potency of monetary and fiscal policies. The empirical results indicate that both the monetary and fiscal policies have equal statistically significant and positive impact on economic growth in Ethiopia with different significance level and magnitude. Besides of equal effectiveness, the elasticity of real output with respect to fiscal policy variable is greater than the elasticity with respect to money supply which show fiscal policy is more effective than monetary policy in influencing Real GDP in the long-run. However, in the short run, the fiscal policy is effective while that of the monetary policy proxy by money supply is ineffective in affecting output growth in Ethiopia. Therefore, to have continuous and sustainable economic growth, the coordination of monetary and fiscal policies are vital and the lack of this coordination leads to a sharp downturn of overall economic performance, even can hurt the economy.

AB  - This paper examined whether monetary policy is acyclical, procyclical or countercyclical and the implications of the interaction of such cyclicality with industrial output on real economic growth in Nigeria. After determining the time series properties of the variables and based on conventional cyclicality measures, the fully modified ordinary least square method was used to examine the impact of monetary policy cyclicality and industry output on economic growth. Granger Causality test was used to examine the causal relationship between the monetary cyclicality and output growth. The results showed that monetary policy is countercyclical on economic growth in Nigeria. Monetary policy cyclicality had significant impact on economic growth and the causality test also indicated that monetary policy has a direct effect and indirect effect through industrial output growth on real economic growth in Nigeria. The findings are consistent with similar studies in other countries, and the policy implication of the results is that despite the recent doubt, monetary policy is still a potent stabilization policy that can be used to stimulate industrial-output growth and counter the recent downturn in real economic activities in Nigeria.

The result shows a significant negative effect of inflation in the short term, and other variables are insignificant. Inflation and exchange rate have a significant positive impact in the long term, and money supply has a negative coefficient. Besides, interest rates do not significantly affect Indonesia's economic growth. Findings of the negative long-term impact of the money supply on growth are not a good indication; we argue that this anomaly needs to be taken seriously by the authorities to maintain economic stability and sustainable growth.

AB  - This study examines the impact of fiscal, monetary and trade policies on Nigerian economic growth from 1985 to 2020. This study adopts endogenous growth model (AK model) as its theoretical framework. The unit root test results reveal that there is mixed level of stationarity in the variables. The bound test result shows that the variables cointegrate. The ARDL long-run result shows that fiscal policies stimulate economic growth, while on the contrary, trade policies deter Nigerian economic growth. The short-run result shows that the fiscal policies has an inconsistent impact on Nigerian economic growth and thus differs from the long-run result; while government spending continues to drive economic growth in Nigeria, government revenues have no effect on the growth of the economy. The result of the impact of monetary policies shows that interest rate impels growth of the economy while money supply deters growth of Nigeria’s economy; lastly, the trade policies maintain her negative influence on the economy in both the long run and short run. Sequel to the findings, the study recommends the following: Policymakers should place more emphasis on using fiscal policy which was found to be stimulating the country's growth rate. Whenever it is expedient to use monetary policy to stimulate economic growth, policy makers should make use of interest rates as it stimulates the growth of the economy in the short run. The government should review her trade policies to reduce import by encouraging consumption of local products and motivate exporters of goods (raw material) to refine the products before exporting such.

AB  - This study introduces some aspects regarding the link between monetary policy and economic growth, through a rule well known in the literature which is named Taylor’s rule and through the concept of sacrifice ratio which encompasses the impact of the cost of disinflation on the economic growth of a country. In this paper, we rely on estimates of the growth of potential GDP of the National Bank of Romania for the period 2003-2006 while for the period 2007-2012 we rely on the estimates reported by the International Monetary Fund. Thus, we carry a deterministic exercise for computing the interest rate on the period 2003-2012 as depicted from the Taylor’s rule and we compare it with the effective monetary policy interest rate used by the National Bank of Romania. In the same time, we calculate the sacrifice ratio for the period 1997-2013 so as to be able to form an opinion regarding the cost of disinflation and its comparison with the typical estimates for larger time spans and for other countries.

AB  - This paper examined the impact of monetary policy on economic growth in Nigeria. The Vector Auto-regression Technique (VAR) was used to analyse data between 1980-2017. The result of this paper shows that monetary policy represented by money supply (M2) has a positive impact on economic growth proxy with RGDP. Monetary policy variables-interest rate, money supply, exchange rate and liquidity ratio all had a negative and non significant relationship with inflation. This paper however recommends that the gap between monetary policy formulation and implementation should be bridged so as to ensure the attainment of the set goals, there should be coordination between fiscal and monetary policy measures and that the formal and informal credit sector of the economy so as to prevent counter effect to the monetary policy.

AB  - AbstractThis article examines the role of monetary policy and trade openness to raise income in India for the monetary-targeting regime and the multiple-indicator approach regime of monetary policy. The impact of the key instruments of monetary policy, namely, money supply, interest rate and exchange rate, with trade openness on income, is assessed. Besides, how interest rate responds to monetary instruments, income and trade openness is studied. Empirical analysis finds a significant positive impact of the broad money supply, both in the short run and the long run, along with a negative long-run impact of the real interest rate and a positive impact of the real effective exchange rate in the variations of income. On the other hand, trade openness contributes to a rise in income in the short run, while its impact on the long run is negative. The interest rate has also responded to policy instruments, income and openness which indicates that the monetary policy is effective over the two monetary regimes.

AB  - We quantify the macroeconomic effects of the European Central Bank's unconventional monetary policies using a dynamic stochastic general equilibrium model which includes a set of shadow interest rates. Extracted from the yield curve, these shadow rates provide unconstrained measures of the overall stance of monetary policy. Counterfactual analyses show that, without unconventional measures, the euro area would have suffered (i) a substantial loss of output since the Great Recession and (ii) a period of deflation from mid-2015 to early 2017. Specifically, year-on-year inflation and GDP growth would have been on average about 0.61% and 1.09% below their actual levels over the period 2014Q1–17Q2, respectively.

TI  - Financial globalisation and monetary policy effectiveness
AU  - Georgiadis, Georgios

T2  - Journal of International Economics
AB  - In theory financial globalisation has an ambiguous effect on monetary policy effectiveness. On the one hand, exposure to global financial cycles dampens the output effect of a tightening in monetary policy in financially integrated economies and thereby reduces monetary policy effectiveness. On the other hand, another salient feature of financial globalisation is that economies have become increasingly net long in foreign currency, which amplifies monetary policy effectiveness: economies experience larger valuation losses and wealth effects on their external balance sheets in response to an exchange rate appreciation when monetary policy is tightened, hence triggering stronger output effects. We quantify empirically the net impact of financial globalisation on monetary policy effectiveness through these two opposing channels. We find that since the 1990s the second channel has dominated so that financial globalisation has amplified monetary policy effectiveness in the typical advanced and emerging market economy. By our estimates, the output effect of a tightening in monetary policy has increased by 25% due to financial globalisation. Our results imply that financial globalisation has modified the transmission of monetary policy by strengthening the importance of the exchange rate channel.

TI  - Fiscal limits and monetary policy: default vs. inflation

T2  - Economic Modelling
T3  - Special Issue on Current Challenges on Macroeconomic Analysis and International Finance Modelling
AB  - This paper studies the monetary policy trade-off between low inflation and low sovereign risk in the environment where fiscal authorities fail to fully ensure the sustainability of government debt. Building on the Fiscal Theory of Price Level (FTPL) and the Fiscal Theory of Sovereign Risk (FTSR), this paper differs in its baseline assumption about the monetary policy objective, which is neither to rule out defaults regardless of inflation costs (as in FTPL), nor to follow inflation targeting regardless of associated sovereign risk (as in FTSR). Instead, we study the case in which the central bank controls the risky interest rate to minimize the probability of default while ruling out large inflation hikes. We show that this policy regime can mitigate default risks only when the central bank is expected to allow sufficient increases in inflation. When agents believe that the central bank's tolerance toward inflation hikes has increased, equilibrium risk premium goes down, suggesting that information concerning changes in the central bank's preferences over inflation directly impacts default risks.

TI  - Fiscal policy and economic growth in South Africa
AU  - Kofi Ocran, Matthew
T2  - Journal of Economic Studies
AB  - Purpose – This paper aims to examine the effects of fiscal policy associated with increases in government expenditures, tax revenue and budget deficit on the South African economy. Design/methodology/approach – Structural VARs based on the Blanchard‐Quard decomposition identification scheme were used in the empirical analysis. With the aid of quarterly data covering the period 1990:1 to 2008:4, the identified true models are used to estimate various impulse‐response functions. The impulse‐response functions represent the responses of real output and interest rates to shocks from tax revenue, budget deficit and government consumption and investment expenditures. Findings – The results suggest that the fiscal policy instruments have varied effects on output and interest rates. The effect of the fiscal policy on output appears to be quite modest but persistent; however, the response from interest rate is temporary and substantial most cases. Originality/value – The debate on the efficacy of fiscal policy in stimulating growth seems to have assumed new prominence in the wake of the recent global financial crisis. This paper contributes to the discourse from a South African focused empirical effort. Other fiscal policy authorities may find the paper valuable.

TI  - Monetary policy in developing countries: lessons from Kenya
AU  - Gerrard, Christopher
AU  - Lucas, Robert
AU  - Porter, Tom
T2  - The Journal of International Trade & Economic Development
AB  - We estimate and then simulate a model of Kenyan economic development from 1965 to 1997 with two objectives in mind. The first is to demonstrate the degree of volatility of cyclical shocks that developing countries experience and to calculate the domestic nominal adjustments required by these shocks under both irrevocably fixed and free exchange rates.A comparison of these counterfactual nominal adjustments identifies the short-run implications for an economy of the choice of exchange rate regime. The second objective is to provide an estimate of the consequences for the economic development of Kenya of the lack of a coherent monetary order (excessive domestic credit expansion and overvalued exchange rate) throughout most of the period since 1965.A neoclassical convergence growth model based on Barro and Sala-i-Martin (1992) is employed and calibrated to represent the long-run growth path of real GDP in Kenya. A short-run four-sector CGE model is constructed that allows for cyclical movements of real GDP about the convergence growth path. The cyclical model focuses on the adjustment of the relative price of non-traded goods that is required to ensure short-run equilibrium in the non-traded goods sector. Given that terms of trade shocks dominated the macro environment of Kenya over the sample period, we find that a free exchange rate regime would have insulated the economy to a greater degree than an irrevocably fixed regime. In the growth decomposition exercise, we estimate that the two largest (and negative) influences on Kenyan economic growth were the decline in the external terms of trade from 100 in 1965 to an average of 79.5 over the 32-year time period, and the overvalued Kenyan shilling represented by a premium on the parallel market for foreign exchange. Overall, we estimate that the overvalued exchange rate reduced economic growth by an average of 0.47 per cent per annum over the 32 years.

T2  - European Economic Review
AB  - A question at the center of many analyses of optimal monetary policy is, why do central banks never implement the Friedman rule? To the list of answers to this question, we add neoclassical production (specifically, the Tobin effect) as one possible explanation. To that end, we study an overlapping generations economy with capital where limited communication and stochastic relocation create an endogenous transactions role for fiat money. We assume a production function with a knowledge externality (Romer style) that nests economies with endogenous growth (AK form) and those with no long-run growth (the Diamond model). The Tobin effect is shown to be always operative. Under CRRA preferences, a mild degree of social increasing returns is sufficient (but not necessary) for some positive inflation to dominate zero inflation and for the Friedman rule to be sub-optimal, irrespective of the degree of risk aversion.

It starts with a discussion of the science and practice of monetary policy before the crisis and then uses the lessons from the crisis to argue how the practice of monetary policy should be rethought along six dimensions: flexible inflation targeting, response to asset price bubbles, dichotomy between monetary policy and financial stability policy, risk management and gradualism, fiscal dominance, and forward guidance.

TI  - The effectiveness of monetary policy in China: Evidence from a Qual VAR
AU  - Chen, Hongyi
AU  - Chow, Kenneth
AU  - Tillmann, Peter
T2  - China Economic Review
AB  - Analyzing monetary policy in China is not straightforward because the People's Bank of China (PBoC) implements policy by using more than one instrument. In this paper we use a Qual VAR, a conventional VAR system augmented with binary policy announcements, to extract a latent indicator of tightening and easing pressure, respectively, for China. The model acknowledges that policy announcements are endogenous and summarizes policy by a single indicator. The Qual VAR allows us to study the impact of monetary policy in terms of unexpected changes in these latent variables, which we identify using sign restrictions. We show that the transmission of monetary policy impulses to the rest of the economy is similar to the transmission process in advanced economies in terms of both output growth and inflation despite a very different monetary policy framework. We find that bank loans are not sensitive to policy changes, which implies that window guidance is still a necessary policy tool. We also find that the impact of monetary policy shocks is asymmetric in terms of asset prices, that is, the asset price reactions differ in their sensitivity to tightening shocks and easing shocks, respectively. In particular, an easing of monetary conditions boosts stock prices while a tightening shock leaves stock prices unaffected. This shows that monetary policy is not a suitable tool to stabilize asset prices, which raises implications for financial stability and macroprudential policy.
