This article investigates how US market participants adjust yield curve expectations in response to two shocks related to monetary policy. The results show that in the aggregate, market participants initially underreact to changes in monetary policy. This implies that news are not fully absorbed, which potentially impedes a smooth monetary policy transmission. We further show that these information rigidities could be driven by a lack of information diffusion among individual forecasters. Last, we find that depending on the source of the shock and the maturities of the yields, underreaction is followed by a period of overcompensation a pattern called delayed overshooting. Knowing this allows the central bank to better calibrate their actions in the first place, which could pave the way for more optimal monetary policy.","2021-11-01","2023-03-30 17:26:53","2023-03-30 17:26:53","2023-03-30 17:26:53","887-901","","","191","","Journal of Economic Behavior & Organization","","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","C:\Users\Enzinger\Zotero\storage\ZPK8F887\Boeck und Feldkircher - 2021 - The Impact of Monetary Policy on Yield Curve Expec.pdf; C:\Users\Enzinger\Zotero\storage\D99IN29Q\S0167268121004297.html","","","Belief bias; Expectation formation; Monetary policy","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Deterministic and stochastic simulations of a macroeconometric model are used to study spillovers, adjustment and stabilization in EMS economies. They show that there exists a significant trade-off between the two regimes in terms of output and price deviations from target. While Germany enjoys more stability under the asymmetric regime, the other EMS economies are stabilized more effectively by a symmetric target. The resulting tension must have been at least partly responsible for the recent EMS crises.","1996-02-01","2023-03-30 17:27:14","2023-03-30 17:27:14","2023-03-30 17:27:14","95-116","","1","15","","Journal of International Money and Finance","Monetary policy targets and the stabilization objective","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","C:\Users\Enzinger\Zotero\storage\QAWQECKM\026156069500047X.html","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The passive-money view treats the money supply as an endogenous variable that plays no role in that mechanism. In contrast the active-money view, while recognizing money's endogeneity, nevertheless treats it as having causative significance for the behaviour of output and inflation. It is argued that the active view is more plausible, on both theoretical and empirical grounds. It is further suggested that, notwithstanding the effects of institutional change in the Canadian financial system on the stability of relationships involving the quantity of money, the active view implies the desirability of the Bank of Canada's paying more systematic attention than it now does to the behaviour of monetary aggregates, particularly narrow ones, in the design and implementation of monetary policy.","1999-04-03","2023-03-30 17:27:25","2023-03-30 17:27:50","2023-03-30 17:27:25","","","","","","","","","","","","","","en-US","","","","","","","Number: 1999-5 Publisher: Bank of Canada DOI: 10.34989/swp-1999-5","","C:\Users\Enzinger\Zotero\storage\XG7TV7B2\Laidler - 1999 - The Quantity of Money and Monetary Policy.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

They examine the costs and benefits of adding flexibility to the Bank's current inflation-targeting framework, and conclude that maintaining low and stable consumer price inflation is the best contribution that monetary policy can make to promoting economic and financial stability, although some flexibility in the target horizon may allow monetary policy to deal appropriately with asset-price bubbles and other atypical events. The authors suggest that monetary policy may, in principle, be better able to maintain low and stable consumer price inflation by leaning against an asset-price bubble (even though it may mean that inflation deviates longer than usual from its target), when such an event is well identified and likely to have significant real economic effects. This circumstance is likely to be rare in practice, however, because economists are far from being able to determine consistently and reliably when leaning against a particular bubble is likely to be successful. The authors also describe ongoing Bank research to better understand the transmission of asset prices to the real economy and the interaction between asset prices and optimal monetary policy.","2007-07-13","2023-03-30 17:28:46","2023-03-30 17:29:02","2023-03-30 17:28:46","","","","","","","Asset-Price Misalignments and Monetary Policy","","","","","","","en-US","","","","","","","Number: 2007-6 Publisher: Bank of Canada DOI: 10.34989/sdp-2007-6","","C:\Users\Enzinger\Zotero\storage\EB6EKRQM\Selody und Wilkins - 2007 - Asset-Price Misalignments and Monetary Policy How.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Second, using disaggregated data we regress bank lending on the interaction of bank competition and monetary policy shocks.

While a wealth of theoretical literature suggests a stabilising role of monetary policy via aggregate demand channel, there exists hardly any empirical consensus on this issue. Very recently, a limited strand of empirical literature has attempted to shed light in this arena. The present study contributes to this literature by analysing the effectiveness of aggregate demand channel in presence of production cost channel of monetary policy transmission, affecting prices positively via supply side, in a panel of developed and emerging economies for the period 2006 Q1 to 2016 Q2. We find that an unexpected monetary tightening has a positive and significant effect on food inflation in both advanced and emerging economies. Our findings suggest that in the backdrop of inflationary pressure stemming from the food sector, a monetary tightening may turn out to be destabilising for the food as well as overall inflation in the economy.","2020-07-01","2023-03-30 17:29:13","2023-03-30 17:29:13","2023-03-30 17:29:13","122-141","","","89","","Economic Modelling","Can monetary policy stabilise food inflation?","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","C:\Users\Enzinger\Zotero\storage\ZCN5IMIF\S0264999318310265.html","","","Emerging economies; Food inflation; Monetary policy; Panel vector auto-regression","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In all three countries the effect of balance sheet shocks on house prices peaks higher and is more persistent than the response of policy rate shocks. In Sweden and Denmark the impact is more sluggish in case of balance sheet shocks while in Norway the speed of the reaction is similar in case of both types of monetary policy shock.","2019-12-01","2023-03-30 17:29:17","2023-03-30 17:29:17","2023-03-30 17:29:17","101659","","","46","","Journal of Housing Economics","","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","C:\Users\Enzinger\Zotero\storage\JT2SCRPT\S1051137718301438.html","","","House prices; SVAR; Unconventional monetary policy; Zero and sign restrictions","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
