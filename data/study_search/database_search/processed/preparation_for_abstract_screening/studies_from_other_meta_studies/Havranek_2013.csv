First, the maximal effect on bilateral real exchange rates is observed on impact, so that the “delayed overshooting” puzzle disappears. Second, after a contractionary shock prices fall at all horizons, so that the price puzzle is not there.

We document a well-functioning transmission mechanism similar to the euro area countries, especially in terms of persistence of monetary policy shocks. Subject to various sensitivity tests, we find that a contractionary monetary policy shock has a negative effect on the degree of economic activity and the price level, both with a peak response after one year or so. Regarding prices at the sectoral level, tradables adjust faster than non-tradables, which is in line with microeconomic evidence on price stickiness. There is no price puzzle, as our data come from a single monetary policy regime. There is a rationale in using the real-time output gap instead of current GDP growth, as using the former results in much more precise estimates. The results indicate a rather persistent appreciation of the domestic currency after a monetary tightening, with a gradual depreciation afterwards.","2009-11-01","2023-03-28 10:02:56","2023-03-28 10:02:56","2023-03-16 09:27:31","419-443","","4","36","","Empirica","The effects of monetary policy in the Czech Republic","","","","","","","en","","","","","Springer Link","","","","","https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007%2Fs10663-009-9102-y.pdf","E31; E52; E58; Monetary policy transmission; Real-time data; Sectoral prices; VAR","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Monetary policy is identified within a nonlinear, structural VAR framework with a regime-switching policy block that allows for contemporaneous policy reactions in a small open economy. The key finding is that monetary policy in Canada has undergone important changes in monetary policy regimes since the early 1970s that correspond to changes in operating procedures and medium-term inflation targets. Overall, the Bank of Canada is found to use a “hybrid” operating procedure in different monetary policy regimes, where it sets a monetary policy rate, while “leaning against the wind” to smooth exchange-rate fluctuations and to offset unexpected increases in long-term yields in order to maintain monetary conditions. Although the magnitude of the contemporaneous monetary policy responses are regime-dependent, the transmission of the responses through financial markets are regime independent. The study also constructs regime-switching measures of the overall level and relative volatility of monetary conditions that captures both the endogenous and exogenous components of the monetary policy response function.","2010-09-01","2023-03-28 10:02:56","2023-03-28 10:02:56","2023-03-16 09:28:23","782-796","","3","32","","Journal of Macroeconomics","","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","; ","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0164070410000042/pdfft?md5=ad439dd1a2d7e4827e991b0a246dcef2&pid=1-s2.0-S0164070410000042-main.pdf&isDTMRedir=Y; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0164070410000042?casa_token=d48sPNISAIgAAAAA:PqF4Qbjrup5CRPlI7ybDHSzAd33jZ8hqiGFNRHWyhaMsSL3KSYDZQ4y4E_Njf8TK8hzJ46rAw_8","Monetary policy; Regime-switching; Small open economy; Structural VAR","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We also always reject the orthogonality conditions between policy shocks and macroeconomic variables. We show that using invalid restrictions often produces misleading policy measures and dynamic responses. These results have important implications for the measurement of policy shocks and their temporal effects as well as for the estimation of the monetary authority's reaction function.","2004-09-01","2023-03-28 10:02:58","2023-03-28 10:02:58","2023-03-16 09:38:14","1217-1243","","6","51","","Journal of Monetary Economics","Monetary policy shocks","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304393204000698/pdfft?md5=093fafbc54e13dacff0d79cc6c165081&pid=1-s2.0-S0304393204000698-main.pdf&isDTMRedir=Y","Conditional heteroscedasticity; Monetary policy indicators; Orthogonality conditions","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We will take into account three channels - the interest rate, the exchange rate and the domestic credit - whose relative importance will be accounted for using a structural VAR model. The results show that all the countries share a weak domestic credit channel while they are highly heterogeneous with regards to the relative effectiveness of the interest rate and exchange rate channels. Thus, Hungary and Poland's distinctive feature is the presence of a price puzzle effect combined with a high influence of the exchange rate which acts both as a mechanism of monetary policy transmission and as a supply and demand shock absorber. On the contrary, just like in the case of the Euro zone countries, it is the interest rate channel that has the major influence in the case of the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Slovenia and partially Romania. Therefore, this latter group appears to be more apt to join the EMU in the near future, which can be confirmed by the Slovenian case.","2009","2023-03-28 10:02:58","2023-03-28 10:02:58","2023-03-16 09:39:23","","","2","9","","","The Monetary Transmission Mechanisms in the CEECs","","","","","","","en","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Evidence based on vector autoregressions","Journal of Applied Econometrics","","1099-1255","10.1002/jae.832","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/jae.832","This paper uses a simple VAR for the USA and Euro area to analyse the underlying shocks of the early millennium slowdown, i.e. supply, demand, monetary policy and oil price shocks. The results of two identification strategies are compared. One is based on traditional zero restrictions and, as an alternative, an identification scheme based on more recent sign restrictions is proposed. The main conclusion is that the recent slowdown is caused by a combination of several shocks: negative aggregate supply and aggregate spending shocks, the increase of oil prices in 1999, and restrictive monetary policy in 2000. These shocks are more pronounced in the USA than the Euro area. The results are somewhat different depending on the identification strategy. It is illustrated that traditional zero restrictions can have an influence on the estimated impact of certain shocks.

The results show that the monetary-policy and the aggregate-supply shocks are important determinants of the nominal term structure. Moreover, the monetary-policy innovations have a large but transitory effect on the nominal bond yields, primarily by changing the slope of the yield curve, and the aggregate-supply shocks from private sector have a more persistent effect on the level of the yield curve, but have little effect on the slope of the yield curve.","2003-05-20","2023-03-28 10:02:58","2023-03-28 10:02:58","2023-03-16 09:43:30","901-906","","8","35","","","Stylized facts on nominal term structure and business cycles","","","","","","","","","","","","Taylor and Francis+NEJM","","","","","https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/0003684022000018204","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
