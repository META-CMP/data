It finds that external exogenous factors prolong the impact of monetary policy transmission on GDP growth and inflation in India, while removing the problem of ‘price puzzle’. Among the various channels of transmission, interest rate channel, credit channel and asset prices channel are found to be important, while exchange rate channel is weak. A positive shock to policy rate leads to slowdown in credit growth with a lag of two quarters and subsequently impacts GDP growth and inflation negatively. The same monetary policy shock has a negative impact on asset prices from the third quarter onwards and, in turn, has a pronounced negative impact on GDP growth and inflation. Exchange rate channel is found to have an insignificant impact on GDP growth, but has non-negligible impact on inflation. Interest rate channel is found to account for about half of the total impact of monetary shocks on GDP growth and about one-third of the total impact on inflation, indicating that interest rate channel is the most important channel for monetary policy transmission in India.","2012-06","2023-03-14 16:14:26","2023-03-14 16:14:26","2023-03-14 16:14:26","","","","","","","Monetary Policy Transmission in India","","","","","University Library of Munich, Germany","","","","MPRA Paper","","","RePEc - Econpapers","","","","C:\Users\Enzinger\Zotero\storage\RPAQZZ2V\Khundrakpam und Jain - 2012 - Monetary Policy Transmission in India A Peep Insi.pdf; C:\Users\Enzinger\Zotero\storage\AM7632NI\Khundrakpam und Jain - 2012 - Monetary Policy Transmission in India A Peep Insi.pdf; C:\Users\Enzinger\Zotero\storage\8X6LNT2K\50903.html","","","Interest Rate Channel; Monetary Policy; Monetary Transmission; Structural VAR","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Additional support for this view resides in a number of earlier studies that have found that the impact of interest rates on the real economy has been miniscule. However, taking into account numerous reforms in the financial sector and more widely in the Chinese economy, interest rates may have gained some influence in the last few years. It is important to study the effectiveness of interest rates also in light of future reforms of the monetary policy tools in China. Whereas administrative policy measures were effective in guiding the behaviour of state-owned enterprises, the authorities may need to increase the use of more market-oriented monetary policy tools as the share of the economy in private and foreign ownership grows. We use a vector error correction model to study, within a credit demand framework, whether the impact of interest rates in China has become stronger over the last decade.

However, the assumption that this theorem holds is questionable. This paper argues that there are frictions in the market which traditional models based on the Modigliani and Miller theorem fail to take into account in explaining how monetary policy and other shocks are transmitted to the economy and points to new directions. A comprehensive macroeconomic model should incorporate financial market interactions to enhance the understanding of the transmission mechanisms of monetary policy and other shocks. If market dynamics are not taken into account, macroeconomic models used by policymakers may point to wrong policy choices. Motivated by the lack of assessment of the recently launched financial reforms, deregulation, consolidations, financial innovations and joint payment systems, the paper assesses the process of monetary transmission mechanism by investigating evidence of a bank lending channel in SADC during the period 1990–2006 using data from the banking sector. Data from a panel of banks is used to identify shifts in the loan supply curve in response to changes in monetary policy using a vector autoregression (VAR) model. Although the results are mixed the paper generally reports the existence of a bank-lending channel in all SADC countries in the sample.

Using innovation accounting in a structural vector autoregressive model, it is established that monetary authorities in Malawi employ hybrid operating procedures and pursue both price stability and high growth and employment objectives. Two operating targets of monetary policy are identified, viz., bank rate and reserve money, and it is demonstrated that the former is a more effective measure of monetary policy than the latter. The study also illustrates that bank lending, exchange rates and aggregate money supply contain important additional information in the transmission process of monetary policy shocks in Malawi. Furthermore, it is shown that the floatation of the Malawi Kwacha in February 1994 had considerable effects on the country's monetary transmission process. In the post-1994 period, the role of exchange rates became more conspicuous than before although its impact was weakened, and the importance of aggregate money supply and bank lending in transmitting monetary policy impulses was enhanced. Overall, the monetary transmission process evolved from a weak, blurred process to a somewhat strong, less ambiguous mechanism.","2011","2023-03-14 16:40:12","2023-03-14 16:40:12","2023-03-14 16:40:12","224-250","","3","79","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Wiley Online Library","","_eprint: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/j.1813-6982.2011.01284.x","","C:\Users\Enzinger\Zotero\storage\ZQ4DV439\Ngalawa und Viegi - 2011 - Dynamic Effects of Monetary Policy Shocks in Malaw.pdf","","","E52; E58; Monetary policy; monetary transmission; structural VARs","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Our paper addresses this highly topical issue of macro-prudential framework with the focus on effectiveness of monetary policy in affecting some financial stability indicators, in the experience of several Central and Eastern European countries during 2003M01–2012M06. Using a Structural Vector Autoregressive model and impulse response function, we analyze the impact of short-term interest rates upon industrial production, loan to deposit ratio for the banking system, stock prices and exchange rate (proxy variables for financial stability). We want to test if the interest rate is conducive to financial stability. Our empirical results show that the effectiveness of the short-term interest rate in affecting selected asset prices depends on monetary policy strategy. In the case of the Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland and Romania, the interest rate instrument used for inflation targeting is conducive to financial stability. Among countries with a fixed exchange rate regime, only in Bulgaria does transmission of the foreign interest rate impulse to domestic variables promote financial stability. Additionally, our results show that in Latvia and Lithuania adjustments to the monetary policy of the European Central Bank (ECB) are not in accordance with country-specific conditions.

The overall impact on aggregate demand is then decomposed to observe the differential impact among the various components. It finds that an interest rate hike has a significant negative impact on the growth of aggregate demand. However, the maximum impact is borne by investment demand growth and imports growth. Impact on private consumption growth and exports growth are relatively far more subdued, while there is hardly any cumulative impact on government consumption growth as it increases after some marginal fall initially. Variance decomposition analysis indicates that interest rate accounts for a significant percentage of the fluctuation in the growth of all the components of aggregate demand, except government consumption. Further, interest rate channel completely dominates exchange rate channel in monetary transmission, though the latter channel has non-negligible impact on investment and imports.","2012-12","2023-03-14 16:46:51","2023-03-14 16:46:51","2023-03-14 16:46:51","","","","","","","","","","","","","","en","","MPRA Paper","","","","","Pages: 1-20 Volume: 2012","","C:\Users\Enzinger\Zotero\storage\KCA28ZDS\Khundrakpam - 2012 - Estimating Impacts of Monetary Policy on Aggregate.pdf; C:\Users\Enzinger\Zotero\storage\JEU6GPWR\50902.html","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We will take into account three channels – the interest rate, the exchange rate and the domestic credit – whose relative importance will be accounted for using a structural VAR model. The results show that all the countries share a weak domestic credit channel while they are highly heterogeneous with regards to the relative effectiveness of the interest rate and exchange rate channels. Thus, Hungary and Poland’s distinctive feature is the presence of a price puzzle effect combined with a high influence of the exchange rate which acts both as a mechanism of monetary policy transmission and as a supply and demand shock absorber. On the contrary, just like in the case of the Euro zone countries, it is the interest rate channel that has the major influence in the case of the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Slovenia and partially Romania.

Second, there is no evidence of price and exchange rate puzzles. Third, the source of Chilean output, price level, and real exchange rate volatility is similar to that identified in industrial countries: monetary policy explains a relatively small proportion of output, price level, and exchange rate variability.

Empirical testing demonstrates that the seven-day Repo rate has an insignificant influence on both GDP changes and on the price level changes. Furthermore, the relationships between monetary aggregate (M2) and short-run money market interest rates suggest that the short-run interest rates do not have significant influence on the monetary aggregate. Therefore, we have determined that short-run money market interest rates are ineffective as a monetary policy-operating objective.","2010","2023-03-14 16:47:16","2023-03-14 16:47:16","2023-03-14 16:47:16","","","","","","","The Effects of Short-Term Interest Rates on Output, Price and Exchange Rates","","","","","","Rochester, NY","en","","SSRN Scholarly Paper","","","Social Science Research Network","","","","C:\Users\Enzinger\Zotero\storage\4C35HHPQ\Sun et al. - 2010 - The Effects of Short-Term Interest Rates on Output.pdf","","","macroeconomic policy; monetary; money","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","1875075","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

"7Z4KVJ9P","report","2005","Vonnák, Balázs","Estimating the effect of Hungarian monetary policy within a structural VAR framework","","","","","https://www.econstor.eu/handle/10419/83585","A standard approach in measuring the effect of monetary policy on output and prices is to estimate a VAR model, characterise somehow the monetary policy shock and then plot impulse responses. In this paper I attempt to do this exercise with Hungarian data. I compare two identification approaches. One of them involves the ‘sign restrictions on impulse responses’ strategy applied recently by several authors. I also propose another approach, namely, imposing restrictions on implied shock history. My argument is that in certain cases, especially in the case of the Hungarian economy, the latter identification scheme may be more credible. In order to obtain robust results I use two datasets. To tackle possible structural breaks I make alternative estimates on a shorter sample as well. The main conclusions are the followings: (1) although the two identification approaches produced very similar results, imposing restrictions on history may help to dampen counterintuitive reaction of prices; (2) after 1995 a typical unanticipated monetary policy contraction (a roughly 25 basis points rate hike) resulted in an immediate 1 per cent appreciation of the nominal exchange rate (3) followed by a 0.3% lower output and 0.1-0.15% lower consumer prices; (4) the impact on prices is slower than on output; it reaches its bottom 4-6 years after the shock, resembling the intuitive choreography of sticky-price models; (5) using additional observations prior to 1995 makes identification more difficult indicating the presence of a marked structural break.","2005","2023-03-14 16:47:22","2023-03-14 16:47:22","2023-03-14 16:47:22","","","","","","","","","","","","MNB Working Papers","","eng","http://www.econstor.eu/dspace/Nutzungsbedingungen","Working Paper","","","www.econstor.eu","","ISBN: 9789639383609","","C:\Users\Enzinger\Zotero\storage\8ID4BR6J\Vonnák - 2005 - Estimating the effect of Hungarian monetary policy.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2005/1","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We find that the responsiveness of the CPI index and output in Poland is smaller and slower than in the euro zone. Using panel data we check how bank-specific characteristics affect operation of the lending channel. In contrast to the results for the euro area the degree of liquidity of an average bank seems not to work in a way predicted by the literature. Credit channel seems to operate rather through the degree of capitalisation and bank's size. A plausible reason is the structural overliquidity of the banking sector. On the other hand, the pass-through from the market interest rates to the loan and deposit rates is in general not slower than in the euro zone.","2002-12-01","2023-03-14 16:47:24","2023-03-14 16:47:24","2023-03-14 16:47:24","","","","","","","Monetary Transmission in Poland","","","","","","Rochester, NY","en","","SSRN Scholarly Paper","","","Social Science Research Network","","","","C:\Users\Enzinger\Zotero\storage\5ZEPFLHL\Wrobel und Pawlowska - 2002 - Monetary Transmission in Poland Some Evidence on .pdf","","","interest rate pass-through","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","395741","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

For each economy, the same identification scheme is imposed and the dynamic responses to a monetary shock are examined in the light of the predictions of monetary theory. The results suggest that the VAR model produces sensible impulse response functions for most of the economies, especially for the sample that ends before the 1997 Asian financial crisis. Given the openness of these economies, the exchange rate plays a significant role in the formulation of monetary policy. In order to capture explicitly the importance of the exchange rate in these economies, plausible weights are also imposed on the exchange rate to identify the model.","2002-09-01","2023-03-14 16:47:27","2023-03-14 16:47:27","2023-03-14 16:47:27","","","","","","","","","","","","","Rochester, NY","en","","SSRN Scholarly Paper","","","Social Science Research Network","","","","C:\Users\Enzinger\Zotero\storage\ZC8FEAB6\Fung - 2002 - A VAR Analysis of the Effects of Monetary Policy i.pdf","","","East Asia; monetary policy shocks; VAR","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","846184","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We find that the capability of monetary policy to influence economic activity and inflation is still limited, as important channels of monetary transmission are not fully functional. In particular, the interest rate channel remains weak, even though there is some evidence of transmission to prices of changes in the repo rate, the central bank's new operating target for inflation. As in other emerging and transition economies with a high degree of dollarization, the exchange rate channel has a strong impact on the inflation rate. Moreover, we find that inflation does respond to broad money shocks, once foreign currency deposits are included.","2006-11-01","2023-03-14 16:47:29","2023-03-14 16:47:29","2023-03-14 16:47:29","","","","","","","Transmission Mechanisms of Monetary Policy in Armenia","","","","","","Rochester, NY","en","","SSRN Scholarly Paper","","","Social Science Research Network","","","","C:\Users\Enzinger\Zotero\storage\G7SALAZP\Dabla-Norris und Floerkemeier - 2006 - Transmission Mechanisms of Monetary Policy in Arme.pdf","","","Era Dabla-Norris; Holger Floerkemeier; SSRN; Transmission Mechanisms of Monetary Policy in Armenia: Evidence from VAR Analysis","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","944086","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this paper, we carry out a controlled experiment using a structural vector autoregression (SVAR) model to trace the effects of monetary policy shocks on output and prices in Nigeria. We make the assumption that the Central Bank cannot observe unexpected changes in output and prices within the same period. This places a recursive restriction on the disturbances of the SVAR. We conduct the experiment using three alternative policy instruments i.e. broad money (M2), Minimum Rediscount Rate (MRR) and the real effective exchange rate (REER). Overall, we find evidence that monetary policy innovations carried out on the quantity-based nominal anchor (M2) has modest effects on output and prices with a very fast speed of adjustment. While, innovations on the price-based nominal anchors (MRR and REER) have neutral and fleeting effects on output. We conclude that the manipulation of the quantity of money (M2) in the economy is the most influential instrument for monetary policy implementation. Hence, we recommend that central bankers should place more emphasis on the use of the quantity-based nominal anchor rather than the price-based nominal anchors.","2009-12-31","2023-03-14 16:47:34","2023-03-14 16:47:34","2023-03-14 16:47:34","","","","","","","Measuring the Effects of Monetary Policy Innovations in Nigeria","","","","","","Rochester, NY","en","","SSRN Scholarly Paper","","","Social Science Research Network","","","","C:\Users\Enzinger\Zotero\storage\8CRPB94U\Chuku - 2009 - Measuring the Effects of Monetary Policy Innovatio.pdf","","","Monetary innovations; output effect; price effect; structural vector autoregression","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","1534227","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
