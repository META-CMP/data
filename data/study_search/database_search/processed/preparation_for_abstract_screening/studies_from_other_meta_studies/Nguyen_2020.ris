TI  - Monetary Policy Transmission in India: A Peep Inside the Black Box
AU  - Khundrakpam, Jeevan
AU  - Jain, Rajeev
AB  - Using SVAR models on quarterly data for 1996-97:1 to 2011-12:1, the paper examines the relative importance of various transmission channels of monetary policy to GDP growth and inflation in India. It finds that external exogenous factors prolong the impact of monetary policy transmission on GDP growth and inflation in India, while removing the problem of ‘price puzzle’. Among the various channels of transmission, interest rate channel, credit channel and asset prices channel are found to be important, while exchange rate channel is weak. A positive shock to policy rate leads to slowdown in credit growth with a lag of two quarters and subsequently impacts GDP growth and inflation negatively. The same monetary policy shock has a negative impact on asset prices from the third quarter onwards and, in turn, has a pronounced negative impact on GDP growth and inflation. Exchange rate channel is found to have an insignificant impact on GDP growth, but has non-negligible impact on inflation. Interest rate channel is found to account for about half of the total impact of monetary shocks on GDP growth and about one-third of the total impact on inflation, indicating that interest rate channel is the most important channel for monetary policy transmission in India.

T2  - The Singapore Economic Review
AB  - This paper evaluates the monetary policy response of Malaysia's central bank and the nature of monetary transmission mechanism in the 1990s when the exchange rate was on a managed float and the capital account was open. Structural vector autogression analysis is employed to evaluate how the central bank sets short term interest rates taking into consideration the constraints faced in adjusting the policy instrument to shocks to the economy. The impulse response functions and the variance decomposition indicate that the central bank preferred to use foreign exchange intervention rather than interest rate to stabilize the ringgit exchange rate. The results suggest that a sustained high level of interest rates would have caused a prolonged and deep contraction in output during the East Asian financial crisis.

AB  - Empirical macroeconomics is plagued by small sample size and large idiosyncratic variation. This problem is especially severe in the case of the transition economies. We utilize a mixed-estimation method incorporating prior information from OECD country data to estimate the parameters of a reduced-form transition economy model. An exactly identified structural VAR model is constructed to analyze monetary policy in the transition economies. The OECD information increases the precision of the impulse response functions in the transition economies. The method provides a systematic way to analyze monetary policy in the transition economies where data availability is limited.

AB  - Poland has recently moved to inflation targeting as a strategy for monetary policy. Such a strategy can best be implemented with some understanding of the linkages between the policy variables and inflation outcomes. This paper finds that the exchange rate played a dominant role as a policy instrument in the 1990's. However, linkages between the short-term interest rate and inflation have been weak. Given this finding, modification of some details of the strategy, such as widening the target range or lengthening the target horizon, would be helpful. J. Comp. Econ., March 2001 29(1), pp. 24–39.

T2  - China Economic Review
AB  - We investigate the transmission mechanism of monetary policy in China over the past decades with emphasis on the post-Asian crisis period. A factor-augmented VAR method is used to study the effectiveness of monetary policy instruments in stabilizing the Chinese economy. We find that repo rate, benchmark lending rate, and a market-based monetary stance have little impact on the Chinese economy, and are only mildly effective when the exchange rate is more market-determined. The non-market-based measures of People's Bank of China, such as growth rates of total loan and money supply, are effective in adjusting the real economy and price level. Given the slow pace of exchange rate reform, China is likely to continue employing non-market-based policies in the near future.

AB  - This paper compares impulse responses to monetary policy shocks in the euro area countries before the EMU and in the New Member States (NMS) from central–eastern Europe. We mitigate the small-sample problem, which is especially acute for the NMS, by using a Bayesian estimation that combines information across countries. The impulse responses in the NMS are broadly similar to those in the euro area countries. There is some evidence that in the NMS, which have had higher and more volatile inflation, the Phillips curve is steeper than in the euro area countries. This finding is consistent with economic theory. Copyright © 2009 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - This paper examines the efficacy of monetary policy in the South African economy using a data-rich framework. We use the Factor-Augmented Vector Autoregressive (FAVAR) methodology, which contains 110 monthly variables for the period 1985:02-2007:11. The results, based on impulse-response functions, provide no evidence of the price puzzle observed in traditional Structural Vector Autoregressive analysis and confirm that monetary policy in South Africa is effective in stabilising prices. Unlike the traditional vector autoregressive approach, the FAVAR methodology allows further analysis of a large number of variables. Variables from real and financial variables react negatively to a contractionary monetary policy shock. Finally, we find evidence of the importance of a confidence channel transmission following a monetary policy shock.

TI  - Has the Chinese economy become more sensitive to interest rates? Studying credit demand in China
AU  - Koivu, Tuuli
T2  - China Economic Review
T3  - Symposium on Economic Consequences of Urbanization and Urbanization Policy in China
AB  - Chinese authorities have traditionally relied mainly on administrative and quantitative measures in conducting monetary policy, with interest rates playing a less prominent role. Additional support for this view resides in a number of earlier studies that have found that the impact of interest rates on the real economy has been miniscule. However, taking into account numerous reforms in the financial sector and more widely in the Chinese economy, interest rates may have gained some influence in the last few years. It is important to study the effectiveness of interest rates also in light of future reforms of the monetary policy tools in China. Whereas administrative policy measures were effective in guiding the behaviour of state-owned enterprises, the authorities may need to increase the use of more market-oriented monetary policy tools as the share of the economy in private and foreign ownership grows. We use a vector error correction model to study, within a credit demand framework, whether the impact of interest rates in China has become stronger over the last decade. Our results suggest that loan demand has indeed become more dependent on interest rates, albeit the channel from interest rates to the real economy is still weak.

T2  - Eastern European Economics
AB  - This paper estimates the monetary transmission mechanisms in four inflation-targeting new EU members: the Czech Republic, Hungary, Slovakia, and Poland. We use a structural vector error-correction model to identify the monetary shock with long-run restrictions. We find that a restrictive monetary shock has a significant negative effect on the inflation rate in all the countries considered. In response to a one-percentage-point shock in the nominal interest rate, inflation falls by half to one percentage point and returns to steady state after four to six months. Therefore, inflation targeting is likely to be an effective strategy on these countries' way to join the European Monetary Union. The policy might also be a relevant option for future EU member states.

It is also found that the Thai monetary transmission mechanism has important international dimensions. More specifically, monetary contraction has stronger negative effects on import demand in the short run even though import prices fall.

TI  - Is There a Bank Lending Channel in Southern African Banking Systems?
AU  - Lungu, Mark
T2  - African Development Review
AB  - Abstract: Macroeconomic models currently used by policymakers generally assume that the functioning of financial markets can be fully summarized by financial prices, because the Modigliani and Miller (1958) theorem holds. However, the assumption that this theorem holds is questionable. This paper argues that there are frictions in the market which traditional models based on the Modigliani and Miller theorem fail to take into account in explaining how monetary policy and other shocks are transmitted to the economy and points to new directions. A comprehensive macroeconomic model should incorporate financial market interactions to enhance the understanding of the transmission mechanisms of monetary policy and other shocks. If market dynamics are not taken into account, macroeconomic models used by policymakers may point to wrong policy choices. Motivated by the lack of assessment of the recently launched financial reforms, deregulation, consolidations, financial innovations and joint payment systems, the paper assesses the process of monetary transmission mechanism by investigating evidence of a bank lending channel in SADC during the period 1990–2006 using data from the banking sector. Data from a panel of banks is used to identify shifts in the loan supply curve in response to changes in monetary policy using a vector autoregression (VAR) model. Although the results are mixed the paper generally reports the existence of a bank-lending channel in all SADC countries in the sample. The take-off point for monetary policy effects differs from one country to another.

AB  - This paper provides evidence on monetary policy transmission for five key emerging market economies: Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa. Monetary policy (interest rate) shocks are identified using modern Bayesian methods along with the more recent sign restrictions approach. We find that contractionary monetary policy has a strong and negative effect on output. We also show that such contractionary monetary policy shocks do tend to stabilize inflation in these countries in the short term, while producing a strongly persistent negative effect on real equity prices. Overall, the impulse responses are robust to the alternative identification procedures.

AB  - This paper investigates monetary policy and basic macroeconomic relationships involving output, inflation rate, interest rate, and money in Brazil. Based on a vector autoregressive (VAR) estimation, it compares three different periods: moderately-increasing inflation (1975-1985), high inflation (1985-1994), and low inflation (1994-2000). The main results are the following: monetary policy shocks have significant effects on output; monetary policy shocks do not induce a reduction in the inflation rate in the first two periods, but there are indications that they have gained power to affect prices after the Real Plan was launched; monetary policy does not usually respond rapidly or actively to inflation-rate and output innovations; in the recent period, the interest rate responds intensely to financial crises; positive interest-rate shocks are accompanied by a decline in money in all the three periods; the degree of inflation persistence is substantially lower in the recent period.

T2  - South African Journal of Economics
AB  - This paper sets out to investigate the process through which monetary policy affects economic activity in Malawi. Using innovation accounting in a structural vector autoregressive model, it is established that monetary authorities in Malawi employ hybrid operating procedures and pursue both price stability and high growth and employment objectives. Two operating targets of monetary policy are identified, viz., bank rate and reserve money, and it is demonstrated that the former is a more effective measure of monetary policy than the latter. The study also illustrates that bank lending, exchange rates and aggregate money supply contain important additional information in the transmission process of monetary policy shocks in Malawi. Furthermore, it is shown that the floatation of the Malawi Kwacha in February 1994 had considerable effects on the country's monetary transmission process. In the post-1994 period, the role of exchange rates became more conspicuous than before although its impact was weakened, and the importance of aggregate money supply and bank lending in transmitting monetary policy impulses was enhanced. Overall, the monetary transmission process evolved from a weak, blurred process to a somewhat strong, less ambiguous mechanism.

The results suggest that monetary policy shocks, which are identified as money supply disturbances, have a persistent effect on real output, and more than half of the volatility in real output can be explained by changes in the money supply. Furthermore, the analysis reveals that stock prices are a more significant transmission channel of monetary policy than bank loans.

AB  - In large industrial economies, changes in monetary policy affect real economic activity in the short run but only prices in the long run. In transition economies, the question of whether monetary-policy variables affect output in the short run is open. In this paper, we examine the real effects of monetary policy in Russia, Ukraine, Belarus, and Kazakhstan using time-series methods. We find mixed evidence that money matters in these countries, although the effects are greater in Russia. Hence, we conclude that activist monetary policy will have only a limited scope in these countries in the near term. Journal of Comparative Economics 33 (3) (2005) 441–461.

T2  - South African Journal of Economics
AB  - We develop a structural cointegrated vector autoregressive (VAR) model with weakly exogenous foreign variables, known as an augmented VECM or VECX*, suitable for a small open economy like South Africa. This model is novel for South Africa in two ways: it is the first VECX* developed to analyse monetary policy and the first model that uses time-varying trade weights to create the foreign series. We impose three significant long-run relations (augmented purchasing power parity, uncovered interest parity and Fisher parity) to investigate the effect of a monetary policy shock on inflation. The results suggest the effective transmission of monetary policy.

AB  - Using the vector autoregressive methodology, we present estimates of monetary transmission for five new EU member countries in Central and Eastern Europe with more or less flexible exchange rates. We select sample periods to estimate over the longest possible period that can be considered as a single monetary policy regime. To identify the vector autoregression (VAR), structural restrictions and the widely used Cholesky ordering are employed. We conclude that the structural VAR yields much better results. Fewer countries suffer from a price puzzle (i.e., an increase in prices following a monetary contraction). Our results also indicate that there are substantial differences in monetary transmission across the countries in our sample.

AB  - This paper studies the monetary transmission mechanism in Thailand. It examines the degree of pass-through from money market rates to retail rates, attempts to quantify the lags associated with monetary policy shocks, and investigates the channels through which these shocks are propagated. The empirical results point to a transmission mechanism in which investment is particularly sensitive to monetary shocks and banks act as an important conduit for monetary policy to real activity. They also suggest, however, that problems in the corporate and banking sectors may have undermined the monetary transmission mechanism over the last few years.

TI  - Monetary policy and financial stability: empirical evidence from Central and Eastern European countries
AU  - Cocriş, Vasile

T2  - Baltic Journal of Economics
AB  - The international financial and economic crisis highlights that central banks should go beyond their traditional emphasis on low inflation to adopt an explicit goal of financial stability. Our paper addresses this highly topical issue of macro-prudential framework with the focus on effectiveness of monetary policy in affecting some financial stability indicators, in the experience of several Central and Eastern European countries during 2003M01–2012M06. Using a Structural Vector Autoregressive model and impulse response function, we analyze the impact of short-term interest rates upon industrial production, loan to deposit ratio for the banking system, stock prices and exchange rate (proxy variables for financial stability). We want to test if the interest rate is conducive to financial stability. Our empirical results show that the effectiveness of the short-term interest rate in affecting selected asset prices depends on monetary policy strategy. In the case of the Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland and Romania, the interest rate instrument used for inflation targeting is conducive to financial stability. Among countries with a fixed exchange rate regime, only in Bulgaria does transmission of the foreign interest rate impulse to domestic variables promote financial stability. Additionally, our results show that in Latvia and Lithuania adjustments to the monetary policy of the European Central Bank (ECB) are not in accordance with country-specific conditions. The paper contributes to a policy debate on the design of macro-prudential polices in the aftermath of the boom-bust cycle experienced by the Central and Eastern European countries in the second half of the last decade.

T2  - Applied Economics
AB  - A coherent method to measure the effectiveness of a monetary policy improves the monetary authority’s management capacity and renders the possibility of applying sound policies prior to and during a crisis. The trend in employing complicated and ambiguity-bearing unconventional monetary tools in the aftermath of the 2008 crisis has increased the value of such a method. The aim of this article is to introduce a coherent and consistent monetary policy evaluation method for Turkey. Accordingly, we suggest that innovations in the spread between overnight interest rates and Treasury auction interest rates are informative for exchange rate, output, and prices. Empirical evidence for this identification reveals that positive innovation in spread (implying a tight monetary policy measure) decreases output temporarily, permanently decreases prices, and appreciates local currency. This result is also robust to alternative specifications.

The empirical evidence suggests that positive innovations in the spread between the Central Bank’s interbank interest rate and the depreciation rate of the local currency mimic the properties of the tight monetary policy. These innovations, when they are positive, decrease income and prices, and appreciate the local currency. For prices and the exchange rate, the effects are permanent; but for income the effect is transitory.

AB  - The article provides empirical evidence on the effects of monetary policy shocks in the three largest new European Union (EU) economies: Czech Republic, Hungary and Poland. Vector autoregression (VAR) system estimates show that the co-movement of macroeconomic variables, conditional on a monetary policy shock, is similar across these countries and, despite their lower degree of financial development, not dissimilar to that found for more advanced European economies. While qualitatively similar to the responses observed in the old EU members, the responses of the new members are, on average, weaker.

AB  - This paper examines the monetary transmission mechanism in Egypt against the background of the central bank's intention to shift to inflation targeting. It first describes the changing transmission channels over the last decade. Second, the channels are evaluated in a VAR model. The exchange rate channel plays a strong role in propagating monetary shocks to output and prices. Most other channels (bank lending, asset price) are rather weak. The interest rate channel is underdeveloped but appears to be strengthening since the introduction of the interest corridor in 2005, which bodes well for adopting inflation targeting over the medium term.

TI  - Estimating Impacts of Monetary Policy on Aggregate Demand in India
AU  - Khundrakpam, Jeevan Kumar
AB  - Using a structural VAR model on quarterly data from 2000Q1 to 2011Q1, this paper
estimated the impact of monetary policy on aggregate demand in India. The overall
impact on aggregate demand is then decomposed to observe the differential impact
among the various components. It finds that an interest rate hike has a significant
negative impact on the growth of aggregate demand. However, the maximum impact
is borne by investment demand growth and imports growth. Impact on private
consumption growth and exports growth are relatively far more subdued, while there
is hardly any cumulative impact on government consumption growth as it increases
after some marginal fall initially. Variance decomposition analysis indicates that
interest rate accounts for a significant percentage of the fluctuation in the growth of
all the components of aggregate demand, except government consumption. Further,
interest rate channel completely dominates exchange rate channel in monetary
transmission, though the latter channel has non-negligible impact on investment and
imports.

T2  - Applied Econometrics and International Development
AB  - This paper deals with the monetary policy transmission channels of six Central European countries: CEECs – Hungary, Poland, Czech Republic, Romania, Slovakia and Slovenia – over recent periods corresponding to stable monetary regimes. We will take into account three channels – the interest rate, the exchange rate and the domestic credit – whose relative importance will be accounted for using a structural VAR model. The results show that all the countries share a weak domestic credit channel while they are highly heterogeneous with regards to the relative effectiveness of the interest rate and exchange rate channels. Thus, Hungary and Poland’s distinctive feature is the presence of a price puzzle effect combined with a high influence of the exchange rate which acts both as a mechanism of monetary policy transmission and as a supply and demand shock absorber. On the contrary, just like in the case of the Euro zone countries, it is the interest rate channel that has the major influence in the case of the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Slovenia and partially Romania. Therefore, this latter group appears to be more apt to join the EMU in the near future, which can be confirmed by the Slovenian case.

AB  - This paper considers empirical evidence for a small open economy, characterizing and identifying the dynamic effects of both foreign and monetary policy shocks on Chilean macroeconomic variables. A structural VAR approach is used with non-recursive contemporaneous restrictions. Several interesting results appear in the analysis. First, consistent with the predictions of a stochastic rational expectations model, a domestic monetary contraction generates a transitory fall in output and monetary aggregates. Second, there is no evidence of price and exchange rate puzzles. Third, the source of Chilean output, price level, and real exchange rate volatility is similar to that identified in industrial countries: monetary policy explains a relatively small proportion of output, price level, and exchange rate variability. Finally, foreign monetary policy innovations have very short-lived effects on domestic interest rates and have no major influence over other Chilean macroeconomic variables; while risk premium shocks influence significatively both the interest rate and the exchange rate.

The analysis is made in the context of an economy described by a mix of institutional and market behaviors illustrated by a SVAR model in which the restrictions imposed on the coefficients underline the adopted behavior hypotheses. The behavior of the four economic variables, as reflected by the SVAR analysis, is consistent with the measures adopted by the National Bank of Romania after the 2008 economic crisis. In this respect, the results underline three main aspects: 1) the importance of the interest rate channel; 2) the key role of demand, and of stimulating the demand through the right economic measures; 3) the complex impact of the exchange rate channel.

In this paper we consider the implications of monetary policy under the inflation targeting regime in Romania, based on an autoregressive vector method including recursive VAR and structural VAR (SVAR). Therefore, we focus on assessing the extent and persistence of monetary policy effects on gross domestic product (GDP), price level, extended monetary aggregate (M3) and exchange rate. The main results of VAR analysis reflect a negative response of consumer price index (CPI), GDP and M3 and positive nominal exchange rate behaviour to a monetary policy shock, and also a limited impact of a short-term interest rate shock in explaining the consumer prices, production and exchange rate fluctuations.

AB  - This paper utilizes VAR techniques to examine the relationship between a policy related variable and selected macro-variables in China. Johansen’s cointegration tests fail to find a moving equilibrium among the related variables. Based on a VAR model in first differences, we find that an unexpected temporary one-off shock to the change in the seven-day money market interbank borrowing rate does not have significant influence on GDP changes but a significant influence on price level changes in a “wrong” direction. Empirical testing demonstrates that the seven-day Repo rate has an insignificant influence on both GDP changes and on the price level changes. Furthermore, the relationships between monetary aggregate (M2) and short-run money market interest rates suggest that the short-run interest rates do not have significant influence on the monetary aggregate. Therefore, we have determined that short-run money market interest rates are ineffective as a monetary policy-operating objective.

TI  - Monetary Policy Transmission in Mauritius Using a VAR Analysis†
AU  - Tsangarides, Charalambos G.
T2  - IMF Working Papers
AB  - Applying commonly used vector autoregression (VAR) techniques, this paper investigates the transmission mechanism of monetary policy on output and prices for Mauritius, using data for 1999-2009. The results show that (i) an unexpected monetary policy tightening-an increase in the Bank of Mauritius policy interest rate-leads to a decline in prices and output but the effect on output is weaker; (ii) an unexpected decrease in the money supply or an unexpected increase in the nominal effective exchange rate result in a decrease in prices; and (iii) variations of the policy variables account for small a percentage of the fluctuations in output and prices. Taken together, these results suggest a rather weak monetary policy transmission mechanism. Finally, we find some differences in the transmission mechanism depending on whether core or headline consumer price index is used in the estimations.

TI  - Estimating the effect of Hungarian monetary policy within a structural VAR framework
AU  - Vonnák, Balázs
AB  - A standard approach in measuring the effect of monetary policy on output and prices is to estimate a VAR model, characterise somehow the monetary policy shock and then plot impulse responses. In this paper I attempt to do this exercise with Hungarian data. I compare two identification approaches. One of them involves the ‘sign restrictions on impulse responses’ strategy applied recently by several authors. I also propose another approach, namely, imposing restrictions on implied shock history. My argument is that in certain cases, especially in the case of the Hungarian economy, the latter identification scheme may be more credible. In order to obtain robust results I use two datasets. To tackle possible structural breaks I make alternative estimates on a shorter sample as well. The main conclusions are the followings: (1) although the two identification approaches produced very similar results, imposing restrictions on history may help to dampen counterintuitive reaction of prices; (2) after 1995 a typical unanticipated monetary policy contraction (a roughly 25 basis points rate hike) resulted in an immediate 1 per cent appreciation of the nominal exchange rate (3) followed by a 0.3% lower output and 0.1-0.15% lower consumer prices; (4) the impact on prices is slower than on output; it reaches its bottom 4-6 years after the shock, resembling the intuitive choreography of sticky-price models; (5) using additional observations prior to 1995 makes identification more difficult indicating the presence of a marked structural break.

TI  - Monetary Transmission in Poland: Some Evidence on Interest Rate and Credit Channels
AU  - Wrobel, Ewa
AU  - Pawlowska, Malgorzata
AB  - In the paper we show the macroeconomic effects of a monetary policy shock using both recursive and non-recursive SVAR decomposition. We find that the responsiveness of the CPI index and output in Poland is smaller and slower than in the euro zone. Using panel data we check how bank-specific characteristics affect operation of the lending channel. In contrast to the results for the euro area the degree of liquidity of an average bank seems not to work in a way predicted by the literature. Credit channel seems to operate rather through the degree of capitalisation and bank's size. A plausible reason is the structural overliquidity of the banking sector. On the other hand, the pass-through from the market interest rates to the loan and deposit rates is in general not slower than in the euro zone.

TI  - A VAR Analysis of the Effects of Monetary Policy in East Asia
AU  - Fung, Ben S. C.
AB  - In this paper, a VAR model is used to study the effects of monetary policy shocks in seven East Asian economies. For each economy, the same identification scheme is imposed and the dynamic responses to a monetary shock are examined in the light of the predictions of monetary theory. The results suggest that the VAR model produces sensible impulse response functions for most of the economies, especially for the sample that ends before the 1997 Asian financial crisis. Given the openness of these economies, the exchange rate plays a significant role in the formulation of monetary policy. In order to capture explicitly the importance of the exchange rate in these economies, plausible weights are also imposed on the exchange rate to identify the model.

TI  - Transmission Mechanisms of Monetary Policy in Armenia: Evidence from VAR Analysis
AU  - Dabla-Norris, Era
AU  - Floerkemeier, Holger
AB  - This paper examines monetary policy transmission in Armenia in light of the authorities' intention to shift to an inflation-targeting regime over the medium term. We find that the capability of monetary policy to influence economic activity and inflation is still limited, as important channels of monetary transmission are not fully functional. In particular, the interest rate channel remains weak, even though there is some evidence of transmission to prices of changes in the repo rate, the central bank's new operating target for inflation. As in other emerging and transition economies with a high degree of dollarization, the exchange rate channel has a strong impact on the inflation rate. Moreover, we find that inflation does respond to broad money shocks, once foreign currency deposits are included.

AB  - The purpose of our paper is to evaluate the effectiveness of monetary policy transmission mechanism in Romania, via interest rate channel. Using a Vector Error Correction Model and impulse response analysis, we study the impact of a positive monetary policy shock via short term interest rate on macroeconomic variables over the period 2003M01-2012M06. Our empirical results are in line with economic theory and we can say that we are witnessing to an improvement in the transmission effectiveness of monetary policy impulses via interest rate channel.

TI  - Measuring the Effects of Monetary Policy Innovations in Nigeria: A Structural Vector Autoregressive (SVAR) Approach
AU  - Chuku, C. A.
AB  - Correctly identifying the effects of monetary policy innovations is necessary for good policy making. In this paper, we carry out a controlled experiment using a structural vector autoregression (SVAR) model to trace the effects of monetary policy shocks on output and prices in Nigeria. We make the assumption that the Central Bank cannot observe unexpected changes in output and prices within the same period. This places a recursive restriction on the disturbances of the SVAR. We conduct the experiment using three alternative policy instruments i.e. broad money (M2), Minimum Rediscount Rate (MRR) and the real effective exchange rate (REER). Overall, we find evidence that monetary policy innovations carried out on the quantity-based nominal anchor (M2) has modest effects on output and prices with a very fast speed of adjustment. While, innovations on the price-based nominal anchors (MRR and REER) have neutral and fleeting effects on output. We conclude that the manipulation of the quantity of money (M2) in the economy is the most influential instrument for monetary policy implementation. Hence, we recommend that central bankers should place more emphasis on the use of the quantity-based nominal anchor rather than the price-based nominal anchors.

TI  - A VAR Analysis of Kenya's Monetary Policy Transmission Mechanism: How Does the Central Bank's Repo Rate Affect the Economy?
AU  - Cheng, Kevin C.
AB  - This paper examines the impact of a monetary policy shock on output, prices, and the nominal effective exchange rate for Kenya using data during 1997-2005. Based on techniques commonly used in the vector autoregression literature, the main results suggest that an exogenous increase in the short-term interest rate tends to be followed by a decline in prices and appreciation in the nominal exchange rate, but has insignificant impact on output. Moreover, the paper finds that variations in the short-term interest rate account for significant fluctuations in the nominal exchange rate and prices, while accounting little for output fluctuations.

TI  - Monetary Policy Transmission in an Emerging Market Setting
AU  - Patnaik, Ila

T2  - IMF Working Papers
AB  - Some emerging economies have a relatively ineffective monetary policy transmission owing to weaknesses in the domestic financial system and the presence of a large and segmented informal sector. At the same time, small open economies can have a substantial monetary policy transmission through the exchange rate channel. In order to understand this setting, we explore a unified treatment of monetary policy transmission and exchangerate pass-through. The results for an emerging market, India, suggest that the most effective mechanism through which monetary policy impacts inflation runs through the exchange rate.

TI  - Monetary Policy Transmission Mechanism In Romania - A Var Approach
AU  - Andries, Marius Alin
T2  - Theoretical and Applied Economics
AB  - From the central bank’s point of view, the transmission of monetary policy to the economy is of distinguished interest among various topics of macroeconomics. Without being aware of the monetary transmission mechanism it is not possible to conduct good policy. This paper applies the identified VAR methodology to synthetic national data from 2000 till Q2 2007 to study the macro-economic effects of an unexpected change in monetary policy in Romania.

AB  - This paper has employed the use of multivariate modelling techniques in examining the dynamic behaviour 
of systemic and non-systemic shocks on macroeconomic variables in Ghana with the main aim of having 
some level of understanding of how monetary policy decisions and actions affect inflation and output. A 
structural  vector  error  correction  model  (s-vecm)  was  developed  utilising  information  from  estimated 
cointegrating  relationships.  Using  a  7  variable  system,  the  analysis  was  carried  out  by  examining  the 
dynamic  nature  of  generalized  impulse  response  functions  generated  from  the  model.  The  study  found 
strong evidence of monetary policy instruments affecting inflation and output in the Ghanaian economy in 
the long run and that the exchange rate channel remains the main medium through which monetary policy 
acts.
