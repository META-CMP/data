"PCCAJRNZ","journalArticle","2014","Nguyen, Ha","Monetary transmission mechanism analysis in a small, open economy: the case of Vietnam","University of Wollongong Thesis Collection 1954-2016","","","","https://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/4286","The transmission mechanism of monetary policy describes the dynamic stages in which a central bank’s monetary policies are transmitted to real output and prices. It plays a crucial, perhaps even central, role in the study of monetary economics. However, few studies have focussed on developing small, open economies, and even fewer have covered characteristics such as the aggregate demand components, the low independence of monetary policy, the weak developing financial markets and structural changes in the economy. Few quantitative empirical studies have been conducted on the monetary transmission mechanism in Vietnam, and they do not include a non-recursive structural vector autoregression model with structural breaks, and characteristics of a small, open economy. This study attempts to fill such research gaps. The aim of this thesis is examining the role of monetary policy in the Vietnamese economy, in terms of shocks to the economy via different channels, and the international dimension of the monetary transmission mechanism in the small, open economy of Vietnam. To answer these questions, the study uses quarterly data for the period 2000:1 to 2011:4 and the Structural Vector Autoregression (SVAR) approach. The SVAR is more suited than the Vector Autoregression (VAR) approach to examining structural shocks as a test of multivariate models. The findings show that the statistically significant break dates are found in this study, so a dummy variable is included in the SVAR model of Vietnam. The study’s findings reveal that the impacts of a monetary contraction on domestic variables are largely consistent with theories, except for its impact on price level. A monetary contraction causes the output to decrease, but weak. The monetary channels explain about 20 percent of fluctuations in real output. The higher output causes the domestic price to increase. A money shock is not a main reason in increasing the domestic price because of its small and statistically insignificant effects. Vietnam’s current price-controlling regimes are effective in ensuring price stability in spite of shocks in world oil and rice prices. The outcomes of this research illustrate that the interest rate channel is the most effective channel for transmission to the price fluctuations and the exchange rate for output variations. The study found the stock price channel as the least effective, which is consistent with the modest role of the stock market in the Vietnamese economy. This limits the statistically significant contemporaneous effects of monetary policy (the interest rate and credit) on stock prices. The monetary aggregate could not be a reliable tool to contemporaneously transmit monetary policy signals to the financial market. In addition, the study finds that domestic shocks have a more significant impact on the Vietnamese economy than foreign shocks do. Policymakers need to focus on solving the internal problems of the economy. However, they should keep a keen eye on some foreign factors in the short run because of significant effects of foreign output on domestic output, of foreign output on the monetary aggregate, of world gold price on the monetary aggregate, and of world rice price on the domestic price. In the analysis of aggregate demand components, significant contemporaneous relationships (the domestic price-exports, the domestic output-imports, and exports-stock prices) are evident. These relationships suggest policymakers’ cautious consideration on the trade-off between economic growth and price stability. Imports and exports are quickly affected by a monetary contraction; however, negative impacts on import demand contribute to improvements in Vietnam’s trade balance in the short run. The credit channel plays an important role in trade activities. The role of the exchange rate channel is less for prices, imports, and exports. Finally, the results illustrate that the effects of a monetary contraction on private investment and private consumption are consistent with economic theory and expectation, but these responses occur in a short time. The influence of monetary transmission channels on private consumption is higher than that on private investment. In this study, there is no evidence of the output and forward discount puzzles. The puzzles of price, liquidity and exchange rate are addressed but they are transitory, occurring in the short run and disappearing over time. Based on the major findings, this study suggests some policy recommendations: (i) there is a need to focus on solving the internal problems of the Vietnamese economy to create a strong motivation for the development of Vietnam; (ii) monitoring the important transmission channels, including the interest rate, exchange rate and credit channels in formulating monetary policy; coordinating monetary policy with other policies to effectively control inflation in Vietnam.","2014-01-01","2023-03-28 10:48:44","2023-03-28 11:05:32","","","","","","","","Monetary transmission mechanism analysis in a small, open economy","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","https://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/4286/","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We find that the responsiveness of the CPI index and output in Poland is smaller and slower than in the euro zone. Using panel data we check how bank-specific characteristics affect operation of the lending channel. In contrast to the results for the euro area the degree of liquidity of an average bank seems not to work in a way predicted by the literature. Credit channel seems to operate rather through the degree of capitalisation and bank's size. A plausible reason is the structural overliquidity of the banking sector. On the other hand, the pass-through from the market interest rates to the loan and deposit rates is in general not slower than in the euro zone.","2002-12-01","2023-03-28 10:48:45","2023-03-28 10:48:45","2023-03-14 16:02:07","","","","","","","Monetary Transmission in Poland","","","","","","","en","","","","","Social Science Research Network","","Place: Rochester, NY","","","https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/Delivery.cfm/SSRN_ID395741_code030513500.pdf?abstractid=395741&mirid=1","interest rate pass-through","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, the assumption that this theorem holds is questionable. This paper argues that there are frictions in the market which traditional models based on the Modigliani and Miller theorem fail to take into account in explaining how monetary policy and other shocks are transmitted to the economy and points to new directions. A comprehensive macroeconomic model should incorporate financial market interactions to enhance the understanding of the transmission mechanisms of monetary policy and other shocks. If market dynamics are not taken into account, macroeconomic models used by policymakers may point to wrong policy choices. Motivated by the lack of assessment of the recently launched financial reforms, deregulation, consolidations, financial innovations and joint payment systems, the paper assesses the process of monetary transmission mechanism by investigating evidence of a bank lending channel in SADC during the period 1990–2006 using data from the banking sector. Data from a panel of banks is used to identify shifts in the loan supply curve in response to changes in monetary policy using a vector autoregression (VAR) model. Although the results are mixed the paper generally reports the existence of a bank-lending channel in all SADC countries in the sample. The take-off point for monetary policy effects differs from one country to another.","2007","2023-03-28 10:48:48","2023-03-28 10:48:48","2023-03-14 16:13:01","432-468","","3","19","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Wiley Online Library","","","","","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdfdirect/10.1111/j.1467-8268.2007.00170.x","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Impact on private consumption growth and exports growth are relatively far more subdued, while there is hardly any cumulative impact on government consumption growth as it increases after some marginal fall initially.

Additional support for this view resides in a number of earlier studies that have found that the impact of interest rates on the real economy has been miniscule. However, taking into account numerous reforms in the financial sector and more widely in the Chinese economy, interest rates may have gained some influence in the last few years. It is important to study the effectiveness of interest rates also in light of future reforms of the monetary policy tools in China. Whereas administrative policy measures were effective in guiding the behaviour of state-owned enterprises, the authorities may need to increase the use of more market-oriented monetary policy tools as the share of the economy in private and foreign ownership grows. We use a vector error correction model to study, within a credit demand framework, whether the impact of interest rates in China has become stronger over the last decade. Our results suggest that loan demand has indeed become more dependent on interest rates, albeit the channel from interest rates to the real economy is still weak.","2009-09-01","2023-03-28 10:57:20","2023-03-28 10:57:20","2023-03-14 16:38:20","455-470","","3","20","","China Economic Review","Has the Chinese economy become more sensitive to interest rates?","Symposium on Economic Consequences of Urbanization and Urbanization Policy in China","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","; ","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1043951X08000175/pdfft?md5=58fc5306e927973f17624ec112052e1a&pid=1-s2.0-S1043951X08000175-main.pdf&isDTMRedir=Y; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1043951X08000175?via%3Dihub","China; Monetary economics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
