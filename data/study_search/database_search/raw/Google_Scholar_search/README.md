# Raw data from Google Scholar database search

Here you find the original data we retrieved from [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/).

## Search query and software used:

We entered the following search queries into the Google Scholar database using the software [Publish or perish]() (Harzing, A.W. (2007) Publish or Perish, available from https://harzing.com/resources/publish-or-perish; Version: 8.8.4275, 11 January 2023) and retrieved the maximum number of results for each query. Note that according to Google it should be possible to retrieve a maximum of 1000 results per search, in practice however, for most queries we received a server error when trying to retrieve more than 980 results.
